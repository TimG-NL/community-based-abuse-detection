6	fatpeoplehate	Same old bullshit , thinking that losing weight is about buying something you wouldn't otherwise buy ( fresh veggies and gym membership ) . Don't worry about changing what you eat ( at first , at least ) , just fucking EAT LESS . Don't buy a fucking gym membership if you're not going to go . Run laps around your damn house , do pushups , lunges , anything that gets your heartrate up for <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> minutes . If doesn't cost any money to lose weight - and you should end up spending LESS on food , you fat fuck . The ONLY thing it takes to lose weight is self-control , which means feeling some discomfort when you get hungry and can't stuff your face with an entire pizza . Apparently the discomfort of eating less is SO MUCH FUCKING WORSE THAN BEING TOLD THAT YOU ARE HIDEOUS AND FAT BY ALL OF THE PEOPLE YOU CLAIM ARE FAT-SHAMING YOU . Lazy fucking whales ...	EXP

91	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

Literally the children shared McDonald's fries for dinner .. his parents were not the nicest people ever , and I felt so bad for the poor kid and his siblings . I wanted so badly to scoop them all up and get them some real dinner ... A couple days later I ran into the mother and told her that if she ever needed a night off to send the kids over and I'd cook dinner for them and entertain them .

In a lot of cases law enforcement is known to occasionally be attacked or overrun ( especially in the case of what's happening in Europe right now ) Literally through history when a certain group migrates to a country where they are the minority ( Italian to Chinese and everything in between ) They all migrate to one area and accumulate , eventually leading to a form of segregation after some time it's little Italy , or Chinatown etc . and throughout history no matter the race these places generally have more crime especially towards "" outsiders "" . Again evidently these crimes used to be more petty theft , Nothing compared to what's happening to Europe after the Middle Eastern refugee crisis that's a fact . Pregnant women , little girls weren't getting stabbed because they're wearing a T-shirt , and priests weren't executed in his church in the name of buddha ; however sexual assaults were probably always more common just not to the extent where <NUMBER> + migrants and refugees supposedly trying to escape violence all execute over <NUMBER> sexual assaults in the span of <NUMBER> hours , well unless it's in Cairo and other islamic countries where mass sexual assaults executed in a particular way seem to be a correlation maybe even a tradition .

275	uncensorednews	Paywall so Poland triggered a showdown between eastern and western Europe yesterday when its MPs voted to give parliament the power to appoint supreme court judges , despite the threat of sanctions from Brussels . The European Commission had warned that the legislation would undermine the separation of judicial and political powers , seen as a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law . On Wednesday it gave Poland a week to rethink the plans and to avoid sanctions : the suspension of its full EU membership by the withdrawal of its voting rights , a measure that has never been used against a member state . Thousands of people protested against the legislation in Warsaw yesterday , many waving EU flags This enraged the Polish government , which yesterday won the backing of Hungary to resist European officials . Tensions have been running high in some of the former communist nations , which are resisting the EU ’ s insistence that every member state must take a share of refugees . The latest dispute began when Poland ’ s ruling Law and Justice Party rushed through a bill proposed only last week to give the justice minister the power to appoint judges to the supreme court . Further powers for the minister to organise the work of the court and decide which judges should remain were switched to the president under an amendment last night designed to make it more palatable to Brussels . The bill quickly followed one that was approved last week , giving parliament control over the National Council of the Judiciary . Jaroslaw Kaczynski , leader of Law and Justice party , sits at the centre of the front row as his party votes to pass the controversial measureJaroslaw Kaczynski , leader of Law and Justice party , sits at the centre of the front row as his party votes to pass the controversial measure “ Collectively , they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government , ” Frans Timmermans , vice-president of the commission , said , adding that the changes would “ considerably increase the systemic threat to the rule of law ” . Polish MPs voted by <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> , with <NUMBER> abstentions , to pass the bill and send it to the upper house today , where it is certain to pass thanks to the Law and Justice Party ’ s majority there . The final step to becoming law will be the signature of President Duda , a lawyer who used to be a Law and Justice MP , but who ran as an independent for the presidency in <NUMBER> . Crowds gathered in Warsaw last night calling for him to veto the bill . Donald Tusk , the former prime minister of Poland who is now president of the European Council , called for a solution to a “ very serious situation ” . He said that he has proposed a meeting with Mr Duda to try to avoid “ bleak outcomes which could ultimately lead to the marginalisation of Poland in Europe ” . He added : “ They transport us , in the political sense , in time and in space backwards and eastwards and ruin an already tarnished public opinion of Polish democracy . ” Mr Duda ’ s office said the president had rejected the offer of a meeting with Mr Tusk . During yesterday ’ s debate , Adam Bodnar , Poland ’ s human rights ombudsman , told parliament that the legislation would “ deprive citizens of the right to an independent court ” , adding : “ We are planting an explosive under our judiciary . ” Law and Justice said that it wanted to shake up the top court because it had become a “ state within a state ” and lacked accountability . It was heavily criticised for making political appointments to the constitutional court in <NUMBER> , but escaped EU censure . Jaroslaw Kaczynski , chairman of the party , said that “ far-reaching , radical actions ” were required because the judiciary had not been reformed since communist times and was inefficient . Opposition politicians , judges and European officials criticised the vote . Grzegorz Schetyna , head of Civic Platform , the main opposition party , denounced the bill as an “ announcement of a coup ” . Malgorzata Gersdorf , president of the supreme court , said that the bill would transform it into a “ court attached to the justice ministry ” . She added : “ This is very dangerous for the political system we are living in . ” Krystian Markiewicz , president of Iustitia , the Polish judges ’ association , also described the proposed change to the law as a “ coup ” . “ The rule of law and democracy are ending , the independence of powers is over , ” Mr Markiewicz said . “ The minister will appoint the judges that he favours . ” He added that the measure was introduced “ at night , completely out of the blue , with no social consultation ” and “ does not fit into EU standards ” . Hungary said that it stood by Poland and warned the commission not to meddle in Poland ’ s internal affairs . Peter Szijjarto , the Hungarian foreign minister , added : “ We stand by Poland and we call on the European Commission not to overstep its authority . ” Mr Timmermans said on Wednesday that the commission could invoke Article <NUMBER> of the EU treaties , which could lead to voting rights in the Council of the European Union being suspended . The article was set up to hold countries accountable for human rights violations , but the ultimate step of suspension would require unanimity , with Hungary unlikely to support the move . Interesting comment I wonder how many commenting on the current crisis in Poland have the first-hand knowledge of the issues and how many speak to the language to understand what this battle is really about . This article misses a few very important facts as it doesn't make it clear that the opposition party who lost the last elections ie the Civic Platform have a large and powerful representation in Brussels and Donald Tusk and friends make it very difficult for the current government to reform the institutions of the state that were never working under the previous government . For many years the judges were politically appointed and no one bat an eyelid ! Suddenly this is a problem when the new government tries to formalise the practice . This article fails to mention a number of financial frauds that have rocked the country recently which prompted the reform of the judiciary and the legal system . As I understand thousands of investors lost their deposits and government-owned property was misappropriated with the full knowledge and cooperation of the legal profession . While the Civic Platform was in power these crimes were never investigated and the judiciary actively prevented anyone from probing any further . Why this is never reported here ? All we get is the photos of protests and no explanation whether the legal system in Poland has ever functioned at all ?	EXP

598	politics	"The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited . Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

679	uncensorednews	"Obviously democracy is a "" figment of human imagination "" . It's a concept . We could be easily living in a society where leadership isn't dictated by voting , but that's not the case . I assume you're American , I'm Canadian . Since we live in democracies , and I'm a citizen that contributes to society , I have the right to vote for the leadership that will directly impact my life . It doesn't matter what gender you are , what your IQ is ( btw , lol ) . As long as you're a legal citizen who contributes to society , you have the right to vote . Simple . Yeah , it's biological fact that there are differences between men and women . This isn't a new discovery . What isn't true is the fact that a woman's cycle makes her an unstable human being lol . Yes , hormones fluctuate and can cause mood swings . Sure there are some women who suffer from PMDD and it can be severe . Women who suffer from PMDD or suffer severe symptoms from their menstruation cycle still aren't unstable humans lol , they aren't out there slaughtering people by the dozens or disrupting society as a whole . I'm a woman , I happen to know a lot of other women , <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % of the women I know aren't emotional wrecks before , during , or after their period . Maybe take your information from a source other than tongue in cheek memes about periods lol Were you aware that men also have fluctuating hormone levels that can cause them to , by your standards , be unstable human beings . As a human your hormones aren't at a constant , perfectly balanced level your whole life . Yes , Germany has a female chancellor and they are experiencing an immigration crisis . Just like a lot of Europe , as you pointed out . I'm pretty sure the rest of those political leaders are men , though . So it's specifically just women's "" fault "" , regardless of the fact that men are still making these decisions in the majority of countries . That actually makes sense to you ? Just to reiterate , literally every woman voted for these guys / one girl , not one man voted for them ? And the men enacting these policies aren't a problem . Just the female voters . It's even more ridiculous that you completely look right past the basic issue of the immigration crisis . Who are we concerned about in the immigrant demographic ? Women and children ? No ? Oh yeah , it's the men that are the problem . In fact , let's take a look back at history . Who started all the wars , genocides , mass slaughterings etc . Biology says that men are more violent , maybe men shouldn't be allowed to vote or hold public office . I mean , history backs me up . Men cause too much bloodshed and are too focused on violence to effectively run a country . Yup , women should just run the world . That's just a ridiculous way to think , it honestly blows my mind that you actually think these things ? Like you're not just trolling ? I could keep going on and actually put effort into my reply , but I'm not <NUMBER> % sure you're actually serious . I can't believe I actually took this time to reply to you . Keep your hilariously sad opinion , obviously I'm not gong to change your mind . Maybe when you actually meet a few women irl you'll grow up . I don't have much hope for you , though . That being said , I hope it makes you incredibly uncomfortable knowing that a woman will be the chief engineer of a nuclear power plant , ready to literally and figuratively melt down because muh hormones ."

701	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

This isn't rocket science , nor is this fat logic you ham . The plus sizes are frumpy and not on trend . Neither are fat people , your point ? They are frequently many seasons out of date fashion-wise and insultingly obsessed with being ' flattering ' ( covering up your fat bits ) . How many fatties do designers intend for their works to be showcased in ? How many people make sketches and think "" You know , this would look great in a size <NUMBER> instead of a size <NUMBER> "" . None , and that's why their clothes are loved by us people who care about and respect our bodies enough to treat them by looking good in clothes . They're covering up your fat bits because the rest of us don't want to see them you delusional ham . Also , Target is always flirting with completely removing their plus size clothing from their physical stores . Because they suck . Well if you want to compete with Wal-Mart , this is how you do it . Let the competition live with the stigma of being a hovel for lard-asses . Wal-Mart has a pretty decent selection of extended sizes . My point . Now when you hear someone make fun of fat people ( by which they also mean working class people ) [ Take it away Lex ] ( <URL> You can also call that person a fatphobic , classist asshole . You'll have to forgive me , what about that is a bad thing ? Forever <NUMBER> has their women's plus size line completely segregated into what is basically a whole different store . Good .

974	AdviceAnimals	"Here's a story : In Algebra <NUMBER> I had serious issues with a teacher who failed me because I didn't show work . Every homework would get zero credit because I didn't show work . The teacher's reason ? I could have stolen the answers from somebody . "" Fair enough , "" I said . Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it . So I failed Algebra <NUMBER> while passing the state algebra test and getting 99th percentile in those stupid state tests . Now I'm in college taking Calculus <NUMBER> , and still not showing work for algebra problems .

Thankfully most Christians in the West have decided to ignore most of the "" bad "" parts , such as : - If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . They must be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . Leviticus <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - When you march up to attack a city , make its people an offer of peace . If they accept and open their gates , all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you . If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle , lay siege to that city . When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand , put to the sword all the men in it . As for the women , the children , the livestock and everything else in the city , you may take these as plunder for yourselves . And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies . This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby . Deuteronomy <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> - You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you . You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners , including those who have been born in your land . You may treat them as your property , passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance . You may treat your slaves like this , but the people of Israel , your relatives , must never be treated this way . Leviticus <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> - All that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you . Leviticus <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material . Leviticus <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - Now therefore , kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man intimately . But all the girls who have not known man intimately , spare for yourselves . Numbers <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> Obviously there are lots more , but you get the idea .

1254	leagueoflegends	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight . The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities .

The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron .

Most of them probably never even stop to think that most meals at many restaurants are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> times bigger than they should be portion wise . The life of a fatty is centered around food . Every part of the day is centered around shoveling food into their mouth . So the idea of someone eating a small portion , or sharing something that they could eat several of is very foreign . I think that is partly why they feel the need to speak up but the other part is just crabs in bucket mentality . They have to try to drag others down to be like them . All you can do is ignore them . People who lack the self control to know when to stop eating are hardly in any right state to remark on the habits of others food wise .

1493	uncensorednews	"Quit relying on statistics as a crutch to prove some kind of "" point "" . You understand you just asked me to ignore facts , right ? Anyhow , whites haven't done shit for blacks . Decades of aid to numerous African nations says otherwise , especially considering this aid has saved millions of black lives . Speaking of black lives - The standard of living for blacks in white nations is astronomically higher than anywhere else they reside . Blacks built society , inarguably . Actually that can be easily argued because their societies are dog shit , bereft of the countless luxuries you take advantage of everyday . The only reason you black violence is considered "" disproportionate "" , is because all factors of violence aren't included in statistics . You know it , and i know it . What factors ? Socioeconomic ? Oh is this where you try to justify <NUMBER> % of the population committing the majority of rape and murder by saying they're poor ? I might be able to believe this if the majority of the poor in the United States weren't white . The poorest region in the United States is the Appalachians and it is overwhelmingly white . Despite this , the Appalachians is not as dangerous as virtually every black region in the nation and again despite whites being the majority of the poor , they don't commit the majority of violent crime . The "" societies and cultures of Europeans "" aren't "" unquestionably superior "" . I can call that bullshit on that all day long , champ . Is that why you're living in one ? You speak a European language . You type away on white inventions . You use standards wrought from European minds . You survive off medicine brought into the world by European men . You are nothing without white people . All whites do is leave a trail of death , destruction , and misery in their wakes . I'm gonna cite a real-world example of this being absolutely false by bringing up Rhodesia . You know what that is ? It was a nation built by Europeans in Africa and nothing was really in the region but a few black tribes that still struggled with the concept of abstract thought . Nonetheless the European introduced an agricultural movement so stunningly efficient that it fed itself and the neighboring regions , that includes those black tribes I mentioned who had joined Rhodesia , many times over . Eventually , blacks demanded that Rhodesia be handed back to them and the leader of this movement violently usurped the whites in charge and Rhodesia became Zimbabwe . Guess what happened after that ? All that agriculture came crashing down . Rhodesia is a starving third world hell hole and the dictator Mugabe has literally begged white people to return and feed them . We leave ruin ? Destruction ? Misery ? Ha . Those things were the standard before whites came along . The fact that you think the majority of the of whites are white supremacist trash like you , makes me laugh . They're not . I'm just stating objective facts . Me ? I'm probably not superior to anyone but I'm not going to pretend white societies and their unimaginable contributions to mankind aren't superior to numerous other ones . If there were a race war to kick off like shitbag cucks like you dream about , you'd get rolled right the fuck over . People are getting sick of your primitive & insecure mentality . It would be <NUMBER> all over again . But much , much , worse on your end . You're kidding right ? You're vastly underestimating how good white people are at massacring others when they mobilize and you're probably one of those silly muds that pretends it's going to be whites vs everybody else . It won't and I have bad news for negroes - You have no friends . No other race can tolerate you like whites have and as far as the United States go ? You're <NUMBER> % of a population with most of your soldiers sitting in prison . That's not even considering how Hispanics have spent the last decade chasing blacks out where they formerly were .

1542	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

1606	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

Do it in public and you've got a problem , not that I agree it should be a problem . I understand the nature or policing people . I'm huge about minding your own business .

2023	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

2268	europeannationalism	I was aware that the nobility had to speak French , but I don't recall them actively forcing the populace to speak French as well . In any way , you can't say this was a bad thing , especially since you may be overestimating the amount of romance words actually spoken in daily English . You're also probably overestimating the amount of people that knew how to write altogether . I believe the already few people that could write with runes ended up adopting the latin alphabet just because it was much more important at the moment . The Norman invasion of England contributed to your cultural growth and shaped your people accordingly , just like when my country ( Italy ) was invaded by Ostrogoths and Lombards . Neglecting all of that seems pretty stupid to me . I mean , I can speak Latin but I can't obviously expect other Italians to do the same . But I feel like all of this is derailing from the topic of this post . It's completely fine if you feel like all of this can help the English language , but it'd be foolish not to consider that it'd be a great deal of work that may not even be considered useful by many of your people .

Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ? "" Because they've learned to be guarded with guys lest their friendliness be mistaken for attraction . Or maybe this girl is just really open . Or maybe she actually just genuinely likes you as a human being ! You're not her emotional boyfriend ; she's your emotional girlfriend . You cutting her off might hurt her , but she'll survive and she'll date and otherwise get over it . For you , it will definitely hurt because you have the most to lose . That's why she's your emotional girlfriend . You're stuck in an awkward point in your dating timeline . It's going to suck getting through this , but you need to focus on things you can control . The only thing you can control here is you . Focus on yourself and getting as healthy as possible . Invest everything you have into yourself . Go to the gym , read self-help books , meet new people , find a therapist , pick up that hobby you've been putting off , go travel , have fun with your friends , learn how to be at ease with yourself , but stretch yourself as much as you can . You'll learn more about yourself , you'll learn how much you're capable of , and you'll learn what you like and what you're good at and what sort of people you don't like .

There was obviously some limit in place , which by all logic would be tailored to the individual subject . There is no point in saying x is the limit for all , when not all people will use x calories in a day . And your inability to form a coherent point or , for that matter , understand one led you to repeatedly calling a few ( correct ) posters stupid . It stands though , if they are stupid and correct , then what the hell are you ? Clearly I was wrong earlier , you couldn't possibly be anywhere near medicine . If you are , thank goodness you are not involved in my health care system . The point of calorie restriction as a consistent ( at least for the majority of days ) process is where the benefits are reaped - obviously it is known that a positive energy balance creates fat gain and that is not healthy , so it is required that a healthy weight is maintained ... but there is not point in me saying all of this .

But no . your source , one policeman on a rant . Is better than the whole literature combined that's been meta-analyized and contextualised and studied . Also , please don't call a rant a statistic .

Of course I am not saying that no one is to blame or that it is completely risk free to allow refugees to seek asylum . However , this is one of the biggest moral challenges in our ever growing , ever globalizing world .

I hope we don't have to look at them in the eye and tell them : "" Im sorry . We thought we were doing the right thing . "" Because I know you and everyone else like you are not stupid . Not irrational . You truly believe that this is what's best for European countries and ours too probably . But that isn't true . And if you look outside your own political bubble you'll find evidence for it too . So please look . Just a little bit harder .

3285	gaming	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

He only said that _after_ the Beatles had broken up and he was in a negative space about them . When George left during the Get Back sessions , he was very vocal in keeping the group going and was secretly recorded in personal conversations with Paul and Yoko about keeping the band together . Yoko visited Paul and asked him to talk to John about coming back when her own personal relationship on the side was over . Yoko obsessively called John almost on a daily basis , according to both John and May Pang during their separation . So John didn't come crawling back by any means .

3513	europeannationalism	I am a National Socialist , and I'd be happy to explain what that means . National Socialism is a bit of a misnomer since it was used during a time Socialism could refer to any ideology that appeals to the interests of the workers , while not necessarily being a Pro-class struggle or Communist ideology . It would be more accurate to call National Socialism a Corporatist ideology . Like other forms of Fascism , National Socialism advocates for a system that protects private property and allows for a market economy , but the State promotes and ensures that there is class unity as opposed to class struggle , healthy class relations that are beneficial for all involved . NS is in favor of Nationalism and ethnocentrism . We believes that every nation's and every race's autonomy should be preserved . This doesn't mean every nation is isolated from each other , but National Socialism is against globalism and globalization . Foreigners are allowed to exist within a NS nation , but they have to respect the society they are in and follow the law of foreigners . The interests of the nation and society are held deeply . We advocate for a one-party meritocratic government that chooses and promotes leaders based on their competence and gives them accountability proportionate to the power they hold . National Socialism opposes the Liberal concept of democracy , but this does not mean we're against all forms of voting and other citizen participation in government . The Third Reich itself held multiple plebiscites and citizens were empowered to become involved in their communities . Society in general will be built around meritocracy . The amount of effort and good you produce will determine what you get from society . There will be incentives for people to improve their bodies , their minds , and their communities . There will be incentives for those who benefit their communities , and their nation directly or indirectly . These incentives will likely come in the form of access to additional social services and other benefits . Aside from that , there are many different interpretations of National Socialism . If you have any questions , feel free to ask me . I'll even suggest you some additional reading if you want more in-depth perspectives related to National Socialism . Let me know if you need more recommendations . Suggested Reading - Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler This is mostly a biographical look at Hitler's life and his political views , it's a long read and is in a conversational tone that may be hard to read . However , it may help you understand Adolf Hitler a little more . The Programme of the NSDAP by Gottfried Feder This is a good book for the actual politics of the NSDAP . It outlines the social , political , and economic foundation of National Socialism in Germany . I highly recommend it . White Power by George Lincoln Rockwell This is a good book for learning about Rockwell's post-war interpretation of National Socialism and is a decent introduction to the American strain of NS in general . National Socialism : Vanguard of the Future by Colin Jordan . This is another book written after World War II and the subsequent fall of the German Reich . It's a collection of several essays on the topic of Germany and National Socialism . Who We Are by William Luther Pierce Another good piece of literature on the topic of National Socialism , in general I'd recommend Pierce's work . He sometimes goes under the pen name Andrew Macdonald , so just be aware of that .	EXP

However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it .

3918	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

In the democratic process , when passing new laws and new legislation , the argument "" It doesn't affect you "" simply isn't good enough . That's what most tyrants say , and since America has devolved into a nation of meddlesome busybodies who want to tell everyone else what to do this sort of thing is hardly surprising even if it terribly disappointing . I would argue there is no bigger form of acceptance and validation than passing gay marriage legislation . I could make a compelling argument that the sky is purple . That doesn't mean I'm right .

4534	uncensorednews	I hear you , a lot of people haven't been exposed to that kind of epidemic . However a closer inspection by the medical community reveals that people don't really ' OD ' on cocaine but have long term cardiac disease , similar to fried chicken . The majority of deaths in the cocaine trade , by FAR , is violence between drug sellers . Heroin is a horrible evil addiction and overdosing is a real possibility . However many overdoses occur because of the wide spectrum of potency . Some heroin is so supplemented with other ( dangerous ) stuff that the user barely gets high ; and some is so powerful it will kill the user . Not knowing the potency of the drug is what leads to many overdoses . There are also the many longer term health effects of intravenous heroin use , often caused by sharing needles and using poor venipunture technique . A heroin user with a steady supply of consistent heroin who uses good aseptic technique can live a long time ( William Burroughs ) , not that that seems like a happy life . My point is that if you really hate the deaths and lives wrecked by drugs close inspection will reveal their illegality is a leading factor . Sometimes hating drugs so much leads us to hate them at the expense of saving lives . That is what's happening in America .	EXP

4677	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

4818	uncensorednews	If you aren't going to argue like an adult , don't be surprised when actual statistics prove you wrong . Let's look at these statistics alone shall we ? A report by the Washinon Post which can be read here ; <URL> Statistics , however , suggest that the gun bans alone did not have an immediate impact on firearm-related crime . Over time , however , gun violence in virtually all its guises has significantly come down with the aid of stricter enforcement and waves of police anti-weapons operations . The most current statistics available show that firearms were used to kill <NUMBER> people in all of England and Wales in <NUMBER> , compared with <NUMBER> such homicides that same year in Washinon , D . C . , alone . So in ONE single city we had more homicides than the entirety of England and Wales combined . Britain has seen one mass shooting since its most onerous gun ban went through in <NUMBER> , with criminologists arguing that a <NUMBER> rampage in the British countryside could have been worse had the perpetrator had access to stronger firepower . Today , law enforcement officials say ballistic tests indicate that most gun crime in Britain can be traced back to fewer than <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> illegal weapons still in circulation . As an example of how having access to better guns would have made things worse . But starting in <NUMBER> — and following years of anti-gun sweeps by police forces in British cities that made illegal guns far less accessible — gun violence began to ebb . In <NUMBER> , England and Wales recorded <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> offenses involving firearms , down <NUMBER> percent from their peak in <NUMBER> . Given that British crime statistics also count fake guns as “ firearms , ” criminologists say the number of violent crimes involving real guns is likely significantly lower . <URL> Shows that it is still .. bar large cities almost negligible . And that's including counting fake guns , inflating that number . Meaning it literally is almost negligible . Seriously are you just a gun nut ?	EXP

4856	sjwhate	"I never said "" modern "" leftist . You did . You falsely attributed that to me , called it wrong thus creating a principle for consistency , and then immediately ignored that very principle thus being logically inconsistent . You yourself claimed that I was wrong by claiming that I attributed modern leftism to the founding fathers ( and that this isn't accurately descriptive ) , then you yourself attributed modern Libertarianism to the founding fathers . The founding fathers were mostly leftists by virtue of being left of center . Many of the features of their ideology and the tenets in their writings are still leftist , and were mostly leftist for the time period . Those Libertarian features you are seeing ? Those were left of center in <NUMBER> . I . e . , leftist . Many ideals you would consider conservative today were leftist then . As you yourself said , modern leftism has changed . I don't think you realized how , because only one of your examples encompasses a minority of leftist ideologies ( "" pro-socialist policies "" ) . And , believe it or not , expanding the role of federal government into people's lives is also a very Fascist belief , with the understanding that people are naturally irrational and need government control . Fascism is very , very conservative , yet it's also leftist ? You're also taking a very naive view of conservativism . These aren't just political ideologies ; you can't compare conservatism's social aspects to liberalism's financial aspects , for example , and call it an accurate comparison . Conservatives ( of which Liberatarians are a part of , not a complimentary group or some such nonsense like you seem to think ) care very much about morality , as does literally every other person , everywhere . Modern conservatives care about the Constitution , but the ideas the ideology is founded on existed long before the Constitution . Protection of minority rights from majority rule is the single most basic tenet of conservatism , contrasted with the leftist idea of supporting the majority . Realism ( vs idealism ) , and traditionalism are other basic and so far unchanged tenets . Would you call the founding fathers realists ? Traditionalists ? Did they protect the minority opinion from the majority ? You could say they did in the sense that they wanted religious freedom , and then say they didn't in the sense that itself was a majority opinion . Traditionalism has resulted in different features in different cultures too ; for example , liberal economics are seen as conservative in the U . S . because the U . S . was originally and traditionally liberal economically . Christian moral theory and adherence to the constitution are features of U . S . conservatives due to tradition as well . Some features that are attributed to conservatives are really just conservative political parties taking opposing sides on issues to spite other parties ; gun control is both a far left and far right policy , for similar reasons : an armed populace is tough to oppress . So , to sum it up , you only gave a single leftist tenet in your examples , and that suffers from the same problem as we had before : modern Socialism isn't the same as it was when it was in its infancy , right around the time of the revolution . At the time it was the belief that there needs to be some minimum level of control over mercantilism , precursor to modern capitalism . As the majority of the founding fathers were Federalists , they can be said to have supported similar ideas though I do not know if they were explicitly aware of the existence of Socialism . While not declaring whether they ( the Federalist Party ) were primarily left or right , they were supportive of a mercantile economy as an alternative to the existing plantation-based economy , but they also supported the idea of a strong federal government so that states wouldn't be forced to individually deal with their own or other states ' problems ( and economic bullshit ) . Starting to sound less like the ideology you know and love ? Actually , this polarization we see today didn't even become a thing until the mid-twentieth century . Party loyalty was nearly nonexistent , and parties weren't measured on a right-left axis outside adademia . But something you should note is that today's liberals become tomorrow's conservatives . Your views were once further left than they currently are , because leftists love change and conservatives hate it . I'm deliberately using "" leftist "" instead of "" liberal "" for most of this too , because while liberals are leftist , leftists aren't necessarily liberal and there are some very distinct and disturbing non-liberal ideologues in leftism . I personally believe the right-left axis , or newer double axis , isn't adequate to measure the difference in direction of most ideals anymore , as Social Justice Theory is no friend of Liberalism ."

Oh that's right , because multiculturalism is only pushed on white nations , everyone else is allowed to maintain homogeneous countries . If you haven't noticed , America is on the verge of a fucking race war . This does not bode well for your claim that multiculturalism is a success . Culture is ethnic . You cannot separate the two . Look at the self-segregation that is naturally happening in America if you need proof of this . Go to Japan , see what they think of multiculturalism . See how they feel about other Asians living there . See how they feel about hafus who are born there to one Japanese parent , if they are considered Japanese . This is not a foreign concept . And no , white men did not purchase and bring over African slaves . Every single one of those slave ships were Jewish owned and operated . As for the native Americans , they were not a monolithic people . They were many separate tribes who were at war with each other , killing their own kind , forming alliances with the settlers to fight neighboring tribes . ( Unless you believe they just materialized horses out of thin air . ) Well when somebody shows up who was better at war and your numbers were too small to occupy the amount of land that is being disputed , contains so infastructure and isn't being used for anything , not hard to imagine the result . At first you wanted the Irish out I never said that . They are Europeans so they fit into a country founded by Europeans .

The economy is unstable , cost of living is rising , social tensions are mounting ... And for what , so we can have cheap labor and authentic tacos ? If these people are such a boon to society , they need to be in their homelands so they can fix their countries for their children , not leaving it to burn so they can benefit from a society that somebody else created . Perhaps America was destined to fall . Even cohesion between different European cultures doesn't happen naturally . Sometimes I wish my ancestors never left Europe . I wish I had an older culture to live with . I love American culture , but it is a departure from what I could have had . Working against ethnonationalism benefits no one , no matter how you'd like it to be true . ( By the way , you just said "" it benefits everyone "" and then don't give any reasons why .

5265	politics	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

I heard them talking to the front desk guy about the place , cue attempted flirting , and then ask if they actually had to wear climbing shoes after the rentals struggled to fit on to their fat feet . He told them it wasn't necessarily required and they went on their way to the walls . I saw them a couple times around and each time they would really just be climbing up the walls , not using the paths or problems and they took so much time that it just created a group of people waiting for them to finish . I heard one of them comment how easy climbing was and that's when I had it . I went up to them and told them that you want to stay on the obviously color coded path in order to do the problem correctly . They looked so confused but then they attempted to try it . Luckily they were on a V2 and failed miserably , couldn't even get up from the start . They eventually left defeated but not before taking some selfies . You would think they would actually try to research a bit about climbing before coming it to attempt it but hams are too lazy and they just want that instant gratification of looking like they exercise .

Ideally you want to maintain a very high amount of protein in your diet when you are cutting . Without getting into the science you want at least . 8g protein per pound of LEAN body mass a day .

5337	uncensorednews	"So for those of you not willing to read that wall of text ... the TL ;D R for science illiterates is : Sex = Penis , Vagina , or Intersex ( combination of gonads ) . This is based on chromosomal makeup that tells your cells during early development whether to form a penis or a vagina or in some cases , or a combination of gonads in an array of forms dependent on the situation . These are the physical markers , generally , as to whether someone has sperm or eggs to contribute to reproduction . Any variations on this has existed as long as the human species has existed as far as is understood . Gender = Societal construct of ' man ' vs ' woman ' ( in Western societies - it differs throughout the world and has hard or soft constructs depending on what definition you go by ) . These constructs are based socially and have almost entirely to do with ' performative gender ' . This is not at all the same thing as the "" sex "" of a person nor should it be interpreted as such within a narrow field of view . Gender is understood by sociology and anthropology as being a spectrum . Any variations on this has existed as long as the human species has socially existed as far as is understood . They are two distinct things . One being the chromosomes you are born with and the scientific interpretation of those chromosomes based on our current understanding . The other , being the social interpretation and understanding of behaviors and performance that has more to do with humans interact as individuals ( that being most of the time ) when they are not actively attempting to reproduce or rear children . For whatever reason , in the past few decades the terms "" gender "" and "" sex "" have been used interchangeably to describe an obscure hybrid of these two ideas . This etymology is false and needs to be corrected to encourage a greater understanding of the issues at hand . If anyone better qualified to answer the questions involved in this topic is on hand , I would greatly encourage you to contribute as I only have the information that was passed on to me during general anthropology , sociology , psychology , and health sciences on hand . EDIT : I realize "" both or a combination of gonads "" might be confusing . EDIT <NUMBER> : Also , I'm starting to see that my TL ;D R was almost as long as the original post but didn't have half as much information because I was trying to put it into basic terms . So refer to the original post , because it's better .

5438	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

Without doing any googling , what I remember about the mini-shuttle is that is was a testbed for the SR - <NUMBER> follow-on , sometimes known as the ' Aurora ' , and not intended as a production craft . I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

These are all half-ton trucks , so their max payload is obviously <NUMBER> lbs . I think we can assume these hams are at least <NUMBER> each , so the truck would be capable of safely carrying them if they were evenly distributed through the bed . Instead , their weight is all on the tailgate , out past the rear axle . For this , I think the to win maximum tongue weight is most appropriate . For the layman , this describes how well a trailer is balanced over its own wheels . Basically , you want the truck dragging the trailer , not necessarily lifting it . For these <NUMBER> trucks , I got a ballpark of <NUMBER> lb maximum tongue weight . It's safe to say that driving the poor little truck that could in this condition would cause permanent and severe damage to the rear suspension and drivetrain . Statically , obviously the drivetrain is safe . The suspension is likely experiencing accelerated wear due to these hammies getting on and off to go get food , etc , but not as bad as if it were carting them over bumps and whatnot .

They were offered VC funding shortly after the wave of FPH folks came over and they turned it down because they did not want to be subject to demands of others . Sort of like Trump turning down money from lobbyists but I digress . Atko and Puttitout are the co-owners of Voat and are not looking to be bought out .

Firing Comey was on the lips of liberals for months , right up until Trump went through with it . Let's not pretend otherwise . How does a press conference off camera in any way delegitimize it ? Did you know he also gave press credentials to dozens of new organizations as well as opened up the press conferences to video calls from small local companies ? Far more than Obama ever did . Yeah he could be golfing less , nothing to do with transparency though . The taxes are really a non issue , to me at least . There's no law requiring it and if he was trying to hide anything in them Mueller would've found it by now .

5833	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

5946	fatpeoplehate	"Fourteen things every fat girl needs to hear ? <NUMBER> ) You eat too fucking much . Quit lying to yourself and others that you don't . <NUMBER> ) At least <NUMBER> % of weight loss is diet . Consume fewer calories than you burn , and you will lose weight , even if you never break a sweat or set foot in a gym . <NUMBER> ) Cleaning up your diet will make eating for weight loss--and maintenance--much , much easier . Healthy , nutritious , whole foods will give your body the nutrients it needs . Stop eating marginally nutritive processed shitfood that is engineered to be addictive . <NUMBER> ) If there are foods you simply can't help but overeat , that you crave , that you binge on ? Consider them trigger foods that you are addicted to , and cut them the fuck out of your diet . Nobody ever has insane , self-destructive cravings for foods that are actually good for them ; whatever your trigger is ( bread , chocolate , sugar , chips , fries , ice cream ) ? You can live without it . <NUMBER> ) Fat people are not attractive , and all the fat acceptance , body love , honoring your curves , and "" sexy "" selfies will not convince the rest of the world ( including most fatties ) that you are beautiful and desirable . <NUMBER> ) No amount of makeup , tattoos , brightly-colored hair , or in-your-face fashion will ever make your fatness interesting , radical , or less repulsive . In fact , they just make you look more repulsive and pathetic . <NUMBER> ) Fatness is not fucking healthy . You're <NUMBER> years old and your lab results are perfect ? Yeah , talk to me when you're <NUMBER> . Tell me how your back and knees feel after a brisk <NUMBER> - mile walk . You've got PCOS and you claim you're healthy ? Dream fucking on . You are living in an imbalanced , diseased state . <NUMBER> ) No , you don't deserve to be loved and desired by attractive people you'd like to pair up with . They don't owe it to you to look past your repulsive exterior and appreciate the "" real you . "" They are not shallow for refusing to do that . The real you has given up , caved in to her appetite , abandoned self-control , and rationalizes consuming more than her share . Your fat body is the real you , for it is the sum of your choices . You are not only unattractive , you are a liability , and anyone who feels they can do better is entitled to reject you . <NUMBER> ) Bragging about how sexually desirable to men fat women are , and how many men you've had sex with , and how "" men want meat , not bones , "" and how men appreciate your gigantic fat tits and not "" fried eggs , "" and making snide remarks about how unattractive skinny women's bodies are , or calling your fat self a "" real woman "" - - and then claiming you're a feminist and fuckyourbeautystandards ? Fuck you . <NUMBER> ) Your physician actually learned things in medical school . In practice , your physician has likely seen a lot of sick fat people making the same excuses you do , telling the same lies about their shitty habits you tell , and thus knows exactly where you're headed if you don't clean up your act . You are not healthy . You will be even less healthy in the future . This is a given . So when they suggest you lose weight because your overloaded knees already hurt at age <NUMBER> ? Don't fucking whine about fat-shaming . Your physician actually cares more about your health than you do , if you've let yourself get to this point . <NUMBER> ) There are a lot of reasons why the typical selection of plus-size clothing is pretty much crap , and why many retailers only carry plus-sizes online . But the bottom line is ... the bottom line . Decisions about what garments to make and how much they will cost and how much retail floor space to give them are all based on profitability . Not fat-shaming , not oppressing "" real women , "" but rather how much money a for-profit business can reasonably expect to make from plus sizes . And they are not obligated to create or stock unprofitable lines , or take less profit on plus-sized lines , or make straight-sized women bear the cost of your overindulgence . Clothing manufacturers and retailers are not obligated to make cute clothes for you at a loss . End of story . <NUMBER> ) If you choose to stay fat , you will always be discriminated against . You will lose out on jobs , promotions , and professional opportunities . No company will want you as their public face ( unless it caters specifically to fatties ) . In a dispute with a thin person , people will automatically believe the thin person over you . Because you are fat , people ( even other fat people ! ) will assume that you lack self-control , self-discipline , initiative , and intelligence . You can't even manage your own body's energy balance ; why should anyone think you're fully competent at anything else ? <NUMBER> ) There are pople who count calories , refuse dessert , eschew processed crapfood , turn down "" treats , "" say no to birthday cake , hit the gym every day , go for a run after work , cut carbs , eat salads , bring their own healthy lunch , or don't clean their plates at every meal . This does not mean they live rigid , joyless , over-controlled lives . They do not usually have eating disorders , or a negative relationship to food ( unlike chronic overeaters ) . They are not , by default , shallow , superficial , or "" image-obsessed . "" They just happen to like living in lean , healthy , attractive bodies . They would like to live a long time , or at least not spend decades sick and disabled by preventable conditions . And they'd like to be able to fully experience life , and what the world has to offer--which is kind of hard to do when your mobility is limited by joint pain , you're always out of breath , and you can't even fit in an airplane seat . Turning down cake and counting calories looks like a great deal , compared to living as a fatty--because it fucking is . <NUMBER> ) When you get sick of being a fatty , the power to change is entirely yours . No , it's not going to be easy . There is no easy . But it's so fucking worth it ."	EXP

6000	fatpeoplehate	I'm male , I will support equality of the sexes until the end of time , but like many other males , the vast majority of my experiences with feminism have been extremely negative . In college , I had the pleasure of meeting many of these fine ladies who were hands down some of the most horrid bitter , sexist people with victim complexes out the ass . I further made the mistake of attending two women's studies courses with stimulating lectures on why all males should be castrated , how men are the root of all societal evils , and how women cannot be sexist . Any sort of rational argument or statistic was dismissed immediately as a ' social construct . ' Words were redefined until they lost all meaning . Any attempt at presenting a differing viewpoint was met with abject hostility and insults . I've lost count of the number of times I've been called patriarch - - one of which was for the injustice of offering to carry the books of a girl who was limping around on crutches . It wasn't until I discovered reddit that I ran into feminists who I considered reasonable and actually seemed interested in equality . I feel bad for said feminists because what was once a great movement has been hijacked by lunatics . To those feminists on reddit , I ask how do you feel about this ? Do you ever wonder why so many males seem to have a complete aversion to feminism ? Either we're all raging misogynists , or there's something very wrong with feminism as a movement . I almost feel as if it should be abandoned and left to the vocal idiots while a new movement for women interested in actual women's issues and equality should be formed .	EXP

What a boring fucking world that would be . The entire point of civilization is that you trade your freedom for security and the ability to exist as a whole . People before civilization were basically just intelligent animals who raped and killed and only cared about the people close by to them and had zero care about humanity as a whole , not much different from your average chimpanzee or any other mammal . Oppression is bad , but living in a civilization regardless of what you think about their government is much better than being a hunter gatherer . If it wasn't for civilization you wouldn't have a computer to type your opinions up on . I hate hillary as well , but I can't believe this is how your acting just because trump is going to lose .

Running in a higher range like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % ( Lactate Range ) bypasses the aerobic zone . ATP , Creatine , glucose and glycogen all get used as lactate levels rise .

6601	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No .

Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force .

CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet .

I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

6856	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

7191	uncensorednews	Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder as defined by the DSM .

Him being messed up in the head , obviously followed the boy because he had a sudden sexual urge . The Afghan man pulls a knife on the kid and forces him to perform oral sex . The boy's father comes in and ask what the heck is happening , but the man says he's helping the kid go to the bathroom . The father is an idiot for believing it . So the Afghan man finishes his business and authorities only find out when the kid admits it later . Forced oral sex is still considered rape and it's terrible that a boy endured this .

7319	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question .

7438	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

7507	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks . Male Hollywood already knows that chick flicks are soul-sucking monstrosities that should be taken out back and shot . Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

Most atheists would be happy to see religion separated from state , and to let other people believe whatever they want ; radical atheists ( cf . Soviet Russia ) would love to see religion banned , and the religious lined up and shot . It goes against the philosophy of atheism ( and humanism , by extension ) , because by forcing people to be atheist , you rob them of the process of reason , self-reflection , and choice . Similarly , Islam and Christianity contain strong messages of peace and charity ( that was Christ's main schtick ) , and going balls-to-the-wall radical and calling for genocide go against at least a few core teachings . Generally , radicals ignore the humanistic side of things in favour of hellfire and damnation .	IMP

7738	holocaust	"Works for me . I'll paste the text here . - - - - - - - - - The Jerusalem Post ( <NUMBER> August <NUMBER> ) article about Krakowski and the Yad Vashem Archives was by the reporter Barbara Amouyal , who wrote that the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem hold <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> such testimonies of "" Holocaust survivors "" . Its director at the time , Shmuel Krakowski , is quoted by Amouyal as declaring that over half are "" unreliable . . . . Many were never in the places where they claim to have witnessed atrocities , while others relied on second-hand information given them by friends or passing strangers . . . . A large number of testimonies on file were later proved inaccurate when locations and dates could not pass an expert historian's appraisal . "" Jamie McCarthy has pointed out to me a subsequent development I overlooked . Krakowski wrote a letter in reply , published on <NUMBER> August ( p . <NUMBER> ) , in which he complained "" I said there are some - fortunately very few - testimonies , which proved to be inaccurate . Why did Amouyal make them out to be a large number ? "" Krakowski did not indicate what changes should be made in the quoted remarks ; e . g . he did not write that he said there were "" very few "" , only that there were very few . It seems unlikely that the problem of fanciful testimonies in the Archives would have come up at all , during the interview , unless it was somehow a pressing practical problem , quite apart from numbers ( "" some "" vs . "" a large number "" ) . Indeed the context of the Amouyal article shows that it was . At the time , Amouyal was covering the forthcoming Demjanjuk trial . Retired Cleveland auto worker John Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian immigrant , had been extradited from the USA in <NUMBER> to stand trial in Israel , accused of being "" Ivan the Terrible "" of Treblinka , who had allegedly gassed hundreds of thousands of Jews there . The trial was held in <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> in Jerusalem . The Amouyal report was written in the context of preparations for the Demjanjuk trial . She mentioned specific testimonies in the Archives of three people who had testified in Demjanjuk's denaturalization hearing in the USA , of whom two , Eliyahu Rosenberg and Pinhas Epstein , were to testify in the Jerusalem trial . Krakowski , for his part , mentioned in the interview one specific class of "" not entirely credible "" testimony ( a quote not contradicted in his August <NUMBER> letter ): "" survivor testimony claiming that Ivan the Terrible was killed in the Treblinka uprising of August <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> "" . Both Epstein and Rosenberg identified Demjanjuk as "" Ivan "" in the Jerusalem trial . Epstein claimed that he recognized Ivan's "" familiar gait as television showed Demjanjuk walking down the gangway from his plane "" ( London weekly Jewish Chronicle , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> , p <NUMBER> ) , and testified to various gory atrocities by Demjanjuk that he had allegedly witnessed ( NY Times , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> ) . Eliyahu Rosenberg was the star witness against Demjanjuk in the Jerusalem trial , and also identified him as "" Ivan "" . Rather early , it was revealed that in <NUMBER> Rosenberg had given a deposition in which he claimed that "" Ivan "" had been killed by inmates in August <NUMBER> ( NY Times , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> ) . He attempted to explain this by claiming that his <NUMBER> statement had actually been based on hearsay , and was erroneous . Late in the trial , however , defense lawyers produced a document , handwritten in Yiddish by Rosenberg for a Warsaw historical institute in <NUMBER> , declaring that he had personally participated in the killing of Ivan in August <NUMBER> , and identifying the immediate killer as one "" Gustav "" ( Cleveland Plain Dealer , <NUMBER> & <NUMBER> Jan . <NUMBER> , Chicago Tribune , <NUMBER> Jan . <NUMBER> ) . With some circumlocution of these and other matters the court found Demjanjuk guilty and sentenced him to death . However it subsequently became obvious to the whole world that Demjanjuk could not have been a guard at Treblinka . Consequently in <NUMBER> , despite all the lying testimonies of <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , he was acquitted and released . He then returned to the USA . The relevant observation for us is that when the Israeli prosecution attempted to use witnesses who had supplied testimonies for the Yad Vashem Archives , the results were those predictable from the Amouyal article , and worse . The sense of the original article was completely confirmed by subsequent events . That sense is that the testimonies in the Archives are essentially "" unreliable "" for practical purposes . In one way or another , regardless of whether he said "" some "" or "" many "" , Krakowski transmitted that idea to the reporter . If Krakowski does not want to take credit for being right , that is his problem , not ours . In journalism it is commonplace for a subject to regret the candor with which he gave an earlier interview . When Demjanjuk's acquittal as "" Ivan "" was confirmed one Esther Raab , who had been silent when Demjanjuk was alleged to have been at Treblinka , popped up to offer her testimony that she recalled Demjanjuk from her stay at Sobibor . The New York Times commented ( <NUMBER> August <NUMBER> ) that "" It is unclear why Mrs . Raab did not speak out until now . "" On the contrary , it is completely clear . I assume her testimony also reposed at Yad Vashem ; if not , her role as a technical advisor for the <NUMBER> TV movie Escape from Sobibor establishes her testimony as being of equal ostensible worth . These matters are "" historiographically important "" . last modification : <NUMBER> May <NUMBER> ."	EXP

I don't need an excuse to hate on Islam . It's theology is repulsive and it's history isn't much better . I take issue with Muslims based on that fact , though I don't hate them for it .

8724	fatpeoplehate	That's a good point without a doubt . What I think is that there will be two obvious points of pressure .

At the same time like you said <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of these people are medically buttfucked by their weight . In regards to social welfare programs , what isn't covered by tax income is financed by the sale of treasury bonds by the federal reserve . The sale of bonds also finances a part of every other federal program . So imagine a day when the Medicare bill sent from the hospitals requires so much of the income generated from the treasury that there is only enough left over to cover social security payments . And everything gets shut down temporarily like we've seen when congress delays spending bills . Unlike political shutdowns , you can't pass a law requiring people not to get sick . I don't know the future but I can see some the possibility of some kind of change to at least how health care is approached . And it's changed before in the past . So maybe .	IMP

8764	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

8930	politics	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : <URL> Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

9077	milliondollarextreme	good point about fractional reserve banking but thats more of a problem with that and not traders , right ? A lot of these types of problems come up with libertarians that make one have to take seemingly paradoxical views sometimes . like gay marriage for example , or debt based issues , or social programs , because these issues come from the current system , and so you cannot insert extensions of a libertarian system in a system which is not libertarian . for example as a libertarian i don't care about how much money we spend as country , because obviously it doesn't matter given the monetary and finance system , the national debt can't be paid off even remotely . It is designed for it to increase exponentially . It's either dismantle the system entirely or don't care . you can't insert libertarian shit within it because it makes no sense . I'm not so sure I understand what your idea is of what can legally be done to change it ? as for HFT , i don't understand your point really . i don't get how it's a toll booth . it's just buying and selling on a micro-scale . Basically , i don't get what you're advocating other than statist regulations . With reality , the list of complaints are endless . doesn't violate rights . that's barely something to care about . Is that really a problem as you suggest ? That an investor has to pay a little more because of the volatility of traders ?

The Jewish people , in modern times , have obtained a sort of impenetrable social armor--you can't criticize the doings of the Jewish state without criticizing the Jewish religion it's based upon . And you can't criticize the Jewish religion because it is the inherited birthright of the Jewish race . The typical gentile knows very little about the Jewish people and this is by design . They teach us in school that the Jewish people are simply just another religion--people who celebrate different holidays like Hanukkah in winter time . The story of Hanukkah itself is often whitewashed for the gentiles , to make us forget that Hannukah is the story of a barbaric , savage revolt of Jews against the Seleucid Empire . The ZOG has conditioned us to associate the dislike , criticism and even the mentioning of Jewish things with the provocative HOLOCAUST : trade_mark : propaganda they showed shoah'ed us in grade school . When you juxtapose the amount of attention the Holocaust receives in media and education with that of the Holodomor , it is very clear that there is an unjust Jewish bias .	EXP

The Soviet Union killed Christians at will in the name of materialist , communist , atheist revolution . They then used the wars as a way to secure Palestine as israel with a British / Allied mandate that stole a nation away from the Ottoman Empire and finally crushed Germany's dominance of world economics despite the Allies colonies . No one likes them because they are cowardly predators who use honest people to fight and die for their profit . They have been a problem in every country they've been in and been thrown out of every country they've been in . Spain , France , Germany , Russia ... They are just like their semite brothers in the Arab world . Savages . They don't care for hard work or ethics , something European nations were built on before they were overrun and globalized . Now they destroy their neighbours in the middle-East because they can't allow them to grow too strong because they've made enemies of everyone . Greater israel . I think it's ironic . They are importing the population that hates them . So be it . There are bigger problems than their feelings .	EXP

9344	islam	What guarantee do I have that the woman I will marry would be right for me ? I think the problem stems from two different notions of marriage . I assume you were raised in the West , so your notion of marriage is very different from a more conservative and traditional idea of marriage . You are looking for a life partner it sounds . In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts . The concept of ' right for me ' doesn't exist in that set up , it's more of ' right for both families ' .	NOT

9348	Christianity	I'm fine with the way it is now . Children can pray in public school , if it's done silently and not teacher-led . That's the way it should be , in my opinion .

If you're OK with teacher-led prayer in public schools , is that only because you assume it's going to be Christian ? Or would you be bothered if it was a teacher-led Muslim prayer ? Or Hindu prayer ? Or Wiccan ? Granted , in private schools , children can pray out loud and have it be teacher-led . So , if you want your kid to be able to experience teacher-led prayer , send them to private school ... As it stands now , no one is barring kids from praying silently in class , to themselves .

If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same .

9525	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

9605	fatpeoplehate	Lol . You know . I once read a novel that had an Amazonian sort of tribe society of women living in pre-technology times . In the novel , the women believed that all women just naturally become pregnant at set intervals in their lives , they ' ripen like fruit ' . To them , it had nothing to do with the fact that they had sex with their male slaves , which in their eyes was just an outlet for pleasure . It would have been unthinkable to imagine that they needed the men for anything . A traveling doctor from another , more advanced , part of the world stumbled onto the tribe and tried to explain it to them . They stoned him . I think hammies have that same disconnect with reality . They want the world to be framed a certain way , so that's all there is to it . Even when it doesn't jive with other beliefs they've made up .

9799	uncensorednews	In response to your ninja edit : All examples of the Old Testament , which is very much a book of history . The verses from Judges and from Deuteronomy are recounting events that occurred---they are not commands . Notice how in every one of those instances NOWHERE is anyone commanded to do these things in perpetuity . In other words , verses like these are records of events that already occurred . Unlike in Islam , they are NOT generalized commands applicable anywhere , at any time , with no expiration . You'll notice that even in the verse in Exodus where the command is from God , it has a specific target and place listed . Once that threat was eliminated , the command was thus no longer applicable . Its very specific nature prevents it from being confused as a command which is to be extended forever and always . These Old Testament verses , and many like them , recount specific events that occurred . The few ones which were commands had a specific time and place and more importantly , very clearly ended . They were applicable to that specific situation in time and are clearly delineated as so in the text . Now compare that with the Koran's generalized commands to kill unbelievers ( all non Muslims ) everywhere , forever . See the difference ? Additionally , Christians no longer live by the Old Testament . We use it as a History book and as a book which pointed to the coming of Jesus Christ . If you want to use verses to compare with Islam , use the New Testament . Additionally , you're missing the forest for the trees when you ignore the reality that in Islam , the Muslims are the executors of Allah's wrath whereas in Christianity , God is the judge and Christians are only His messengers . I hope you can see the very clear differences at least between Islam and Christianity .	EXP

10254	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

10287	uncensorednews	"Comparing <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> is a stretch . The developmental stage and milestones of a <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> year old are worlds away . Really quick I'm going to explain something I learned in genetics when I was going to school to become a nurse . There is a difference between a baby's sex and his or her gender . Breasts and ovaries do not necessarily make your chromosomes XX . There are women around you every single day who look exactly like women but actually have XY chromosomes . This is due to happenings in the womb that cause them to never develop testicles and penis . All fetuses start out with the pieces and parts that are female . Playing and mirroring your funny shoes is not an indication of gender dysphoria . Because right now he is playing . The heels don't mean anything to him . They are not a symbol of femininity to him . Just weird shoes . But if he gets to be <NUMBER> years old and only ever wants to wear women's clothing ( and does it in secret because he knows it's something you disapprove of ) or is depressed when you put him with other boys in contact sports , you may have a huge red flag on your hands that his consciousness , gender , and self identity aren't matching with his sex . There is no treatment for gender dysphoria that will cure it , because therapy is about dealing with the depression , sadness , and anxiety of being different and feeling like a stranger in your own body . I know it's not what every mother hopes for , but in the event that your kid ever does have gender dysmorphia , you need to consider how best to help him . Hormone therapy before puberty won't permanently damage him , as he can end up going through male puberty anyway if he stops taking those meds . If you do have a kid that is trans , are you going to help him or her fit in with their chosen gender ? Or would you rather have a kid like the woman in the article who is so unhappy with her physical self that the only way she copes is by saying she is "" both . "" Even trans kids pick one gender without trying to be both . The woman in this article is going out of her way to be both at the same time . And she is foisting that genderless identity on her infant . I think it's wrong to do that . Because rather than focusing on what is physical , it is your personality that counts . This woman took it so far that she puts her body in a constant state of bothness / flux to keep female and have male attributes . I am afraid of what she will do to this infant , if she ends up thinking something dangerous like "" you can't pick your gender until you have been both . "" That is the same argument people use when they say "" how do you know you are not gay if you have never tried it ? "" Because deep down you know . Just like deep down you know if you are a girl or a boy . Even if that means you don't physically look like one . You can be trans without trying to change your physical appearance . But I have only ever seen very loving and open households produce kids like that . Only when boys are allowed to embrace their feminine side and are given strong male and female role models . But yeah . At the end of the day , it's what's inside that counts . But if it is important to the kid to physically match , then I think you should support him / her . It's just one of those things you figure out if you really love them and pray on it . The kid isn't trying to hurt you or him / herself . It's easier not to be different , so ..."	EXP

10953	fatpeoplehate	The US in general . It's an interesting question to ask . Fast food still hasn't caught on as much in Europe as in the US . Sure you have the odd McDs or Burger Kings around but in no way as ubiquitous as in the US . Even today , döner kebabs freshly made with a freshly baked pita bread is the go-to thing to eat when you are drunk or after a party or just for dinner when you don't want to cook . Still waaay healthier than anything a fast food joint can rustle up . The French don't like fast food much either , and forget about the Swiss . Weirdly , CZ , SL , PL have more US fast food places than the above mentioned countries . One thing I can think of is that Europe and Asia have a strong culinary tradition in every country . But when we think of something that is typically American in terms of food , we always think of hamburgers , buffalo wings , hot dogs , soda etc . So I dunno if there are hamplanets because there's so much shitty food or vice versa or its just a vicious cycle	EXP

11102	pics	"few facts , rather than quoting unnecessarily and extensively Granted from wikipedia , but the article is accurate , well-sourced and conservative . I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

11345	uncensorednews	"If Rich had been able to step forward and let everyone know that he was WikiLeaks ’ source and not Russia , the American people would never consent to these potentially world-ending escalations with a nuclear superpower , and America ’ s deep state would lose geopolitical power and influence . it appears that Rich was killed because he was the DNC leaker and not as a means to shape the ' muh Russia ' narrative . Although , It has become increasingly important for them to bang this pot to deflect why Rich may have been murdered and to forward the war hawking against Russia . If you're not familiar with the story here's a very brief update : Rich is alleged to be the DNC leaker . Assange has stated that no State actor is the leaker and alluded several times that Rich was the leaker . Rich was murdered shortly before Wikileaks published the leaked data showing that Sanders was railroaded by the DNC . The murder was called a ' robbery ' ( to deflect the real reason he was killed ? ) . None of Rich's thousands of dollars worth of person effects were stolen . After the DNC data was published , the DNC claimed they were ' hacked ' , denied the FBI access to investigate several times at multiple levels of requests by the FBI . The DNC brought in a private cybersecurity firm that has a penchant for attributing breaches to "" muh Russia "" that have later been found to be false . The private firm finds that the DNC was hacked by "" muh Russia "" .

11549	uncensorednews	"This was something I was looking into a while ago . Like you I found it difficult to find what I would consider a simple answer - after browsing a variety of sources I believe a simple answer doesn't exist because "" climate change "" itself is not a simple , directly measurable variable . We can track metrics such as surface temperature , carbon ppm , rainfall , etc . , but apart these metrics do not fully encapsulate the concept of a changing global climate and it doesn't appear there's yet a consensus on how to combine them to form a performance indicator that reliably reports "" climate change "" . With this in mind , I found it easier to find information on what seem to be the human contributions to what are hypothesized to be the sources of climate change . Take a moment to consider why this is an important difference . Anyway , the metric that stuck most in my mind - and I wish I could remember the source - was an estimation that since the industrial revolution the annual output of global carbon sources had increased by <NUMBER> % . I have not found an estimation of any change to the global carbon sink rate . So from this , the layman conclusions I would draw are that more carbon is entering the global carbon cycle every year than in pre-industrial human history . And since underground petroleum deposits represent an enormous amount of carbon that was previously sequestered from the carbon cycle - the worldwide human extraction and emission of this carbon seems a likely significant source of the introduction of additional carbon into the carbon cycle . We would need to know how the carbon sink rate has changed to gauge the actual compounded increase of carbon into the carbon cycle every year . It seems safe to assume that , at the very least , it has not kept up with source output given the easily tracked metric of carbon in the atmosphere . However , from there one would need to accurately model how atmospheric carbon affects "" climate "" or perhaps more specifically global temperatures . And this is the point I have not found a consensus on accurate forward modeling , other than more carbon dioxide generally means higher temperatures . Just FWIW my personal opinion is that humans are contributing to climate change but most government involvement gives negative returns and is more about politics than action . My relatively uneducated opinion is that all government efforts into mitigating climate change should go towards funding research into improving alternative energy sources , rather than artificially restricting people's access to energy or subsidizing vastly inferior sources of energy ."

11558	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself .

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers .

If you are , then you're golden . Yes there are hills . There are routes so that you can avoid the worst of the hills for either lights or rain . If all else fails , there's a great bus system in place . I'm still pretty much a fair weather rider , but I've been out a bunch of times since I got my endorsement last month . Even several times this week . I got rained on once , but I have waterproof gear , so I didn't care , other than being my first time in the rain . The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists . At least I haven't noticed a problem yet . But even when driving I like Seattle drivers . However , we moved from NC three years ago where you need to develop a sixth sense against the idiocy of driving there . So anywhere seems tame and normal after that for <NUMBER> years . People use turn signals here to indicate a turn . Other drivers see that and respect it . There are far fewer tailgaters here . The pace is generally much much slower , about the speed limit rather than <NUMBER> mph above it . The roads are noisier , though . There are quite a few Seattleites over on / r / motorcycles . So you can pose your question there and get a much more rider centric view on it . I haven't ridden anywhere else , but I like riding here . So much to see and do , fun roads and straight roads , highways and country roads . My husband likes to drive up to the mountains , turn around and come home .	NOT
