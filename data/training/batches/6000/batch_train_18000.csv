Maybe if he's complaining about being fat / people giving him looks based on his weight , he wants to change . Invite him to work out with you maybe and teach him how to eat .

The problem is the religion , plain and simple . Polls have shown that a majority of Muslims in the world find suicide bombing civilian targets in ' defense of Islam ' is perfectly acceptable . Last I checked <NUMBER> % of Muslims in the UK either hate gays or are against gay rights . It's a religion completely incompatible with western culture . Leave them in their shithole countries , which are shitholes because they're completely run by Muslims , and let them sort it out . I don't understand why people want to import a shithole religion ingrained in a shithole culture from a shithole country . It baffles me .	EXP

157	milliondollarextreme	"You seem to be defining "" product of a culture "" in an entirely tautological way no but things like political constructs , school systems , sciences - yeah they are totally <NUMBER> % products of culture . you're going to be hard pressed to find someone who matters and doesn't believe that something like the concept of democracy wasn't a product of greek culture . Are video games a "" product of Japanese culture "" in some important sense ? What does that imply for whether or not people of other cultures can enjoy video games ? video games in general ? no , but you're asking a way too generalized question that you know can't be answered affirmatively . the way you're framing that question is basically cheating . japan didn't invent video games . pong wasn't japanese , and neither were the odyssey , the atari <NUMBER> , or most old ( pre-nintendo ) arcade games . nintendo just happened to be in the right place at the right time to spring into huge success with the NES ( and japanese Famicom ) and dominate the game market after it had kind of collapsed just before . but were the games made in japan products of japanese culture ? hell yes they were . plot twist - part of that culture includes that some time after WW2 they started retooling their society to find a new place in the world and focusing on exports . so a lot of those games were made to appeal to americans , and traditional japanese influences may be less seen in those , but that was still part of their culture - absorbing outside influences and exploiting them for profit . they had been learning english as a second language in schools to an extent that a lot of early nintendo games , even the japanese releases had english in them . that's part of their culture now , absorbing ( and some would say perverting ) american culture . and a lot of early nintendo games definitely do exhibit that wacky japanese style . they often americanized games before releasing them here , by translating them and maybe even changing characters to match american archetypes , but a lot of times you can still see very japanese things that slipped through in the american release . i'm saying this as a guy who loaded and played with ( at least briefly ) , about every rom ( excepting duplicates ) in a complete GoodNES romset about 15yrs ago . i'm focusing on the 80s / NES era there because i think nowadays the influences have been so cross-pollinated that it's usually a lot harder to judge . was skyrim influenced by ' J-RPGs ' ? almost surely on some level , but how much is hard to say . ( old ) J-RPGs were influenced by D & D and Ultima ( and those by tolkien ) too though . and now with the internet anyone in a field like that can look around the world and be influenced by anything . not to say that nintendo wasn't already influenced by western games when they started out . donkey kong was very much in the style of what was already out there , while still somewhat unique . ( i've already said this but ) i feel that almost anything is going to be influenced / shaped by culture , or cultures , and that's inescapable . the person ( s ) who made it grew up absorbing a culture ( or cultures ) and was influenced by it ( or them ) . i don't see how anyone could think differently . but you can't just make a blanket statement , you have to look closer at the specific product , and then you can see that there may be bits of ideas borrowed from some other culture in that product or thing . trade routes cross pollinated cultures with foreign ideas . your problem is you're being too black or white . example - saying ' jazz has some white people now so it's not a product of black culture ' . you can't throw out the baby with the bath water like that . it has some of both . probably in one sense mostly black , but a lot of those blacks went to juilliard - a very white-centric music school and were taught euro-centric music theory there , and were playing on instruments developed in white cultures , and that definitely DOES have heavy influence over what they went on to play . also it depends on what specific jazz you're looking at , because ' jazz ' describes a huge range of styles . even rap / hip hop has lots of white cultural influence in it ( especially when the biggest consumers are white kids , so if you want your hip hop to be popular , just like any other product , you have to consider the consumer , right ? ) . otherwise it would sound more like traditional african music . inescapable fact is that blacks born and raised in america , away from their land of origin , have been heavily influenced by white people . they have sub-cultures for sure . but any specific idea that exists , you can look at it and trace roots . nobody invents something out of thin air ( i dunno , maybe with a few historical exceptions ? ) . Why did Europeans figure out classical mechanics and the periodic table and the Chinese never did ? Whatever your answer is , does that mean that the Chinese will never be able to become as scientific as Europeans are ? because somebody had to be the first ? china was in a lot of turmoil in the early 1900s , and pretty far behind the western world until probably very recently when american politicians did them a huge favor by helping them steal the american industry . we live in a pretty connected world now where ideas can be shared instantly so i'm pretty sure they have a table of elements by now . and have for a while . not sure what point you're trying to make here . It's ironic because this paragraph is a bunch of vague , abstract accusations not supported by examples and imo mischaracterizations of anything i've said so i don't feel like replying to them unless you want to actually get specific . Remember that what I am saying is that if we bring in only skilled immigrants at a rate which lets them assimilate , white people could become a minority and we could still have more or less the same American culture . Explain why that isn't true . because the hypothetical scenario is total bullshit . the idea that we bring in that many people and they all totally assimilate and absorb and reflect ' american culture ' is never going to happen . it's not how immigration has ever worked and it never will work that way . there are still chinatowns all across the country . wtf u smoking . i mean , unless your idea of being a part of ' american culture ' is ' be whatever you want , stick to yourselves , get on welfare ' like plenty of muslims are doing . then yeah ok they're totally <NUMBER> % americans , legit grade A"	EXP

160	milliondollarextreme	The key aspect of a narcissist's psychology is that they cling tenaciously to some constructed self-image which is separate from their actual self . In this way they can protect their actual selves which are often fragile due to some trauma earlier in life - - this is where self-hatred can enter the picture . A narcissist seeks out sources of narcissistic supply , i . e . some sort of feedback that bolsters their false image . For this reason many insults which would greatly impact others leave narcissists unphased . However , in response to attacks on their constructed self-image ( called narcissistic injuries ) they will fly into a rage . Note that this is a Freudian conception of narcissism .

583	fatpeoplehate	Growing up both parents were obese , younger sister was very overweight . Whem my sis graduated high school my parents announced they were spliting up .

My father dropped close to <NUMBER> pounds when he broke my mothers orbit . Landed himself a <NUMBER> year old new wife and a much longer life expectancy !

595	OperationPullRyan	Statement by the President on H . R . <NUMBER> : Today I have signed into law H . R . <NUMBER> , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <NUMBER> . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over <NUMBER> pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section <NUMBER> affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> U . S . C . <NUMBER> note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the <NUMBER> AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section <NUMBER> confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section <NUMBER> ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section <NUMBER> ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the <NUMBER> AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section <NUMBER> seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section <NUMBER> is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section <NUMBER> provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section <NUMBER> provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past <NUMBER> years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

As I said in my other comment , religion is so much more than that . It exists on a deep , personal , spiritual level that no one , not you , not I , not extremist preachers , get to define . The Islam of people like Malala Yousafzai is as far removed from that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as our own , secular ideologies are , perhaps even more so . Reducing an incredible important part of people's lives to something base and evil is quite frankly insulting to those people , not to mention extremely alienating .

Although , It has become increasingly important for them to bang this pot to deflect why Rich may have been murdered and to forward the war hawking against Russia . If you're not familiar with the story here's a very brief update : Rich is alleged to be the DNC leaker . Assange has stated that no State actor is the leaker and alluded several times that Rich was the leaker . Rich was murdered shortly before Wikileaks published the leaked data showing that Sanders was railroaded by the DNC . The murder was called a ' robbery ' ( to deflect the real reason he was killed ? ) . None of Rich's thousands of dollars worth of person effects were stolen . After the DNC data was published , the DNC claimed they were ' hacked ' , denied the FBI access to investigate several times at multiple levels of requests by the FBI . The DNC brought in a private cybersecurity firm that has a penchant for attributing breaches to "" muh Russia "" that have later been found to be false . The private firm finds that the DNC was hacked by "" muh Russia "" . [ If you want a in depth analysis then you can watch this . ] ( <URL> It is + <NUMBER> minutes , but provides verifiable links to information . Personally , I've been loosely following the story .

889	uncensorednews	This is the blm I see on the news . The blm I have experienced is very different .

For example , I went to a blm speech event and one professor spoke of how real estate is being racially skewed by putting people of one color in one area . No loud outbursts happened during his lecture , no blocking highways , and everyone got to ask questions . Everything was answered , everyone included . Even racism against whites was covered . The only problem was he didn't have a solution . I don't think anyone does . When a cop shoots a child , how do you make him realize his mistake ? When a cop shoots an unarmed man with his hands in the air with no charges on him , how do you make that not happen again ? I believe a reform is necessary . From the ground up . Most police officers I know are power hungry with a god complex so I try not to get involved with them . I would rather police only handle small but dangerous altercations and leave the psychological problems to the psychiatrists , and every other problem to the people that have been trained for that .

A report by the Washinon Post which can be read here ; <URL> Statistics , however , suggest that the gun bans alone did not have an immediate impact on firearm-related crime . Over time , however , gun violence in virtually all its guises has significantly come down with the aid of stricter enforcement and waves of police anti-weapons operations . The most current statistics available show that firearms were used to kill <NUMBER> people in all of England and Wales in <NUMBER> , compared with <NUMBER> such homicides that same year in Washinon , D .

Britain has seen one mass shooting since its most onerous gun ban went through in <NUMBER> , with criminologists arguing that a <NUMBER> rampage in the British countryside could have been worse had the perpetrator had access to stronger firepower . Today , law enforcement officials say ballistic tests indicate that most gun crime in Britain can be traced back to fewer than <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> illegal weapons still in circulation . As an example of how having access to better guns would have made things worse . But starting in <NUMBER> — and following years of anti-gun sweeps by police forces in British cities that made illegal guns far less accessible — gun violence began to ebb . In <NUMBER> , England and Wales recorded <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> offenses involving firearms , down <NUMBER> percent from their peak in <NUMBER> . Given that British crime statistics also count fake guns as “ firearms , ” criminologists say the number of violent crimes involving real guns is likely significantly lower . <URL> Shows that it is still .. bar large cities almost negligible .

If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

What they've studied their entire life to do ? They want to get to the truth of it . They use a litany of statistical tests to try to nullify as many biases as they can . But no . your source , one policeman on a rant . Is better than the whole literature combined that's been meta-analyized and contextualised and studied . Also , please don't call a rant a statistic .

Or causes increased crime rates . Or reduces the standard of living . Or is a risk to take on . There has been multiple analyses , cross sections and reviews done of the overall impact that I have cited again and again . While not as explosive or as provoking as this one tragic incident , it is however more indicative . Of course I am not saying that no one is to blame or that it is completely risk free to allow refugees to seek asylum . However , this is one of the biggest moral challenges in our ever growing , ever globalizing world . And we're going to have to look at our children in the face and tell them what we did , what we thought , when millions of people seeking freedom from death , rape , famine , terror came to our doorsteps . I hope we don't have to look at them in the eye and tell them : "" Im sorry . We thought we were doing the right thing . "" Because I know you and everyone else like you are not stupid . Not irrational . You truly believe that this is what's best for European countries and ours too probably . But that isn't true . And if you look outside your own political bubble you'll find evidence for it too . So please look . Just a little bit harder . It'll make the world just that much better if we afforded the sympathy we have for our neighbours to the faceless millions who can't afford a future .

Have you ever been drunk ? Just a question . Yes , actually , I have been blackout drunk before . There's a reason I don't drink anymore . And , as is right , I take full responsibility for all of my actions while drunk .  ... and consent is massively abrogated in a drunken context . No , judgement is impaired , but not consent . We don't allow sober people with poor judgement to claim rape when anybody has sex with them , why does this suddenly magically change with drunk sex ? "" I was being stupid . "" is not a valid excuse for doing something stupid . No . Contract law is quite relevant ... You engage in a contract whenever you agree to do something with another person .

The mayor of Ferguson just asked for the FBI to step in bc the local police can't contain the mainly african murican murder rate / rape rate . Nor am I arguing race and violence . that's why arguing with leftists is futile . Bc they deny demography is destiny if critical mass is reached . This is likely caused by the socioeconomic gap between the average white and black in America . and asian muricans are HIGHLY overrepresented in lower income groups in using medicaid / social services bc they be poor as shit too ( not all of them are rich mainland Chinese too ) . Yet China towns all across Murica with their poverty stricken low income housing aren't commiting a disproportionate % of violence so ur explaination of socieoeconomic gap goes out the window U said this : Like I said , I am not arguing race to violence . It is statistically proven that African Americans commit more crimes in America . . I am glad you brought up the UK and Sweden . USA per capita murder rate : <NUMBER> UK : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Sweden : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Australia : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> And I told u to break it down by racial demographics and u'll find that asians in murica will have a similiar violence ( like felony rape ) rate to asians in UK , Sweden and Asian while whites will have a similiar racial demographic in Europe and blacks in Murica will have a similiar violence rates to blacks in UK , Sweden and african countries just like brown caucasoid muslims will have similar rates of violence whether in the middle east or Europe . Demography is destiny , like Freud says . The overepresentation of certain "" oppressed "" minority groups skews the murder rate . Show us the murder rate asian muricans vs white muricans vs black muricans vs hispanic muricans vs asians , whites , blacks , hispanics in these same countries which u won't do . <URL> Extending on an analysis by the academic Kieran Healy , I calculated the rate of U .

By comparison , the rate of homicide deaths among non-Hispanic black Americans is <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> per <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> persons , or about <NUMBER> in <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> people per year . . So for white Americans , the homicide death rate is not so much of an outlier . It ’ s only modestly higher than in Finland , Belgium or Greece , for instance , and lower than in Chile or Latvia . . Their homicide death rate , <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> per <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> persons , is about <NUMBER> times higher than the average rate among all people <NUMBER> in other developed countries .

Why is the average in parts of the country , where asians / whites are the majority of the area don't ' get by far the most crime ? I love how u leftists describe how crime is passive thing . Or how schools or neighborhoods "" turn "" bad . Bc u too gutless to point out the trend of the protected minority groups overrepresented in doing these bad things , so u want to limit everyone's rights . Oh , and you haven't been able to explain Alaska away ; Alaska is a Republican DREAM . don't have the time yet to research , love how u focus on Alaska whern like <NUMBER> of the top ten gun murder rates states contain significant pop . % of african muricans . And doesn't Nevade have a tipping point of hispanic % ? Did u know that FBI has a hispanic victim category , but when a hispanic is a perpatrator in a murder / rape / assault , FBI classifies him as "" white "" ? Like I said , I'm no fan of white people , but lumping in mextizo and amerindian rapists / murderers ( and also Middle easterners / N.africans/arabs as "" white "" would spike up the "" white "" murder rate hmmm ? We should do the top <NUMBER> lowest gun murder rates states , no counties and look at racial demographics . Oppression ? Trump is the guy that has a beef with the first amendment . Leftists are such liars and disingenuous lol Leftists in the obama admin for the last <NUMBER> years were the biggest opponents of the first admendment . leftists also support the socialist welfare state and the mass survelliance state lol . the counties which hold nearly half of the population of the USA have the most crime ? Wow . Insane cripes nice way to deflect ur willing to talk about racial demographics in relation to violence ok i see u use to be alt right . Here is a politically correct link where murder rates are not linked with racial demographics : "" Murders in US very concentrated : <NUMBER> % of US counties in <NUMBER> had zero murders , <NUMBER> % of counties have <NUMBER> % of the murders "" <URL> And here is one where the alt right links . "" New Study : US Murders Concentrated in Nonwhite Counties "" <URL> Sixty-eight percent of all murders in the U . S . occur in just <NUMBER> percent of counties — all of them concentrated in nonwhite-inhabited regions , a new study by the Crime Prevention Research Center has shown . The report , titled “ The Geographical Concentration of Murders , ” is careful to avoid mentioning race , but the maps and data provided show clearly the relationship between race and the murder rate . Murders are concentrated in the areas heavily overrun by the Hispanic invasion , and in the urban areas where blacks are concentrated . “ The United States can really be divided up into three types of places . Places where there are no murders , places where there are a few murders , and places where murders are very common , ” the report continues . It goes on to point out that “ most counties [ in the U . S . ] don ’ t experience any murders , ” and that in <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> percent of U . S . counties had zero murders , and <NUMBER> percent had no more than one murder . Sixty-nine percent of counties have no more than one murder , and about <NUMBER> percent of the population . These counties account for only <NUMBER> percent of all murders in the country . The worst <NUMBER> percent of counties have <NUMBER> percent of the population and <NUMBER> percent of the murders . The worst <NUMBER> percent of counties contain <NUMBER> percent of the population and account for <NUMBER> percent of murders . The <NUMBER> U . S . murder rate was <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> per <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> people , the report continues , adding that when the worst <NUMBER> percent of counties are excluded from this total , the national murder rate drops to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> per <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> people . “ If the worst <NUMBER> percent of counties are removed , the U . S . murder rate would be <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> per <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , ” the report says . Again , don't oppress my 2nd amendment right to own a gun if other racial demographics choose to engage in dysfunctional behaviors and wildly disproportionate murder rates . You sound like those leftwing nutjobs in Europe who talk about banning trucks and knives bc radical muslims are disproportionately using trucks / knives to carry out terrorist attacks . am not saying that we should ban all guns . I am only saying that we need to make sure that criminals do not get guns , How about banning trucks and knives since a disproportionate number of trucks / knives are being used to murder people hmm ? l ol or we could just do what ex <NUMBER> term mayor of NYC ( where african muricans make up <NUMBER> % of pop . , hispanics make up <NUMBER> % of pop . ( dat's over the tipping point eh ? ) and media mogul / billionaire Mike Bloomberg suggested : "" Bloomberg Suggests Banning Young Minority Males from Gun Ownership "" <URL> he discussed guns . The Times reported that he said , “ Cities need to get guns out of [ the ] … hands ” of persons who are “ male , minority , and between the ages of <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> . ” He claimed that “ <NUMBER> percent of all murders fall into this category ” and that taking guns away from them will not only reduce crime , but will “ keep them alive . ”"	EXP

1683	uncensorednews	"There's a lot that can happen . The political unrest is fairly large as is and considering that the terror attacks will likely not cease any time soon , especially with another million projected invaders on the way , it's difficult to describe the potential but inevitable misery that will unfold . Look at other European nations . You saw things like Brexit occur . You've got France next in line . We saw Hungary erect a wall around their nation after Cologne and it worked so well that now they want to build a second wall . It's hard to say just how a larger block of German natives will protest what's happening as the months go by . Like I said , it's not just a matter of what these people are doing , that they've contributed virtually nothing but criminal behavior but that the German people essentially have to pay for it . I can't safely make a statement along the lines of , "" Open civil war . Europe in flames . "" But there's next to no denying there will be significant conflict . The implied conflict also comes simply through the evolutionary strategy of the invaders themselves , given they have many more children than the natives ( which the natives will be paying for ) and that second and third generation immigrants are more likely to radicalize . These people already express a clear contempt for their hosts , guess what they're going to teach their offspring to do ? Again , I can't accurately predict everything that will happen in the next twenty , fifty or one hundred years for Germany , especially after what I mentioned above but if I were to compare what countries like Germany do in response to things like Cologne or terror attacks , which is to outright deny or censor them while insisting more foreign hostility upon its populace , to what Hungary does , which is reaffirm their own borders and protect their native people , I can safely affirm one certainty for Germany - Chaos .

1994	milliondollarextreme	I'm on the same boat . I was beyond annoyed with the Pickle Rick shit , but the episode was shockingly good . Plus the therapy bits were a really good way to counter the nihilism that the show gets soaked in sometimes . It was nice seeing the show establish that the main reason why Rick is so black pilled is just because that's his way of escaping his real feelings . I'm interested in where the show goes and I ultimately hope the whole country-wide annoyance towards Pickle Rick memes will make that fandom calm the fuck down a little bit . Maybe they'll realize they're watching a show on a network for <NUMBER> - something stoners , and that having a small amount of wit doesn't make you the smartest screenwriter on television .

I do remember she was wearing jeans , though , and I wondered where on earth she had found ones that at least sort-of fit her , because her proportions were so far from anything sold in any plus-size store .

2060	uncensorednews	""" hundreds of years "" . Is it hundreds of years ? And isn't SA far , far better off than any other African nation ? So is it not more accurate to qualify the racist hatered as jealousy and malice ? Because blacks did well in a country run by whites . True they were barred from political influence and one can understand why they would hold resentment . The fact remains when comparing SA to other african nations that they benefit greatly from having had and still having whites living and working in their country . So is it not more accurate to qualify their racism as eny of white people ? When they took away land from white farmers they starved . If blacks would rule the world today what do you think would happen to whites ? People always rationalise their beliefs . They rationalise racism . And racism works less in individual people , instead it opperates more within groups of people . I think it is important to understand how it functions , because especialy today in mainstream and very leftist culture one gets the impression that only whites are even capable of racism . That is a dangerous ideology . The ideal system respects the freedom of the individual and does not discriminate on race , a meritocracy . The dilemma is in this system blacks lose on average . Edged on by political interest groups this creates resentment . Is there a solution ? In fact taxes on the created wealth then benefit those less successful . That is the concept of a society . Someone building a company and creating wealth benefit others , not just themselves . But the resentment , the jealousy and the malice towards the successful stays . How does one combat this ? It is especialy difficult as throughout history the powerful abused their power and exploited others . So the feeling is not without an element of truth . And still today international financial interests and corporations are gaming the system . I heard that in the past <NUMBER> years <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> whites were murdered in SA . Is this accurate ? It is gangs of blacks who predominantly attack white farmers , steal their wealth , brutaly rape the women and then murder them . Economical and racist resentment fuels this .

2256	uncensorednews	"Okay , I'm interested , I've never had the opportunity to actually have any kind of actual _discussion_ with a white nationalist . I'm interested in your side of things but you do have to admit , a lot of white nationalist types are dickheads . I disagree with a lot of what you have said , but I'd still like to keep it civil and listen to you , so here we go . Do you really want every threads comments being brigading SJW's and muslims and communists subverting the comment section into a circle jerk while they invade and destroy our societies ? no fucking thanks . SJW subversion - possible , Communist subversion - Not a thing . There aren't enough actual communists _left_ to subvert anything . Maybe you mean democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders supporters ? If so , then that is a far cry from actual communism , if not I'm interested to know what you mean by this - perhaps you know something I don't ? Seriously .. A white nationalist is exactly what can create the most unbiased sub ( ... ) I disagree with this . Try to look at this from a moderate's persective : Instead of having leftwing nutjobs censoring things , now we have rightwing nutjobs censoring things . Instead of having a nuetral party you have two separate parties that are wildly opposed , no one is going to get the whole story because both sides of the coin are prone to censorship and ignoring the facts . There are people on here WHO HATE the west and will subvert and destroy ANY meaningful conversation about issues INVOLVING THEM ... I'd like to hear more of what you mean by this , I interpret ' enemies ' to mean foreign extremists but I could also interpret your comment to mean minorities in general ? . I do agree that the west definitely has enemies and that undoubtedly some of them must be on reddit in some capacity but I do not believe they are intentionally subverting discussion . However I will cede that this is an impossible front to argue on from either side , neither of us will ever have evidence that this is true or not because neither of us are doing it . You are not Allowed to talk about Jews ( ... ) You are allowed to talk about Jews - you just aren't allowed to call them racially inferior , or make wild speculations like the typical "" Jews are secretly running it all "" Illuminati stuff because there is no actual causative evidence of this . You are not Allowed to talk about MUSLIMS ( ... ) I do agree with this , I think society as a whole is sort of trying to figure out just how far they should go for "" equality "" . It was easy when it just meant giving black people all the freedoms white people had , but it's much harder for religions - especially religions grounded in more old fashion ideals . This isn't exclusive to Muslims though , every year you see news stories about stupid asshole Hasidic Jews who wont sit next to women on planes or wackjob Christians who picket funerals or try to burn down gay people's houses . I don't think it's an inherently ' Muslim ' issue , I think it's an inherently ' backwards asshole ' issue . Unfortunately Muslims tend to be more socially backwards for some reason or another , but it is still unfair to call out _all_ Muslims for the actions of extremists , however many there may be . You are not Allowed to talk about BLACKS You _are_ allowed to talk about blacks , you just aren't allowed to call them racially inferior because there is no reliable scientific evidence that says they are . However I think it's okay to have problems with ' black culture ' in America , but discarding them and their culture as "" inferior "" is just as stupid as when the Germans did it to the Jews ( and everyone else really ) . If you LOVE the west and want to be part of this great society , then who better to run that than a white nationalist ? THEY CREATED THE CULTURE YOU LIKE OR WANT TO BE A PART OF . I don't think whites have created ' the best society ' . I think every society has it's good sides and bad sides and that every society has something we can learn from it . I don't think white nationalist should run our country because , like it or not , other ethnic groups are part of America and part of our history . Where would we be if not for France ? Where would we be if not for Chinese and Irish immigrant workers ? A lot further behind technologically , that's where . I respect the contributions and sacrifices of other races and believe we should give them the same respect you give to whites . American is NOT white only . GERMAN by name is ... I dont give a fuck how many black babies have been spitted out in Germany .. THEY WILL NEVER BE GERMAN ... See this is kind of a shaky argument , you're using ' American ' as in the nationality and ' German ' as in the race and I think that's an unfair representation . [ Germany actually has proportionally _more_ immigrants than the U . S . does ] ( <URL> and before you call me a nazi make me a native american and me say "" THEY WILL NEVER BE CHEROKEE "" I don't understand what you mean by this . I feel that when you start calling the opposition Nazis , that is when you have lost the argument . Ad hominem attacks on a persons character and beliefs are the lowest level of discussion and don't get anything anywhere . I'm not going to call you a Nazi unless you start talking about your support for Hitler's Germany , which I don't think you're very interested in . The migrant horde that is invading europe right now , WILL NEVER BE EUROPEAN This is the same misrepresentation of the German one : you're mixing race and nationality . Migrants can and do become culturally American / European , my family did it when they came to America from Ireland and odds are your family did too . Cultural diffusion does exist , it just doesn't happen overnight . Europe just has to decide whether it wants to wait the few generations it takes to normalize the immigrants that are coming in , or if it is morally acceptable to force people to stay in a war torn country because they don't want to deal with them . I'm very interested to hear your reply and I hope we can keep things civil . I may not be able to reply for a while because I have some real life things going on today and I wont have the time to really think about your words ."	EXP

2268	uncensorednews	Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder as defined by the DSM . In this case , the Afghan man likely experiences inclusive pedophilia which means he has an unemotional attraction to any prepubescent child . So he was probably waiting to be processed in this government immigration office and saw a young boy enter the bathroom alone . Him being messed up in the head , obviously followed the boy because he had a sudden sexual urge . The Afghan man pulls a knife on the kid and forces him to perform oral sex . The boy's father comes in and ask what the heck is happening , but the man says he's helping the kid go to the bathroom . The father is an idiot for believing it . So the Afghan man finishes his business and authorities only find out when the kid admits it later . Forced oral sex is still considered rape and it's terrible that a boy endured this . Prepubescent rape is considered easy to a rapist because the toddler can't defend themselves . The rapist just screwed up his chances of getting his asylum accepted and I'll be surprised if they let this slide .	EXP

2283	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

2341	europeannationalism	I am a National Socialist , and I'd be happy to explain what that means . National Socialism is a bit of a misnomer since it was used during a time Socialism could refer to any ideology that appeals to the interests of the workers , while not necessarily being a Pro-class struggle or Communist ideology . It would be more accurate to call National Socialism a Corporatist ideology . Like other forms of Fascism , National Socialism advocates for a system that protects private property and allows for a market economy , but the State promotes and ensures that there is class unity as opposed to class struggle , healthy class relations that are beneficial for all involved . NS is in favor of Nationalism and ethnocentrism . We believes that every nation's and every race's autonomy should be preserved . This doesn't mean every nation is isolated from each other , but National Socialism is against globalism and globalization . Foreigners are allowed to exist within a NS nation , but they have to respect the society they are in and follow the law of foreigners . The interests of the nation and society are held deeply . We advocate for a one-party meritocratic government that chooses and promotes leaders based on their competence and gives them accountability proportionate to the power they hold . National Socialism opposes the Liberal concept of democracy , but this does not mean we're against all forms of voting and other citizen participation in government . The Third Reich itself held multiple plebiscites and citizens were empowered to become involved in their communities . Society in general will be built around meritocracy . The amount of effort and good you produce will determine what you get from society . There will be incentives for people to improve their bodies , their minds , and their communities . There will be incentives for those who benefit their communities , and their nation directly or indirectly . These incentives will likely come in the form of access to additional social services and other benefits . Aside from that , there are many different interpretations of National Socialism . If you have any questions , feel free to ask me . I'll even suggest you some additional reading if you want more in-depth perspectives related to National Socialism . Let me know if you need more recommendations . Suggested Reading - Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler This is mostly a biographical look at Hitler's life and his political views , it's a long read and is in a conversational tone that may be hard to read . However , it may help you understand Adolf Hitler a little more . The Programme of the NSDAP by Gottfried Feder This is a good book for the actual politics of the NSDAP . It outlines the social , political , and economic foundation of National Socialism in Germany . I highly recommend it . White Power by George Lincoln Rockwell This is a good book for learning about Rockwell's post-war interpretation of National Socialism and is a decent introduction to the American strain of NS in general . National Socialism : Vanguard of the Future by Colin Jordan . This is another book written after World War II and the subsequent fall of the German Reich . It's a collection of several essays on the topic of Germany and National Socialism . Who We Are by William Luther Pierce Another good piece of literature on the topic of National Socialism , in general I'd recommend Pierce's work . He sometimes goes under the pen name Andrew Macdonald , so just be aware of that .	EXP

2523	uncensorednews	In response to your ninja edit : All examples of the Old Testament , which is very much a book of history . The verses from Judges and from Deuteronomy are recounting events that occurred---they are not commands . Notice how in every one of those instances NOWHERE is anyone commanded to do these things in perpetuity . In other words , verses like these are records of events that already occurred . Unlike in Islam , they are NOT generalized commands applicable anywhere , at any time , with no expiration . You'll notice that even in the verse in Exodus where the command is from God , it has a specific target and place listed . Once that threat was eliminated , the command was thus no longer applicable . Its very specific nature prevents it from being confused as a command which is to be extended forever and always . These Old Testament verses , and many like them , recount specific events that occurred . The few ones which were commands had a specific time and place and more importantly , very clearly ended . They were applicable to that specific situation in time and are clearly delineated as so in the text . Now compare that with the Koran's generalized commands to kill unbelievers ( all non Muslims ) everywhere , forever . See the difference ? Additionally , Christians no longer live by the Old Testament . We use it as a History book and as a book which pointed to the coming of Jesus Christ . If you want to use verses to compare with Islam , use the New Testament . Additionally , you're missing the forest for the trees when you ignore the reality that in Islam , the Muslims are the executors of Allah's wrath whereas in Christianity , God is the judge and Christians are only His messengers . I hope you can see the very clear differences at least between Islam and Christianity .	EXP

2649	gaming	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

There is no point in saying x is the limit for all , when not all people will use x calories in a day .

It stands though , if they are stupid and correct , then what the hell are you ? Clearly I was wrong earlier , you couldn't possibly be anywhere near medicine . If you are , thank goodness you are not involved in my health care system . The point of calorie restriction as a consistent ( at least for the majority of days ) process is where the benefits are reaped - obviously it is known that a positive energy balance creates fat gain and that is not healthy , so it is required that a healthy weight is maintained ... but there is not point in me saying all of this .

Ash sits down for about <NUMBER> minutes and when she gets up , she's fine for about the same amount of time . This continues through the night till about <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> in the morning where most of us are drunk , her and her boyfriend are quite sober by comparison but she wants to dance .

She ended up basically "" dancing "" in a pool of blood that was starting to form and we only noticed when I slipped on said blood and caught myself on on some guy .

3224	uncensorednews	"Comparing <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> is a stretch . The developmental stage and milestones of a <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> year old are worlds away . Really quick I'm going to explain something I learned in genetics when I was going to school to become a nurse . There is a difference between a baby's sex and his or her gender . Breasts and ovaries do not necessarily make your chromosomes XX . There are women around you every single day who look exactly like women but actually have XY chromosomes . This is due to happenings in the womb that cause them to never develop testicles and penis . All fetuses start out with the pieces and parts that are female . Playing and mirroring your funny shoes is not an indication of gender dysphoria . Because right now he is playing . The heels don't mean anything to him . They are not a symbol of femininity to him . Just weird shoes . But if he gets to be <NUMBER> years old and only ever wants to wear women's clothing ( and does it in secret because he knows it's something you disapprove of ) or is depressed when you put him with other boys in contact sports , you may have a huge red flag on your hands that his consciousness , gender , and self identity aren't matching with his sex . There is no treatment for gender dysphoria that will cure it , because therapy is about dealing with the depression , sadness , and anxiety of being different and feeling like a stranger in your own body . I know it's not what every mother hopes for , but in the event that your kid ever does have gender dysmorphia , you need to consider how best to help him . Hormone therapy before puberty won't permanently damage him , as he can end up going through male puberty anyway if he stops taking those meds . If you do have a kid that is trans , are you going to help him or her fit in with their chosen gender ? Or would you rather have a kid like the woman in the article who is so unhappy with her physical self that the only way she copes is by saying she is "" both . "" Even trans kids pick one gender without trying to be both . The woman in this article is going out of her way to be both at the same time . And she is foisting that genderless identity on her infant . I think it's wrong to do that . Because rather than focusing on what is physical , it is your personality that counts . This woman took it so far that she puts her body in a constant state of bothness / flux to keep female and have male attributes . I am afraid of what she will do to this infant , if she ends up thinking something dangerous like "" you can't pick your gender until you have been both . "" That is the same argument people use when they say "" how do you know you are not gay if you have never tried it ? "" Because deep down you know . Just like deep down you know if you are a girl or a boy . Even if that means you don't physically look like one . You can be trans without trying to change your physical appearance . But I have only ever seen very loving and open households produce kids like that . Only when boys are allowed to embrace their feminine side and are given strong male and female role models . But yeah . At the end of the day , it's what's inside that counts . But if it is important to the kid to physically match , then I think you should support him / her . It's just one of those things you figure out if you really love them and pray on it . The kid isn't trying to hurt you or him / herself . It's easier not to be different , so ..."	EXP

These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

3288	fatpeoplehate	I'm male , I will support equality of the sexes until the end of time , but like many other males , the vast majority of my experiences with feminism have been extremely negative . In college , I had the pleasure of meeting many of these fine ladies who were hands down some of the most horrid bitter , sexist people with victim complexes out the ass . I further made the mistake of attending two women's studies courses with stimulating lectures on why all males should be castrated , how men are the root of all societal evils , and how women cannot be sexist . Any sort of rational argument or statistic was dismissed immediately as a ' social construct . ' Words were redefined until they lost all meaning . Any attempt at presenting a differing viewpoint was met with abject hostility and insults . I've lost count of the number of times I've been called patriarch - - one of which was for the injustice of offering to carry the books of a girl who was limping around on crutches . It wasn't until I discovered reddit that I ran into feminists who I considered reasonable and actually seemed interested in equality . I feel bad for said feminists because what was once a great movement has been hijacked by lunatics . To those feminists on reddit , I ask how do you feel about this ? Do you ever wonder why so many males seem to have a complete aversion to feminism ? Either we're all raging misogynists , or there's something very wrong with feminism as a movement . I almost feel as if it should be abandoned and left to the vocal idiots while a new movement for women interested in actual women's issues and equality should be formed .	EXP

3308	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something .

3670	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks .

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

And just so you know , I get it , I used to be like you when I was your age , I wanted to be a Nazi because I wanted to be counter-cultural and being a Nazi just seemed like the most counter-cultural thing you could be . I called myself a Nazi unironically , I played dress-up Nazi , I did the salutes and said Heil Hitler , and like you I'd imagine , I retained all the Liberal beliefs I'd been raised with such as equality , tolerance and so on and I'd always say to people "" I'm a Nazi because I like Hitlers ideas but I don't agree with hating Jews .

The situation was cause for thought for me and I thought it was cause for thought for others allowing an interesting discussion to open up . I'm unsure about your advice to : Instead of telling your friends to completely stop , you could have just as easily used what your friends were doing to give value to the entire restaurant . You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people . Perhaps I need to clarify , but the example I use in my article is happening in a sushi restaurant . It irritated me that my friends were acting out in a classy establishment . I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance , but in any case , it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person , in fact , part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values .

All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang . Not to mention the model of abiogenesis has to account for starting evolution , ie the first organism would have to be capable of reproducing and evolving . edit : grammar"	NOT

Firing Comey was on the lips of liberals for months , right up until Trump went through with it . Let's not pretend otherwise . How does a press conference off camera in any way delegitimize it ? Did you know he also gave press credentials to dozens of new organizations as well as opened up the press conferences to video calls from small local companies ? Far more than Obama ever did . Yeah he could be golfing less , nothing to do with transparency though . The taxes are really a non issue , to me at least . There's no law requiring it and if he was trying to hide anything in them Mueller would've found it by now . Bannon is his primary advisor , Ivanka is hardly involved and Kushner is in over his head , he should probably go . You're blowing up their roles way out of proportion though . Having to play his cards close to his chest had a lot more to do with the media vendetta than his own issues .

4340	IWantToLearn	"^ Excellent intro to philosophy . Also If you want to go chronologically , For Western Philosophy : look into the pre socratics then Aristotle and Plato Augustine Berkely , Locke , Hume Hobbes Heidegger Kant Hegel Nietsche - - read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus ' The Orestia , Sophocles ' Oedipus Cycle , and Euripides the Bacchae . Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

He said yes , but he had to share his McDonald's french fries with his siblings for dinner and he was still hungry . Literally the children shared McDonald's fries for dinner .. his parents were not the nicest people ever , and I felt so bad for the poor kid and his siblings . I wanted so badly to scoop them all up and get them some real dinner ... A couple days later I ran into the mother and told her that if she ever needed a night off to send the kids over and I'd cook dinner for them and entertain them . That never happened , and I think she avoided me after that . Anyway !

4418	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

4544	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , <NUMBER> , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

5314	uncensorednews	"This was something I was looking into a while ago . Like you I found it difficult to find what I would consider a simple answer - after browsing a variety of sources I believe a simple answer doesn't exist because "" climate change "" itself is not a simple , directly measurable variable . We can track metrics such as surface temperature , carbon ppm , rainfall , etc . , but apart these metrics do not fully encapsulate the concept of a changing global climate and it doesn't appear there's yet a consensus on how to combine them to form a performance indicator that reliably reports "" climate change "" . With this in mind , I found it easier to find information on what seem to be the human contributions to what are hypothesized to be the sources of climate change . Take a moment to consider why this is an important difference . Anyway , the metric that stuck most in my mind - and I wish I could remember the source - was an estimation that since the industrial revolution the annual output of global carbon sources had increased by <NUMBER> % . I have not found an estimation of any change to the global carbon sink rate . So from this , the layman conclusions I would draw are that more carbon is entering the global carbon cycle every year than in pre-industrial human history . And since underground petroleum deposits represent an enormous amount of carbon that was previously sequestered from the carbon cycle - the worldwide human extraction and emission of this carbon seems a likely significant source of the introduction of additional carbon into the carbon cycle . We would need to know how the carbon sink rate has changed to gauge the actual compounded increase of carbon into the carbon cycle every year . It seems safe to assume that , at the very least , it has not kept up with source output given the easily tracked metric of carbon in the atmosphere . However , from there one would need to accurately model how atmospheric carbon affects "" climate "" or perhaps more specifically global temperatures . And this is the point I have not found a consensus on accurate forward modeling , other than more carbon dioxide generally means higher temperatures . Just FWIW my personal opinion is that humans are contributing to climate change but most government involvement gives negative returns and is more about politics than action . My relatively uneducated opinion is that all government efforts into mitigating climate change should go towards funding research into improving alternative energy sources , rather than artificially restricting people's access to energy or subsidizing vastly inferior sources of energy ."

5464	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

Also , Similarly with regard to circumcision , one of the reasons for it is , in my opinion , the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question , so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible . - Moses Maimonides , 12th century Jewish philosopher or to make her more "" appealing "" to future husbands . And how many times have you heard girls like cut dicks ? Almost exclusively done in rural areas with little to no medical care available . Usually done with rusty tools and / or razor blades , neither of which are anywhere close to sterile . Every society that practices FGM also practices MGM . If girls are getting cut in shit conditions , so are boys . done in a hospital , by a licensed doctor , who takes every precaution to ensure the health and safety of said child FGM is performed in hospitals in some countries . and to ensure he feels as little pain as possible . Anesthesia is often not used at all for infants . If it is , it's rarely enough because general anesthesia wouldn't be safe . If you are not causing harm , it is not mutilation . Lets take a look at the WHO definition of FGM Type I — Partial or total removal of the clitoris and / or the prepuce ( clitoridectomy ) . When it is important to distinguish between the major variations of Type I mutilation , the following subdivisions are proposed : Type Ia , removal of the clitoral hood or prepuce only ; Type Ib , removal of the clitoris with the prepuce . Type II — Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora , with or without excision of the labia majora ( excision ) . When it is important to distinguish between the major variations that have been documented , the following subdivisions are proposed : Type IIa , removal of the labia minora only ; Type IIb , partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora ; Type IIc , partial or total removal of the clitoris , the labia minora and the labia majora . Type III — Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and / or the labia majora , with or without excision of the clitoris ( infibulation ) . When it is important to distinguish between variations in infibulations , the following subdivisions are proposed : Type IIIa , removal and apposition of the labia minora ; Type IIIb , removal and apposition of the labia majora . Type IV — All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes , for example : pricking , piercing , incising , scraping and cauterization . Are you seriously arguing that pricking or piercing and removing no tissue is mutilation , but removing what would grow to be <NUMBER> sq inches of highly erogenous specialized tissues isn't ? Doesn't matter if it's a tribal elder or a doctor doing it , it's still FGM . , the number of circumcisions needed to prevent one instance of a condition .

Whatever they're emotionally eating for isn't triggering a bell in their head that they are gaining weight , and even if If it is , many people chose to continue to eat that way and deny their weight gain . I dealt with this as well when I was in college , where a bad breakup and stress led me to over eat for a month . I would tell myself , just eat as much as you want right now and tomorrow we will fix everything . I was trying to put off addressing my emotional issues and instead filling myself with food . The difference is that I realized that my mentality was dangerous and took control over my food habits again . I think many people however just continue this habit well into becoming <NUMBER> + pounds . The second problem is that once the weight gain is accepted , people just find it "" too hard "" to lose it after making numerous "" dieting "" attempts and instead of blaming themselves they blame their body and accept their fat bodies .

No one said it will be easy and won't require a shit ton of willpower . Every battle of willpower they lost by stuffing a donut in their face will now work against them . Yet , the easier route is playing victim and unfortunately this is what most people end up doing . Lastly , being overweight is the only type of addiction behavior that is so well supported in our society . You're fat ? It's ok You can lose the weight , but in the meantime , here have a cinnabun It is NOT ok to be fat , and if people would stop accepting it , obesity would be treated like any other drug or substance addiction and people would feel compelled to lose the weight .

6140	atheism	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following : The training and certification that teachers go through . Thereby , the recommended teaching methods . The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability . A broad control over what gets taught , in the form of a curriculum . A teacher's conduct , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would you like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in general are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

6350	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

6440	milliondollarextreme	Yeah , Rupert Murdoch's children are taking over Fox News and they are more liberal than their dad . They want to make it less right wing .

Nationalism has a strong presence on the internet and a less strong presence on the radio ( Rush Limbaugh is not a gung-ho nationalist , he's a bit more of a civic nationalist guy , but he does a good job ) , but TV is lacking in any sort of right of center politics .

6868	sjwhate	"I never said "" modern "" leftist . You did . You falsely attributed that to me , called it wrong thus creating a principle for consistency , and then immediately ignored that very principle thus being logically inconsistent . You yourself claimed that I was wrong by claiming that I attributed modern leftism to the founding fathers ( and that this isn't accurately descriptive ) , then you yourself attributed modern Libertarianism to the founding fathers . The founding fathers were mostly leftists by virtue of being left of center . Many of the features of their ideology and the tenets in their writings are still leftist , and were mostly leftist for the time period . Those Libertarian features you are seeing ? Those were left of center in <NUMBER> . I . e . , leftist . Many ideals you would consider conservative today were leftist then . As you yourself said , modern leftism has changed . I don't think you realized how , because only one of your examples encompasses a minority of leftist ideologies ( "" pro-socialist policies "" ) . And , believe it or not , expanding the role of federal government into people's lives is also a very Fascist belief , with the understanding that people are naturally irrational and need government control . Fascism is very , very conservative , yet it's also leftist ? You're also taking a very naive view of conservativism . These aren't just political ideologies ; you can't compare conservatism's social aspects to liberalism's financial aspects , for example , and call it an accurate comparison . Conservatives ( of which Liberatarians are a part of , not a complimentary group or some such nonsense like you seem to think ) care very much about morality , as does literally every other person , everywhere . Modern conservatives care about the Constitution , but the ideas the ideology is founded on existed long before the Constitution . Protection of minority rights from majority rule is the single most basic tenet of conservatism , contrasted with the leftist idea of supporting the majority . Realism ( vs idealism ) , and traditionalism are other basic and so far unchanged tenets . Would you call the founding fathers realists ? Traditionalists ? Did they protect the minority opinion from the majority ? You could say they did in the sense that they wanted religious freedom , and then say they didn't in the sense that itself was a majority opinion . Traditionalism has resulted in different features in different cultures too ; for example , liberal economics are seen as conservative in the U . S . because the U . S . was originally and traditionally liberal economically . Christian moral theory and adherence to the constitution are features of U . S . conservatives due to tradition as well . Some features that are attributed to conservatives are really just conservative political parties taking opposing sides on issues to spite other parties ; gun control is both a far left and far right policy , for similar reasons : an armed populace is tough to oppress . So , to sum it up , you only gave a single leftist tenet in your examples , and that suffers from the same problem as we had before : modern Socialism isn't the same as it was when it was in its infancy , right around the time of the revolution . At the time it was the belief that there needs to be some minimum level of control over mercantilism , precursor to modern capitalism . As the majority of the founding fathers were Federalists , they can be said to have supported similar ideas though I do not know if they were explicitly aware of the existence of Socialism . While not declaring whether they ( the Federalist Party ) were primarily left or right , they were supportive of a mercantile economy as an alternative to the existing plantation-based economy , but they also supported the idea of a strong federal government so that states wouldn't be forced to individually deal with their own or other states ' problems ( and economic bullshit ) . Starting to sound less like the ideology you know and love ? Actually , this polarization we see today didn't even become a thing until the mid-twentieth century . Party loyalty was nearly nonexistent , and parties weren't measured on a right-left axis outside adademia . But something you should note is that today's liberals become tomorrow's conservatives . Your views were once further left than they currently are , because leftists love change and conservatives hate it . I'm deliberately using "" leftist "" instead of "" liberal "" for most of this too , because while liberals are leftist , leftists aren't necessarily liberal and there are some very distinct and disturbing non-liberal ideologues in leftism . I personally believe the right-left axis , or newer double axis , isn't adequate to measure the difference in direction of most ideals anymore , as Social Justice Theory is no friend of Liberalism ."

6920	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

7544	milliondollarextreme	"Ethiopia is the exception , the only state which resisted colonization successfully . It had a particularly brutal communist dictatorship though . The point you make about governments being a reflection of people's will doesn't really make sense when talking about non-democratic forms of government . To blame all Ethiopians for the creation of a murderous police state makes no sense . Would you also say Koreans are a "" nation full of morons "" , since they allowed for the North Korean regime to happen , presumably by "" pushing for moronic legislative practices "" ? I don't think they had much of a say . I notice the North Korea ranks at the top of your IQ map . Why was it easy to colonize Africa ? Again , the same axiomatic answer : they were too stupid to form anything else than primitive hunter gatherer societies , so obviously they fell easily . Consider the fact that nearly all of Sub-Saharan Africa is covered with either impenetrable jungle or other hazardous terrain . Furthermore , the climate and fauna are far more deadly and unforgiving than anywhere else . Two tribes separated by a distance of <NUMBER> miles might as well be separated by an ocean . There is hardly any opportunity for them to interact . The European and Asian tribes continuously encountered each other , formed trade routes , exchanged technology and knowledge and fought ( that drives progress too , in a way ) for thousands of years . Their civilizational progress was effectively due to the population of the entire Eurasian continent ( ultimately ) , and it's important to notice that this is an exponential growth , with things like the invention of the written word increasing the rate dramatically . The timeframe I'm talking about here is like <NUMBER> BC to <NUMBER> AD . Meanwhile , in Africa , two tribes can't get to communicating even if they're practically next to each other . And even if they can , chances are they are at each other's throats like the desert Jew tribes . And even if they're not , they're mainly occupied with finding whatever scarce food there is and trying not to die to wild animals and malaria . Their progress is due to a few hundred , maybe thousand people at best . And remember that this is an exponential growth . So by the time the Europeans come over , these guys are still divided in tiny ethnic groups and stuck in the stone age . Two things to notice here , the parts of Africa with less shitty conditions ( southern Africa mostly ) managed to eventually create more advanced societies ( though , thanks to the exponential nature of human progress , nowhere near the level of Europe / Asia at the time ) . The Zulus put up a good fight against the English , and the Ethiopian Empire resisted invasion altogether . Secondly , Europeans colonized Korea and China with ease as well . It seems their superior intelligence didn't save them from getting conquered after all . And hey , how dumb do you have to be to let <NUMBER> % of your population get addicted to opium ? You use the ease with which the world superpowers exploited African states to prove your case . This would only make sense if it ONLY happened in Africa . Do you believe that every nation that the Roman Empire conquered and installed a puppet government in was comprised of fools ? Do you think that of all post-USSR states ? After all , their governments are completely subordinate to Putin . I won't even mention South America because I have a feeling you feel the same way about these guys as you do about Africans . I've described how decolonization led to chaos and unrest ( which breeds warlords such as general Buttnaked ) in my previous message . Do you think barbarians only existed in Africa ? Putting USA in the same basket as India ( or the African states ) when it comes to being "" under colonial influence "" is profoundly idiotic and embarrassing , but I'll pretend you said China instead of USA . In my opinion , the sheer size and population of these countries , combined with the circumstances under which they freed themselves ( or were freed ) of colonial rule , allowed them to prosper the way they did . The difference is that the colonial hold of Africa never really went away , only became more covert . The colonial states gained independence only on paper , but were instantly taken back over after a period of unrest , this time through the hands of a puppet regime , as part of the process I outlined earlier . Africa doesn't rely on more and more foreign aid to sustain itself , in fact it's getting stably richer and people are being lifted out of poverty at an increasing rate . As for Haiti , independence doesn't mean shit when a country is governed by a dictator kept in charge by a foreign power , or worse - several foreign powers trying to establish a hold by pushing their guy . The next paragraph is about American affairs that I do not know much about . I already said that I agree with blacks being less intelligent , but not about that being the only reason for their current situation . I can't help but to think of the character Clay Davis in this context . This is actually at the heart of what I'm trying to learn about here I will not contest the comment about Chinese people being on average more intelligent , since it's clearly true , but there is no significant psychological correlation between conscientiousness , "" family affinity "" , and IQ . As you said - tribal savagery exists everywhere in the world . Africa happens to have a lot of small ethnic groups , so naturally there's gonna be many conflicts . Also , every colonizer effectively introduced slavery , so pretty much only Ethiopia would be the exception . I certainly don't have an answer for everything - you however do , and it's the same answer every time . I'm trying to get a discussion going and look at things from different perspectives , rather than just confirm my presuppositions I think there's a fair amount of shitty places with shitty culture and shitty standards of living that aren't in Africa , but sure - no one's gonna argue that the third world isn't mainly black . One thing , it's not fair to say I'm "" blaming whitey "" . The problem is and always has been imperialism . American , German , British , Russian , Japanese , Roman , Mongol . It's only fun if you're a citizen of the empire . I guess it is kind of nice living in a country that's <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % white though ."	EXP

If you can get a sample of someone's DNA , it is relatively easy to determine their race using principal component analysis . If you were to sample the DNA of numerous individuals , and then make a PCA chart , you'll see significant clustering consistent with biological races .

This is a common mistake that is known as Lewontin's Fallacy , also known as Lewontin's Paradox .

8732	OperationPullRyan	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section <NUMBER> ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section <NUMBER> renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year <NUMBER> to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section <NUMBER> modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section <NUMBER> , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section <NUMBER> requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section <NUMBER> before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section <NUMBER> could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section <NUMBER> requires the President to submit a report to the Congress <NUMBER> days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section <NUMBER> further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section <NUMBER> , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

9110	pics	"few facts , rather than quoting unnecessarily and extensively Granted from wikipedia , but the article is accurate , well-sourced and conservative . I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear .

9634	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself .

Not everyone believes the bible literally . I do . I don't see any other way . To read it and take bits and pieces of it that satisfy you or fit your world view is to destroy the whole thing I think , or turn it into nothing more than a book of philosophy . I cannot do that . Many can , I cannot - it would be illogical . Now , because I came to conclude that our understanding of evolution is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the biblical account of creation , I've dived deeper and have discovered science that better fits my world view .

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

9734	holocaust	Those are the claims . But , you can't just cut down a tree in the middle of winter and then burn it in a pit - it has to be dried and split or prepared somehow . It also would have left massive areas of deforestation , which did not exist as an average of several hundred cords of wood would have had to been cut , split and delivered daily for about a year . Chainsaws were not what they are today and there is no evidence of any of this . If you actually listen to the testimonies of the Sonderkomandos , you'll hear stuff like <NUMBER> bodies being burned completely to ash in about <NUMBER> minutes in large pits ... This is impossible . You can't burn a log to ash in <NUMBER> minutes , much less the log and several bodies piled on it . You could go to the beach one day , bring <NUMBER> lbs of wood or round it up there and a try to cremate a defrosted chicken ... see what you can do in an hour or two ... there will still be a lot of chicken and wood ... then try it in the rain with fresh cut wood and you'll see why some think this is just a tale . We have testimonies of people who were transited through the camp , when others said that none left Treblinka . Also , the methods described are not even close to efficient ; the technology to gas an entire train without unloading it existed . To be able to unload it using gravity is just way smarter than trying to fool hundreds of people into taking a fake shower and dealing with their poisoned bodies one by one . It would have been easier to clean out the train cart than cleaning out the fake showers ... and painting the floors white in between gassings ( Yes , some have claimed that ) . The lies about extermination were to exact revenge and to create a perceivable hostile environment so that Jews would leave Europe to go to Israel . Herzl wrote about such in his diaries in the late 1800s . Like Abu Ghraib , bad things happened to internees . This is what happens in war and it is not excusable . The Nazis even executed the Commandant of Buchenwald for mistreatment of the Jews . I'm sure we punished a few people for what they did at Abu Ghraib , but I doubt anyone paid with their life . Furthermore , the Nuremberg trials were show trials with the ordinary rules of evidence being removed . Unrealistic tales were told and the courts accepted evidence that involved re-interpreting innocent letters to mean sinister things . They allowed the admittance of rumors as evidence of actual crimes . They accepted hearsay . Germans were executed for crimes that the Russians later confessed to like the Katyn massacre . Regarding the consensus of opinions . Here is a great quote ... “ I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus , and the rise of what has been called consensus science . I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks . Historically , the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels ; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled . Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other , reach for your wallet , because you're being had . Let's be clear : the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus . Consensus is the business of politics . Science , on the contrary , requires only one investigator who happens to be right , which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world . In science consensus is irrelevant . What is relevant is reproducible results . The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus . There is no such thing as consensus science . If it's consensus , it isn't science . If it's science , it isn't consensus . Period . ” ― Michael Crichton If you go to official websites and just focus on Treblinka , you'll see that the claims are scientifically impossible and the evidence of exaggeration and outright lying has already been proved ... the debate is now about how much falsification how to determine what legitimately happened . There are a couple documentaries that focus on Treblinka , they are less than convincing . There are others that show an obvious attempt to deceive . This post is a bit large , so I'm gonna close it without addressing the conspiracy .. That post would be even larger . I'd be glad to elaborate in another post if you'd like , but in short , I got into studying the Holocaust hoax from investigating <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> .

9874	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

For example : do you remember that March For Science . It was practically / effectively a Religious March . They had their saints ( Bill Nye , NDT , Skepchick , Mythbusters guy etc ) , they had a group defined as the infidels ( anti-science people , christians , anti-vaxxers , etc ) , they even wore similar clothes , chants , etc . If you blurred out all the signs and muted the sound you would think it was some religious march . If aliens saw it they would honestly put it into the same category as a Vatican gathering or Mecca event . Now , were there actual scientists there who didn't hold the culture as high in regard ? Yes ( I was there ) , Steven Novella was there , etc . But you have to look at the net effect . Even some Libertarians , they talk about physical removal unironically . The fact is , you have to be pretty autistic to be able to remove yourself from the culture and to actually put logical consistency above everything else . It's why as a Geolibertarian , I advocate for completely open borders but individuals / private groups can buy rights of disassociation and keep ' undesirables ' off the land they leased from the government . It's so rare to find people who actually value true dialectic that it makes me just want to stop being myself around others but then I know I'll miss that other person who is like me :( But everyone always starts disrespecting me when I actually concur with someone else's good logic .

10268	uncensorednews	Your first two articles are both false equivalences . Attempting to hack and seeking to donate money are not the same thing as succeeding at those attempts . Of course it's still troublesome that these things are being attempted , but as long as they are prevented from happening it is not very significant . The difference here is that there is now proof that the Russians succeeded in meddling in our election , as confirmed by every intelligence agency and President Trump himself . You cannot let a foreign power actively influence and change the results of an election without repercussions , regardless of your political party and affiliation . If this had happened with Hillary as president it would be equally bad . As for the Obama mic slip , this is a talking point often used by conservatives but it is very deceptive and the context matters . Obama was the sitting president at the time , and thus anything he said to the Russians was within his capacity of foreign relations as the President and Commander in Chief . If he had been a private citizen when he said that , it would be very significant , but the reality is that he was just telling the Russians that he would have more flexibility once he was off the campaign trail . Now before we continue , I want you to name one thing about Donald Trump that you don't like or don't agree with . It could be one of his policies , his actions , his character , etc . But if you can't admit that Trump has any flaws , then I am wasting my time with this conversation and you are brainwashed . I am interested in continuing in the pursuit of knowledge and truth but if you refuse to admit anything bad about Trump then you are telling me that you don't care about the truth .	EXP

However , the reality is that the mod team is made up of far-right extremists , and you can bet your ass they'll be pushing their own agenda once enough people have been drawn in ( not unlike the BlackOut <NUMBER> sub , for example ) . Let's take a lot at their mod team . The top mod is / u / RamblinRambo <NUMBER> , with whom many of you are no doubt familiar . He was one of the more prevalent mods at / r / European ( which was posed as the "" uncensored alternative to / r / Europe "" - - sound familiar ? ) . He's posted comments about "" the kikes "" : <URL> and <URL> He's posted about kicking Jews out of Europe : <URL> He's told us that "" women destroy nations and civilizations "" ( ) Actually , many of the girls I know are fucking niggers and wetbacks .

Moderation exists for a reason . And / u / RamblinRambo <NUMBER> was referring to / r / uncensorednews as "" the new / r / European "" for a reason . A lot of people have pointed out the public mod logs and claimed that nothing will be censored , so who cares about the white supremacist / sexist / neo-Nazi / homophobic tendencies of the mod team , if they can't do anything ?

It's easy enough to remove something because it's "" liberal leftist SJW propaganda "" , or ban someone because "" you're totally from SRS you shill "" .

10799	collapse	"I don't know if the "" verge of collapse "" is correct . I see a serious decline in living standards . How far this will go is beyond me to be honest , but it feels like a collapse in all we are accustomed to already . I see our country falling into a quasi police state . I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since <NUMBER> has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in <NUMBER> I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then . I didn't like the Patriot Act , but the sunset clause made it ok . I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant . I also understood why President Bush sought to go to Iraq versus waiting for more to come here . He was providing targets for potential terrorist in their sand box so our children could be safe . I didn't like it , but it was a solution I could accept . I moved as far away from the city as possible to avoid anymore planes falling out of the sky and tried to forget about the national nightmare that could have killed most of my family . ( My step dad was supposed to be on guard at the Pentagon , My grandmother and grandfather lived in Somerset with my sister at the time . ) Then I learned about peak oil . I thought , so what we have at least <NUMBER> years left . I explained away any concerns that nagged at me , until suddenly one day ... I think <NUMBER> or so I thought about all of it . I realized this was not the world I grew up in , and due to things beyond my control may never be . I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience . I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain . Then I stopped thinking about the past . I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own . I changed the way I lived . I lowered expenses . I learned to cook and bake . Then I learned to grow a few foods . I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the <NUMBER> dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden . When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food , he changed the old bathroom into a pantry . This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store <NUMBER> months of food for our family . We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country . If not , my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways . We could have kept on doing what we always have . I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad . I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received . I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than <NUMBER> washings . I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline . I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat . If you can ignore all of this , then God Bless you . I can't . For me , the collapse of our living standards has already started ."	NOT

11041	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

11092	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

11140	holocaust	"Works for me . I'll paste the text here . - - - - - - - - - The Jerusalem Post ( <NUMBER> August <NUMBER> ) article about Krakowski and the Yad Vashem Archives was by the reporter Barbara Amouyal , who wrote that the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem hold <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> such testimonies of "" Holocaust survivors "" . Its director at the time , Shmuel Krakowski , is quoted by Amouyal as declaring that over half are "" unreliable . . . . Many were never in the places where they claim to have witnessed atrocities , while others relied on second-hand information given them by friends or passing strangers . . . . A large number of testimonies on file were later proved inaccurate when locations and dates could not pass an expert historian's appraisal . "" Jamie McCarthy has pointed out to me a subsequent development I overlooked . Krakowski wrote a letter in reply , published on <NUMBER> August ( p . <NUMBER> ) , in which he complained "" I said there are some - fortunately very few - testimonies , which proved to be inaccurate . Why did Amouyal make them out to be a large number ? "" Krakowski did not indicate what changes should be made in the quoted remarks ; e . g . he did not write that he said there were "" very few "" , only that there were very few . It seems unlikely that the problem of fanciful testimonies in the Archives would have come up at all , during the interview , unless it was somehow a pressing practical problem , quite apart from numbers ( "" some "" vs . "" a large number "" ) . Indeed the context of the Amouyal article shows that it was . At the time , Amouyal was covering the forthcoming Demjanjuk trial . Retired Cleveland auto worker John Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian immigrant , had been extradited from the USA in <NUMBER> to stand trial in Israel , accused of being "" Ivan the Terrible "" of Treblinka , who had allegedly gassed hundreds of thousands of Jews there . The trial was held in <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> in Jerusalem . The Amouyal report was written in the context of preparations for the Demjanjuk trial . She mentioned specific testimonies in the Archives of three people who had testified in Demjanjuk's denaturalization hearing in the USA , of whom two , Eliyahu Rosenberg and Pinhas Epstein , were to testify in the Jerusalem trial . Krakowski , for his part , mentioned in the interview one specific class of "" not entirely credible "" testimony ( a quote not contradicted in his August <NUMBER> letter ): "" survivor testimony claiming that Ivan the Terrible was killed in the Treblinka uprising of August <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> "" . Both Epstein and Rosenberg identified Demjanjuk as "" Ivan "" in the Jerusalem trial . Epstein claimed that he recognized Ivan's "" familiar gait as television showed Demjanjuk walking down the gangway from his plane "" ( London weekly Jewish Chronicle , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> , p <NUMBER> ) , and testified to various gory atrocities by Demjanjuk that he had allegedly witnessed ( NY Times , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> ) . Eliyahu Rosenberg was the star witness against Demjanjuk in the Jerusalem trial , and also identified him as "" Ivan "" . Rather early , it was revealed that in <NUMBER> Rosenberg had given a deposition in which he claimed that "" Ivan "" had been killed by inmates in August <NUMBER> ( NY Times , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> ) . He attempted to explain this by claiming that his <NUMBER> statement had actually been based on hearsay , and was erroneous . Late in the trial , however , defense lawyers produced a document , handwritten in Yiddish by Rosenberg for a Warsaw historical institute in <NUMBER> , declaring that he had personally participated in the killing of Ivan in August <NUMBER> , and identifying the immediate killer as one "" Gustav "" ( Cleveland Plain Dealer , <NUMBER> & <NUMBER> Jan . <NUMBER> , Chicago Tribune , <NUMBER> Jan . <NUMBER> ) . With some circumlocution of these and other matters the court found Demjanjuk guilty and sentenced him to death . However it subsequently became obvious to the whole world that Demjanjuk could not have been a guard at Treblinka . Consequently in <NUMBER> , despite all the lying testimonies of <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , he was acquitted and released . He then returned to the USA . The relevant observation for us is that when the Israeli prosecution attempted to use witnesses who had supplied testimonies for the Yad Vashem Archives , the results were those predictable from the Amouyal article , and worse . The sense of the original article was completely confirmed by subsequent events . That sense is that the testimonies in the Archives are essentially "" unreliable "" for practical purposes . In one way or another , regardless of whether he said "" some "" or "" many "" , Krakowski transmitted that idea to the reporter . If Krakowski does not want to take credit for being right , that is his problem , not ours . In journalism it is commonplace for a subject to regret the candor with which he gave an earlier interview . When Demjanjuk's acquittal as "" Ivan "" was confirmed one Esther Raab , who had been silent when Demjanjuk was alleged to have been at Treblinka , popped up to offer her testimony that she recalled Demjanjuk from her stay at Sobibor . The New York Times commented ( <NUMBER> August <NUMBER> ) that "" It is unclear why Mrs . Raab did not speak out until now . "" On the contrary , it is completely clear . I assume her testimony also reposed at Yad Vashem ; if not , her role as a technical advisor for the <NUMBER> TV movie Escape from Sobibor establishes her testimony as being of equal ostensible worth . These matters are "" historiographically important "" . last modification : <NUMBER> May <NUMBER> ."	EXP

11223	uncensorednews	You are trying even my patience not to downvote a sincerely written point of view . Do as you wish . Only you are responsible for your emotional responses . That being said , I'm appreciative that you decided to comment . Also worth being said : I give no fucks about internet points . If anything the more downvoted posts are more interesting to me . It indicates passion and investment . Haven't you considered at least some pogroms to be due to medieval peasant ignorance or lords trying to get out of loan ? Even a benevolent and forgiving group would be persecuted in such circumstances . This isn't about what happens to them , it's about how they cleave to it . To be blunt : nobody suffers like the Jews because the Jews treat suffering ( or more accurately injury ) as virtue . Jews are massacred just as little or much as anyone else for group affiliation . But goddamn if they don't milk it for all it's worth . WWI , WWII , The Rape of Nanking , Pol Pot , Mao , North Korea , The Middle East , Africa , etc . No doubt much I've missed , but there's a bunch of corpses butchered in greater number ( and some cases brutality ) than the Jews . Do you hear all those people whining like it was yesterday ? More importantly , do you hear those people using it as an excuse and justification for their actions in the present ? No group deserves to be massacred ( because the good in that group suffer along with the guilty in that ) . However , just as I don't deny that history is more nuanced as you state , you cannot deny that Jewish people have been butchered as a group for reasons other than simply minority too . I'm an atheist but even I can get the message about Jewish money lenders from when Jesus went into the temple <NUMBER> and flipped the tables . If you wish to look at a modern example of appalling behaviour then I present Israel . Crying about the Holocaust whilst dropping white phosphorus on Palestinians <NUMBER> . Deflecting criticism of their barbarous conduct with never ending cries of anti-semitism . Though , yes , it is scary that a significant proportion of the population of a nuclear armed nation are still holding grudges over events that took place many generations ago Whilst nuclear weapons are an issue the fact remains that they work . Nuclear weapons have brought a level of peace to our world that simply couldn't have existed otherwise . People don't like to think of it that way , especially now , but had we not had nuclear weapons WWII would have concluded in a far more bloody fashion and there would have been no reason for the West and the USSR to maintain the uneasy peace they did . The problem with nuclear weapons during the cold war was tensions and mistakes . The problem today is rogue states and non-state actors ( and potentially individuals and groups able to produce rather than acquire <NUMBER> ) . It wouldn't matter if we got rid of all the bombs tomorrow , peace is still going to be the difficult enterprise it always has been . The problem isn't technology , it's the same old shitty human behaviour . Exactly the same rationale ( whether it's valid or not ) was used to kill Jews thousands of years ago as is being used today . The same is true of rationales used by Jews to do exactly the same to those they hate . Humans haven't changed one bit , have we ? - - - <NUMBER> ) Bankers doing business in a Church . What in the actual fuck ? That's really what you want to associate with the worship of your God ? <NUMBER> ) Palestine is as much of a trainwreck as Israel and the rest of the Middle East is . All fools that cling to the ethnic and tribal identity ( and violence ) of their primitive Abrahamic religion . Nuclear weapon technology is <NUMBER> years old . None of that information is difficult to obtain . The fissile material can be hard to come by , but it's not a showstopper ( especially if you've got the cash ) .

Just to reiterate , literally every woman voted for these guys / one girl , not one man voted for them ? And the men enacting these policies aren't a problem . Just the female voters . It's even more ridiculous that you completely look right past the basic issue of the immigration crisis . Who are we concerned about in the immigrant demographic ? Women and children ? No ? Oh yeah , it's the men that are the problem . In fact , let's take a look back at history . Who started all the wars , genocides , mass slaughterings etc . Biology says that men are more violent , maybe men shouldn't be allowed to vote or hold public office . I mean , history backs me up .

11276	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

The degree of punishment can vary from horrific torture and imprisonment , to the type of thoughtless & virulent shaming you see all around you in these comments . Sometimes I think it can be hard to realize how wide-spread and socially-condoned the worst types of violence are , provided your victim is an LGTBQ member .

11551	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

12011	uncensorednews	Well in the US , among the left there's a big attitude like the only reason you'd be anti-immigration is because you're xenophobic / Islamophobic / racist / etc . On the right , the loudest views seem to bubble to the top , IE ' they're all goat fucking towel heads build the wall close the border etc etc ' . Personally I take a moderate view - I think immigration should not be unlimited , especially for countries with wildly different culture / values , and for the rest factors like effects on domestic economy and job market should be considered . Integration should be a priority / learning English should be mandatory , and for humanitarian visas / refugees priority should be given to those who are actually oppressed or in danger ( not simply in bad economic shape ) . As with others , integration and learning English should be a priority . We should enlist the aid of nonprofits to shepherd each family / immigrant through the integration process , they can hold their hands better than the government can . Of course this means the left doesn't want me because I'm obviously a xenophobic Islamophobic racist deplorable terrible person who wants poor innocent helpless refugees to suffer and die or destroy their culture , and the right doesn't want me because I obviously want to give the country away to the goat fucking towel heads .

12134	leagueoflegends	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight .

12306	worldnews	I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally . If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US .

Every homework would get zero credit because I didn't show work . The teacher's reason ? I could have stolen the answers from somebody . "" Fair enough , "" I said . Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it . So I failed Algebra <NUMBER> while passing the state algebra test and getting 99th percentile in those stupid state tests . Now I'm in college taking Calculus <NUMBER> , and still not showing work for algebra problems .

13107	fatpeoplehate	That's a good point without a doubt . What I think is that there will be two obvious points of pressure .

At the same time like you said <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of these people are medically buttfucked by their weight . In regards to social welfare programs , what isn't covered by tax income is financed by the sale of treasury bonds by the federal reserve . The sale of bonds also finances a part of every other federal program . So imagine a day when the Medicare bill sent from the hospitals requires so much of the income generated from the treasury that there is only enough left over to cover social security payments . And everything gets shut down temporarily like we've seen when congress delays spending bills . Unlike political shutdowns , you can't pass a law requiring people not to get sick . I don't know the future but I can see some the possibility of some kind of change to at least how health care is approached . And it's changed before in the past . So maybe .	IMP

He's not doing well , again ... by what metric ? Everything ? You know it's actually very hard to suck at everything he's embarrassment to the right opinion if you think that whatever principles you hold dear have merit , then supporting Trump is not the way to push your principles forward . Opinion Or just call me a moron , but I really don't think your world view is within the realm of reality of you think Trump is competent , I mean he clearly isn't ... Why do you think he's not doing well exactly ? So far TPP is dead , he elected good people into good positions , government corruption is being rooted out , healthcare is a mix bag - but he promised to repeal Obamacare and it just passed the House . You might not agree with his policies but he is delivering . which is the first in a really long line of political candidates . It's refreshing , stop hating . In all honesty I wasn't for Trump - I just thought he deserves a chance to run . The only merit I saw in him is that he's a man who went through a lot of failures and bankruptcies and got back up . That is admirable to me ... Most people go insane or commit suicide when they lose as much money as he has , but he kept chugging along and earned it all back . Don't give me that familial bullshit - successful fathers tend to have high expectations of their children - he surely felt it too . Trump got sent to military school for misbehaving FFS . But enough about my opinion about him since that doesn't matter . What does matter is he is the president . I'm not gonna pretend I know the right way to solve global warming , health care , unemployment , etc ... I simply don't have the time , knowledge , and expertise to figure that shit out . Even if I did I won't be able to change shit . What I do know is Trump was elected to be the leader of the free world - That means it's his job to lead and as citizens , we should follow his lead . At least for the <NUMBER> years he was allotted to have the power of leadership . I'm a simple man , - I have a role to play in society , and I will follow that role to the best of my ability . If that means follow the President , I will . When it comes times for re-election then I will evaluate and then decide .

13176	milliondollarextreme	good point about fractional reserve banking but thats more of a problem with that and not traders , right ? A lot of these types of problems come up with libertarians that make one have to take seemingly paradoxical views sometimes . like gay marriage for example , or debt based issues , or social programs , because these issues come from the current system , and so you cannot insert extensions of a libertarian system in a system which is not libertarian . for example as a libertarian i don't care about how much money we spend as country , because obviously it doesn't matter given the monetary and finance system , the national debt can't be paid off even remotely . It is designed for it to increase exponentially . It's either dismantle the system entirely or don't care . you can't insert libertarian shit within it because it makes no sense . I'm not so sure I understand what your idea is of what can legally be done to change it ? as for HFT , i don't understand your point really . i don't get how it's a toll booth . it's just buying and selling on a micro-scale . Basically , i don't get what you're advocating other than statist regulations . With reality , the list of complaints are endless . doesn't violate rights . that's barely something to care about .

Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right ( negative freedom ) or far-left ( positive freedom ) social politics . But since , neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject , it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents , objectives and constraints . Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them .

13477	uncensorednews	"So for those of you not willing to read that wall of text ... the TL ;D R for science illiterates is : Sex = Penis , Vagina , or Intersex ( combination of gonads ) . This is based on chromosomal makeup that tells your cells during early development whether to form a penis or a vagina or in some cases , or a combination of gonads in an array of forms dependent on the situation . These are the physical markers , generally , as to whether someone has sperm or eggs to contribute to reproduction . Any variations on this has existed as long as the human species has existed as far as is understood . Gender = Societal construct of ' man ' vs ' woman ' ( in Western societies - it differs throughout the world and has hard or soft constructs depending on what definition you go by ) . These constructs are based socially and have almost entirely to do with ' performative gender ' . This is not at all the same thing as the "" sex "" of a person nor should it be interpreted as such within a narrow field of view . Gender is understood by sociology and anthropology as being a spectrum . Any variations on this has existed as long as the human species has socially existed as far as is understood . They are two distinct things . One being the chromosomes you are born with and the scientific interpretation of those chromosomes based on our current understanding . The other , being the social interpretation and understanding of behaviors and performance that has more to do with humans interact as individuals ( that being most of the time ) when they are not actively attempting to reproduce or rear children . For whatever reason , in the past few decades the terms "" gender "" and "" sex "" have been used interchangeably to describe an obscure hybrid of these two ideas . This etymology is false and needs to be corrected to encourage a greater understanding of the issues at hand . If anyone better qualified to answer the questions involved in this topic is on hand , I would greatly encourage you to contribute as I only have the information that was passed on to me during general anthropology , sociology , psychology , and health sciences on hand . EDIT : I realize "" both or a combination of gonads "" might be confusing . EDIT <NUMBER> : Also , I'm starting to see that my TL ;D R was almost as long as the original post but didn't have half as much information because I was trying to put it into basic terms .

13589	uncensorednews	I'd have the same reaction . Literally the exact same reaction either way . We would have to look at it on a case by case basis . The difference here , in your example , the white persons probably some crazy dude that's either bipolar or maybe got super into Skinheads or something , and more than likely was an independent actor . Conversely , oftentimes Muslim people are in their right state of mind but truly believe what they are doing is just . They have been brainwashed by basically a cult into thinking that they have to kill the infidel . There are groups like Isis that reach out to young Muslims looking for a cause and train them into this . So it's like , a group . It's not just a single action more than likely in the case of random White guy killing people , but usually in the case of Islamic terror it's motivated by a nefarious web of people preying on people to indoctrinate them in their beliefs . It sucks either way . It's horrible . But in the case of random white guy , he goes to jail , everyone condemns him , and he gets lethal injection and it's over with . With the Muslim guy , Isis will find more people to continue doing the same thing so that there's more attacks in the future . One's an issue of access to guns and mental health , another is funded by a group intent on causing harm to western countries and has access to financing , the internet , and will do it's best to inspire more to do the same . I don't claim to have all the answers on what would prevent either situation . But I'm at least trying to ask the question of what we can do . First we have to be honest about the motivations in each case . So you're wrong . I'm upset about both equally . I just think one has more of a chance to do it again than the other . One's a single nutjob , anothers funded by a group intent on sewing as much destruction as they can upon the Kafir .	EXP

13692	uncensorednews	so much misinformation in this thread , it's sick . First of all , your source is an anti-muslim blog , not a real news source . <URL> This is the website of the local newspaper . I took out some excerpts for those who are too lazy to read the article : Authorities are denying reports that Syrians gang-raped a child at knife-point in a Twin Falls apartment complex earlier this month , saying the false claims are being spread to incite anti-refugee sentiments . “ There were no Syrians involved , there was no knife involved , there was no gang-rape , ” Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said Monday morning . and Investigators and the prosecutor were quick to dismiss nearly all those claims Monday . Loebs said he didn ’ t want to “ fan the flames of anti-Syrian refugee people ” but suspects the false reports are the work of a local group opposed to refugee resettlement who hoped to stir up trouble by claiming the incident involved Syrian refugees who committed a violent sexual assault . “ There is a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees , and thus far they have not been constrained by the truth , ” Loebs said . “ They have not been constrained by the truth in the past , and I don ’ t expect them to be constrained by the truth in the future . ” So , now you're probably asking , ok so what DID happen then ? surely they didn't make up a rape to support their political agenda ? You're right , they didn't . An incident did occur , but it was by a <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> year old , and it wasn't a rape per se ( the article doesn't go into the details because the case is locked because the boys involved are underage ) . These boys were originally from Sudan , and Iraq and that is what has caused the controversy . Earlier in his comments , Kingsbury said the call originally came in as “ something a lot less serious than a sexual assault or lewd and lascivious conduct . ” Loebs said sex cases between minors aren ’ t uncommon and implied that this case is being exploited by the local anti-refugee movement to make a political point . Refugee-resettlement officials called the online reports deceptive attempts to incite anti-refugee sentiments .	EXP

13714	fatpeoplehate	I'm not a truck person at all , so I had to make some guesses and look up some stuff .

These are all half-ton trucks , so their max payload is obviously <NUMBER> lbs . I think we can assume these hams are at least <NUMBER> each , so the truck would be capable of safely carrying them if they were evenly distributed through the bed . Instead , their weight is all on the tailgate , out past the rear axle . For this , I think the to win maximum tongue weight is most appropriate . For the layman , this describes how well a trailer is balanced over its own wheels . Basically , you want the truck dragging the trailer , not necessarily lifting it . For these <NUMBER> trucks , I got a ballpark of <NUMBER> lb maximum tongue weight . It's safe to say that driving the poor little truck that could in this condition would cause permanent and severe damage to the rear suspension and drivetrain . Statically , obviously the drivetrain is safe . The suspension is likely experiencing accelerated wear due to these hammies getting on and off to go get food , etc , but not as bad as if it were carting them over bumps and whatnot .

Most of them probably never even stop to think that most meals at many restaurants are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> times bigger than they should be portion wise . The life of a fatty is centered around food . Every part of the day is centered around shoveling food into their mouth . So the idea of someone eating a small portion , or sharing something that they could eat several of is very foreign . I think that is partly why they feel the need to speak up but the other part is just crabs in bucket mentality . They have to try to drag others down to be like them . All you can do is ignore them . People who lack the self control to know when to stop eating are hardly in any right state to remark on the habits of others food wise . Actually , it can be kind of damaging having people constantly harp on you about eating so little . You can get over it of course . I used to think several years back there was something seriously wrong with me . I'd watch all these people eat "" Normal "" portions and here I am needing to order off the kid's menu because I cannot stomach the full feeling , or finish what most people around me can . I used to get so anxious about how I was treated I never wanted to go out and eat . It was so embarrassing to constantly be singled out due to eating so little at the table . Then one day I realized that what I was doing was actually more normal , and that the so called "" Normal portions "" were in fact abnormal . It's not normal to eat till you can hardly walk It rankles me that fat folk don't want people scrutinizing them at the table , and yet they have no problem bullying others for eating a normal portion of food"	EXP

13906	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

13975	leagueoflegends	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around <NUMBER> to cast <NUMBER> to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an <NUMBER> mana , <NUMBER> turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip with + <NUMBER> / + <NUMBER> , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : <NUMBER> multicolored mana and <NUMBER> turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost <NUMBER> black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only . Sight Ward : Wouldn ’ t even be good if it cost <NUMBER> . Maybe cantrip it when it dies ? Vision Ward : Even worse than sight ward . Cantrip ’ ing it would still make it worse than a cantrip ’ d sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward . Warwick : Suffers from the exact same problems as corki , too complicated for an uncommon , will never find a place in constructed , but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity .	NOT

14006	fatpeoplehate	Lol . You know . I once read a novel that had an Amazonian sort of tribe society of women living in pre-technology times .

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers .

14230	europeannationalism	I was aware that the nobility had to speak French , but I don't recall them actively forcing the populace to speak French as well . In any way , you can't say this was a bad thing , especially since you may be overestimating the amount of romance words actually spoken in daily English . You're also probably overestimating the amount of people that knew how to write altogether . I believe the already few people that could write with runes ended up adopting the latin alphabet just because it was much more important at the moment . The Norman invasion of England contributed to your cultural growth and shaped your people accordingly , just like when my country ( Italy ) was invaded by Ostrogoths and Lombards . Neglecting all of that seems pretty stupid to me . I mean , I can speak Latin but I can't obviously expect other Italians to do the same . But I feel like all of this is derailing from the topic of this post . It's completely fine if you feel like all of this can help the English language , but it'd be foolish not to consider that it'd be a great deal of work that may not even be considered useful by many of your people .

14834	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

14840	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

15073	Fitness	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

While it did start as a pet project and Atko never intended to become a competitor with reddit it is a place that functioned much like reddit but is absolutely pro free speech . You can read the announcements from Atko over there to verify this all but : When FPH first moved over there they had stability issues . It was a massive fuckfest for a while . On top of the influx of new users there were people from reddit , who ran FPH off , that then attacked Voat via DDOS attacks and all manner of the bullshit that they are known for . There were <NUMBER> guys and suddenly over 50K new users over night . They needed funding in order to scale . THE WHOLE COMMUNITY CAME TOGETHER TO HELP GATHER THE FUNDING . We made donations via bitcoin or paypal until someone some where set up a jailbait sub , posted pics to it , then reported the site to paypal for hosting CP . Sound familiar ? They were offered VC funding shortly after the wave of FPH folks came over and they turned it down because they did not want to be subject to demands of others . Sort of like Trump turning down money from lobbyists but I digress . Atko and Puttitout are the co-owners of Voat and are not looking to be bought out . They continue to take donations , some subs have voat fundraisers from time to time and minimal ads . Last week when pizzagate got shut down I ventured over to voat for the first time in a while . They were making an announcement that with the influx of new users they were in need of funding . I did my part . I'm sure many others did as well .

If you haven't noticed , America is on the verge of a fucking race war . This does not bode well for your claim that multiculturalism is a success . Culture is ethnic . You cannot separate the two . Look at the self-segregation that is naturally happening in America if you need proof of this . Go to Japan , see what they think of multiculturalism . See how they feel about other Asians living there . See how they feel about hafus who are born there to one Japanese parent , if they are considered Japanese . This is not a foreign concept . And no , white men did not purchase and bring over African slaves . Every single one of those slave ships were Jewish owned and operated . As for the native Americans , they were not a monolithic people . They were many separate tribes who were at war with each other , killing their own kind , forming alliances with the settlers to fight neighboring tribes .

Perhaps America was destined to fall . Even cohesion between different European cultures doesn't happen naturally . Sometimes I wish my ancestors never left Europe . I wish I had an older culture to live with . I love American culture , but it is a departure from what I could have had .

My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure . But later she told me they had to tell Rich's friend I was only <NUMBER> . Cue about two or three years of wearing baggy t-shirts and wide legged jeans .	NOT

15272	europeannationalism	"Jews were treated a little better by most Muslims than Christians in Medieval times , which is why the Jews flocked to Muslim countries and moved there when they were expelled by Christian rulers and even worked for Muslim conquerers into European lands during the early Middle Ages at times . Jews especially found niches in many of the same roles they had in Christian nations : lending money ( due to prohibitions against usury in Christian nations and specifically in Islam ) , merchants ( duh ! ) , and bureaucracy ( since Jews were traditionally well educated and shrewd managers ) . However , it's not this simple . At times , more fundamentalist Islamic rulers would expel Jews and Christians alike , or at the very least subject them to extra taxes and restrictions . The Jews ' relationship to Muslims ( and Christians ) has been complex , but historically the Muslims didn't hate and persecute the Jews the way the Christians did , viewing Jews as fellow "" people of the book "" who didn't present much of a threat ."

15304	politics	"The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited . Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

Ideally , the specifics of the problem would suggest the correct technique to use without it being stated explicitly . From a slightly different perspective , a teacher teaches techniques for solving the problems that are on the exams . If a student doesn't learn them , or believes that they have a better / easier technique , then they risk not getting the correct answers . I would really only specifically state the method to use when I taught two methods that could both be used to solve the problem . And in those cases , there was usually another question that asked to solve the same problem or a similar problem using the other method . Somewhat related , I remember giving my students a choice between exams with "" show your work "" problems and multiple choice questions . At first , they were very excited about multiple choice . But when I explained that the "" distractors "" would be answers arrived at when making common mistakes and that there was no partial credit , "" show your work "" exams became a bit more appealing ."

Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign chairman John Podesta is said to have “ responded favorably to an email forwarded to him from a leftwing ‘ Catholic ’ organization that said it was arranging meetings with Catholic prelates to urge them to press U .

There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach some working class voters … "" But when Hale was confronted about the email that WikiLeaks claimed was sent by Podesta , all Hale could reply was this : “ What was communicated in that email is not the right way forward , but I also want to say that I know John Podesta . He ’ s a good man , he ’ s a good Catholic , he practices the faith seriously . ” Yet Podesta has stated : "" We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this . "" As exposed by WikiLeaks , Christopher Hale , Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good , said this in an email with the subject heading “ Catholic Efforts on Iran Update ” : "" I think the top-line goal is pretty clear : we need Archbishop William Lori and Cardinal Donald Wuerl to make direct appeals to Senators Cardin and Mikulski on this issue .

As you can imagine , Iran is just a portion of the work we ’ re doing in preparation for the Holy Father ’ s trip . "" Meanwhile , Dr . William Donohue , president and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , stated that Podesta is “ hell bent on creating mutiny in the Catholic Church . ” Donohue further stated : "" The evidence is indisputable : Both of these groups , Catholics in Alliance and Catholics United , were created by Podesta , and funded by Soros , for the express purpose of staging a revolt within the Catholic Church . "" "" Together , they have sought to manipulate public opinion against the Catholic Church . "" In <NUMBER> , Sandy Newman , founder of the left-wing group , Voices for Progress , asked Podesta for advice on how best to “ plant the seeds of the revolution . ” The revolution he sought was an attempt to sunder the Catholic Church ."

In fact , they just make you look more repulsive and pathetic . <NUMBER> ) Fatness is not fucking healthy . You're <NUMBER> years old and your lab results are perfect ? Yeah , talk to me when you're <NUMBER> . Tell me how your back and knees feel after a brisk <NUMBER> - mile walk . You've got PCOS and you claim you're healthy ? Dream fucking on . You are living in an imbalanced , diseased state . <NUMBER> ) No , you don't deserve to be loved and desired by attractive people you'd like to pair up with . They don't owe it to you to look past your repulsive exterior and appreciate the "" real you . "" They are not shallow for refusing to do that . The real you has given up , caved in to her appetite , abandoned self-control , and rationalizes consuming more than her share . Your fat body is the real you , for it is the sum of your choices . You are not only unattractive , you are a liability , and anyone who feels they can do better is entitled to reject you . <NUMBER> ) Bragging about how sexually desirable to men fat women are , and how many men you've had sex with , and how "" men want meat , not bones , "" and how men appreciate your gigantic fat tits and not "" fried eggs , "" and making snide remarks about how unattractive skinny women's bodies are , or calling your fat self a "" real woman "" - - and then claiming you're a feminist and fuckyourbeautystandards ? Fuck you . <NUMBER> ) Your physician actually learned things in medical school . In practice , your physician has likely seen a lot of sick fat people making the same excuses you do , telling the same lies about their shitty habits you tell , and thus knows exactly where you're headed if you don't clean up your act . You are not healthy . You will be even less healthy in the future . This is a given . So when they suggest you lose weight because your overloaded knees already hurt at age <NUMBER> ? Don't fucking whine about fat-shaming . Your physician actually cares more about your health than you do , if you've let yourself get to this point . <NUMBER> ) There are a lot of reasons why the typical selection of plus-size clothing is pretty much crap , and why many retailers only carry plus-sizes online . But the bottom line is ... the bottom line . Decisions about what garments to make and how much they will cost and how much retail floor space to give them are all based on profitability . Not fat-shaming , not oppressing "" real women , "" but rather how much money a for-profit business can reasonably expect to make from plus sizes . And they are not obligated to create or stock unprofitable lines , or take less profit on plus-sized lines , or make straight-sized women bear the cost of your overindulgence . Clothing manufacturers and retailers are not obligated to make cute clothes for you at a loss . End of story . <NUMBER> ) If you choose to stay fat , you will always be discriminated against . You will lose out on jobs , promotions , and professional opportunities . No company will want you as their public face ( unless it caters specifically to fatties ) . In a dispute with a thin person , people will automatically believe the thin person over you . Because you are fat , people ( even other fat people ! ) will assume that you lack self-control , self-discipline , initiative , and intelligence . You can't even manage your own body's energy balance ; why should anyone think you're fully competent at anything else ? <NUMBER> ) There are pople who count calories , refuse dessert , eschew processed crapfood , turn down "" treats , "" say no to birthday cake , hit the gym every day , go for a run after work , cut carbs , eat salads , bring their own healthy lunch , or don't clean their plates at every meal . This does not mean they live rigid , joyless , over-controlled lives . They do not usually have eating disorders , or a negative relationship to food ( unlike chronic overeaters ) . They are not , by default , shallow , superficial , or "" image-obsessed . "" They just happen to like living in lean , healthy , attractive bodies . They would like to live a long time , or at least not spend decades sick and disabled by preventable conditions . And they'd like to be able to fully experience life , and what the world has to offer--which is kind of hard to do when your mobility is limited by joint pain , you're always out of breath , and you can't even fit in an airplane seat . Turning down cake and counting calories looks like a great deal , compared to living as a fatty--because it fucking is . <NUMBER> ) When you get sick of being a fatty , the power to change is entirely yours . No , it's not going to be easy . There is no easy . But it's so fucking worth it ."	EXP

Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money . Man the Israel propaganda machine has done a real number on you . But yeah israel is all mean to people that are shooting rockets at their cities day in day out and who send suicidebombers to blow up their kids , how uncivilized to not simply be happy about that right ?

The Jewish people , in modern times , have obtained a sort of impenetrable social armor--you can't criticize the doings of the Jewish state without criticizing the Jewish religion it's based upon . And you can't criticize the Jewish religion because it is the inherited birthright of the Jewish race . The typical gentile knows very little about the Jewish people and this is by design . They teach us in school that the Jewish people are simply just another religion--people who celebrate different holidays like Hanukkah in winter time . The story of Hanukkah itself is often whitewashed for the gentiles , to make us forget that Hannukah is the story of a barbaric , savage revolt of Jews against the Seleucid Empire . The ZOG has conditioned us to associate the dislike , criticism and even the mentioning of Jewish things with the provocative HOLOCAUST : trade_mark : propaganda they showed shoah'ed us in grade school . When you juxtapose the amount of attention the Holocaust receives in media and education with that of the Holodomor , it is very clear that there is an unjust Jewish bias .	EXP

What they tell the doctors cannot be faked [ unless they want to help dx you ] . Then there are the tests and observations over a period of time by the doctors / staff . Combine these and the interview of the person who claims to have it , then you have several barriers to facetious disorders and conditions . Then on an anecdotal level , why would I go through hell in every year in school except college ? Why and how could I fake clumsiness / sensory sensitivity probs when I was a child [ before the disorder was recognized ] ? I had misunderstandings every hour [ that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature ] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [ and other awkward attempts at being "" good "" ] ? Why would the doctors tell my parents that I was ALmost autistic [ after-all Asperger's is a milder form of autism ] when I was having those problems at elementary schools ? I had ALL of the characteristics a girl with Asperger's at that age would display , not something I could plan or make up like many of the people with facetious disorders do . Kids at kindergarten age do not have this facetious / Munchhausen's dz or at least they do not plan-out a life-long condition , they may pretend they have a boo boo but that's it . [ My mother did not want this and does not show any Munchhausen's-type symptoms or characteristic personality quirks like strong desire for attention ] . Just like the many other types of deniers , I think YOU have a reason to dislike these ideas associated with the mind . Therefore you deny it all and camp with the anti-psychiatry tribe . You are lucky to have the internet to get more confirmations of your belief as well as Scientology [ whose founder had it out for them too ] . Me , I had no idea about Asperger's while I was forced to be dx'd . I thot I had anxiety disorder and / or depression and OCD [ with out the compulsions to wash hands for eg . ] . My mother was devastated that they had treated the way they did when I was a kid ; my father is an engineer with similar characteristics [ and seems nonplussed about it ] . Neither of them had a desire nor idea at my age that I had Asperger's or an ASD . I do NOT see Asperger's as an excuse to be rude nor a justification for my past behavior [ merely a partial explanation ] . I believe like , Temple Grandin , that the ASD should not control a person ; that one should learn manners , have continual education and reviews of how to get along in the world with people . I frequently feel like I should be considered intellectually disabled [ in the past I would be called mentally retarded in some aspects ] because of the grief I have caused and continue to cause unintentionally - - most of it is misunderstandings on either side of the equation .

I dunno if this makes sense , and I haven't really read a comic in years but it seemed there were a couple lines with a little crossover now and then . You got hometown heros like spiderman , daredevil and the punisher and their villians are around the same power level . Then you get in to space and aliens and other dimensions and shit with the silver surfer , thor , dr strange and those high level guys that deal with universe ending villians like galactus and entire alien races and shit . The home town hero guys seemed to be a bit easier to follow since they were the main focus , the outer space guys seemed to have a lot more crossover appearances so you had bigger story arcs , but you needed to keep up with more comics . Edited to add the team comics where you had a few groups of heroes that worked together like xmen and avengers and fantastic <NUMBER> , but you had to keep up with their individual story arcs too so that gets expensive .

16523	milliondollarextreme	This was some years ago , I was probably less than ten years old . I was out playing in the woods behind my house with my sister , really just kicking shit and throwing rocks . Near the edge of the property , which is delineated by an old stone wall , I noticed some candles sitting on a small boulder on the other side . Being a curious lad , I hopped over the wall to check it out . For whatever reason I picked up one of the candles and threw it at a tree . When I looked up I saw a man's silhouette approaching through the woods . It had the appearance of a black hole cut into the fabric of reality , with a bright corona . I was petrified for a few moments , and then hauled ass , grabbing my sister too . She never saw anything . It could well have been just the neighbor seeing why some kid was screwing around on his property , and the light creating weird effects , but I don't know . The experience really stuck with me .	EXP

16549	psychology	"rips hair out Can people please stop saying things like "" Game X is just a Skinner box ! "" , as if it presents any meaningful information ? A Skinner box is a piece of equipment which allows us to control the variables and contingencies that act upon organism in the world . In other words , a Skinner box is a representation of the real world . There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn . To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" . To put it more simply : everything is a Skinner box in this sense , as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning . The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule . And again , practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered . tl ;d r : Yes , games are like Skinner boxes . So are human interactions , raising a child , learning a language , driving a car , solving a complex algebraic equation , building a rocket , etc . It is trivially true , so stop fucking saying it .

16874	uncensorednews	"Quit relying on statistics as a crutch to prove some kind of "" point "" . You understand you just asked me to ignore facts , right ? Anyhow , whites haven't done shit for blacks . Decades of aid to numerous African nations says otherwise , especially considering this aid has saved millions of black lives . Speaking of black lives - The standard of living for blacks in white nations is astronomically higher than anywhere else they reside . Blacks built society , inarguably . Actually that can be easily argued because their societies are dog shit , bereft of the countless luxuries you take advantage of everyday . The only reason you black violence is considered "" disproportionate "" , is because all factors of violence aren't included in statistics . You know it , and i know it . What factors ? Socioeconomic ? Oh is this where you try to justify <NUMBER> % of the population committing the majority of rape and murder by saying they're poor ? I might be able to believe this if the majority of the poor in the United States weren't white . The poorest region in the United States is the Appalachians and it is overwhelmingly white . Despite this , the Appalachians is not as dangerous as virtually every black region in the nation and again despite whites being the majority of the poor , they don't commit the majority of violent crime . The "" societies and cultures of Europeans "" aren't "" unquestionably superior "" . I can call that bullshit on that all day long , champ . Is that why you're living in one ? You speak a European language . You type away on white inventions . You use standards wrought from European minds . You survive off medicine brought into the world by European men . You are nothing without white people . All whites do is leave a trail of death , destruction , and misery in their wakes . I'm gonna cite a real-world example of this being absolutely false by bringing up Rhodesia . You know what that is ? It was a nation built by Europeans in Africa and nothing was really in the region but a few black tribes that still struggled with the concept of abstract thought . Nonetheless the European introduced an agricultural movement so stunningly efficient that it fed itself and the neighboring regions , that includes those black tribes I mentioned who had joined Rhodesia , many times over . Eventually , blacks demanded that Rhodesia be handed back to them and the leader of this movement violently usurped the whites in charge and Rhodesia became Zimbabwe . Guess what happened after that ? All that agriculture came crashing down . Rhodesia is a starving third world hell hole and the dictator Mugabe has literally begged white people to return and feed them . We leave ruin ? Destruction ? Misery ? Ha . Those things were the standard before whites came along . The fact that you think the majority of the of whites are white supremacist trash like you , makes me laugh . They're not . I'm just stating objective facts . Me ? I'm probably not superior to anyone but I'm not going to pretend white societies and their unimaginable contributions to mankind aren't superior to numerous other ones . If there were a race war to kick off like shitbag cucks like you dream about , you'd get rolled right the fuck over . People are getting sick of your primitive & insecure mentality . It would be <NUMBER> all over again . But much , much , worse on your end . You're kidding right ? You're vastly underestimating how good white people are at massacring others when they mobilize and you're probably one of those silly muds that pretends it's going to be whites vs everybody else . It won't and I have bad news for negroes - You have no friends . No other race can tolerate you like whites have and as far as the United States go ? You're <NUMBER> % of a population with most of your soldiers sitting in prison . That's not even considering how Hispanics have spent the last decade chasing blacks out where they formerly were .

16908	uncensorednews	Paywall so Poland triggered a showdown between eastern and western Europe yesterday when its MPs voted to give parliament the power to appoint supreme court judges , despite the threat of sanctions from Brussels . The European Commission had warned that the legislation would undermine the separation of judicial and political powers , seen as a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law . On Wednesday it gave Poland a week to rethink the plans and to avoid sanctions : the suspension of its full EU membership by the withdrawal of its voting rights , a measure that has never been used against a member state . Thousands of people protested against the legislation in Warsaw yesterday , many waving EU flags This enraged the Polish government , which yesterday won the backing of Hungary to resist European officials . Tensions have been running high in some of the former communist nations , which are resisting the EU ’ s insistence that every member state must take a share of refugees . The latest dispute began when Poland ’ s ruling Law and Justice Party rushed through a bill proposed only last week to give the justice minister the power to appoint judges to the supreme court . Further powers for the minister to organise the work of the court and decide which judges should remain were switched to the president under an amendment last night designed to make it more palatable to Brussels . The bill quickly followed one that was approved last week , giving parliament control over the National Council of the Judiciary . Jaroslaw Kaczynski , leader of Law and Justice party , sits at the centre of the front row as his party votes to pass the controversial measureJaroslaw Kaczynski , leader of Law and Justice party , sits at the centre of the front row as his party votes to pass the controversial measure “ Collectively , they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government , ” Frans Timmermans , vice-president of the commission , said , adding that the changes would “ considerably increase the systemic threat to the rule of law ” . Polish MPs voted by <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> , with <NUMBER> abstentions , to pass the bill and send it to the upper house today , where it is certain to pass thanks to the Law and Justice Party ’ s majority there . The final step to becoming law will be the signature of President Duda , a lawyer who used to be a Law and Justice MP , but who ran as an independent for the presidency in <NUMBER> . Crowds gathered in Warsaw last night calling for him to veto the bill . Donald Tusk , the former prime minister of Poland who is now president of the European Council , called for a solution to a “ very serious situation ” . He said that he has proposed a meeting with Mr Duda to try to avoid “ bleak outcomes which could ultimately lead to the marginalisation of Poland in Europe ” . He added : “ They transport us , in the political sense , in time and in space backwards and eastwards and ruin an already tarnished public opinion of Polish democracy . ” Mr Duda ’ s office said the president had rejected the offer of a meeting with Mr Tusk . During yesterday ’ s debate , Adam Bodnar , Poland ’ s human rights ombudsman , told parliament that the legislation would “ deprive citizens of the right to an independent court ” , adding : “ We are planting an explosive under our judiciary . ” Law and Justice said that it wanted to shake up the top court because it had become a “ state within a state ” and lacked accountability . It was heavily criticised for making political appointments to the constitutional court in <NUMBER> , but escaped EU censure . Jaroslaw Kaczynski , chairman of the party , said that “ far-reaching , radical actions ” were required because the judiciary had not been reformed since communist times and was inefficient . Opposition politicians , judges and European officials criticised the vote . Grzegorz Schetyna , head of Civic Platform , the main opposition party , denounced the bill as an “ announcement of a coup ” . Malgorzata Gersdorf , president of the supreme court , said that the bill would transform it into a “ court attached to the justice ministry ” . She added : “ This is very dangerous for the political system we are living in . ” Krystian Markiewicz , president of Iustitia , the Polish judges ’ association , also described the proposed change to the law as a “ coup ” . “ The rule of law and democracy are ending , the independence of powers is over , ” Mr Markiewicz said . “ The minister will appoint the judges that he favours . ” He added that the measure was introduced “ at night , completely out of the blue , with no social consultation ” and “ does not fit into EU standards ” . Hungary said that it stood by Poland and warned the commission not to meddle in Poland ’ s internal affairs . Peter Szijjarto , the Hungarian foreign minister , added : “ We stand by Poland and we call on the European Commission not to overstep its authority . ” Mr Timmermans said on Wednesday that the commission could invoke Article <NUMBER> of the EU treaties , which could lead to voting rights in the Council of the European Union being suspended . The article was set up to hold countries accountable for human rights violations , but the ultimate step of suspension would require unanimity , with Hungary unlikely to support the move . Interesting comment I wonder how many commenting on the current crisis in Poland have the first-hand knowledge of the issues and how many speak to the language to understand what this battle is really about . This article misses a few very important facts as it doesn't make it clear that the opposition party who lost the last elections ie the Civic Platform have a large and powerful representation in Brussels and Donald Tusk and friends make it very difficult for the current government to reform the institutions of the state that were never working under the previous government . For many years the judges were politically appointed and no one bat an eyelid ! Suddenly this is a problem when the new government tries to formalise the practice . This article fails to mention a number of financial frauds that have rocked the country recently which prompted the reform of the judiciary and the legal system . As I understand thousands of investors lost their deposits and government-owned property was misappropriated with the full knowledge and cooperation of the legal profession . While the Civic Platform was in power these crimes were never investigated and the judiciary actively prevented anyone from probing any further . Why this is never reported here ? All we get is the photos of protests and no explanation whether the legal system in Poland has ever functioned at all ?	EXP

However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it .

"" ( However , the range is more close to <NUMBER> % - <NUMBER> % ) Running in the aerobic range is a very efficient way to burn calories . it converts triglycerides into ( eventually ) ATP for muscle work . The conversion is direct and the muscle then don't require creatine phosphate , lactate , glycogen , or blood glucose to function . Running in a higher range like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % ( Lactate Range ) bypasses the aerobic zone . ATP , Creatine , glucose and glycogen all get used as lactate levels rise . Your muscles then also use the lactate as a secondary fuel . Fat conversion is minimal during the workout . Now , if you use <NUMBER> calories on each run do you burn more or less with one or the other ? No . is the end result , at the end of the day the same . yes ... But I wasn't clear on my intent with the post ; mobile posting on the train isn't the easiest . Scenario <NUMBER> : aerobic zone . You exercise , <NUMBER> calories lost . You feel worked , but not overly so . Your body did a good job efficiently burning fat . your muscles shouldn't be sore ( assuming you are used to them being used ) because there isn't any real energy recovery necessary . If you were to eat right now , your body would treat the meal as a normal meal . Everything will go where it normally goes . After this type of exercise , your body has no deficit within the muscles or liver , so it doesn't feel stressed . Scenario <NUMBER> : Threshold zone . you exercise , <NUMBER> calories lost . You feel worked and well worked . Your body didn't convert much fat directly It used mostly blood blood glucose and muscle glycogen for the energy needs . Your muscles are a little tender as a result of this internal deficit . Your liver is a little low on glycogen and your muscles are near-depleted . Blood glucose is currently being replenished by fat conversion . If you eat now , your body will attempt to bank simple sugars , carbohydrates , fat , and then protein , from the meal , directly into the muscle tissues and liver . fat conversion stops as blood glucose levels rise . The biggest difference is how you feel afterwards . feeling more worked in a shorter amount ( scenario <NUMBER> ) of time tends to increase appetite immediately because of the drop in blood glucose over a short period . Scenario <NUMBER> keeps Glucose levels more steady over the training period ( no spike or drop . ) The net result is that you will feel less hungry after the first workout than the second workout ( for most people . ) The only thing the exercise can't fix is the habit / desire to eat too much regardless .

17351	fatpeoplehate	How do these people thing their beloved weight loss surgery words ? Do they think Dr's remove their stomach and replace it with a magic stomach that doesn't absorb calories ? No it works because the stomach size is reduced or banded thus limiting the amount of calories one feels comfortable eating . The reduced calorie intake then leads to gasp weight loss ! Nothing makes me stabbier than hearing a fat people say counting calories doesn't work . Second runner up is comparing dieting to STARVING . Poor slobs go into hysterics just thinking about about eating less . Honestly , I have a theory that they do know counting calories works ... they just don't want other fatties to figure it out and lose weight . If they did it would just prove the remaning fat ones were was too gluttonous to do it .	EXP

17939	uncensorednews	I hear you , a lot of people haven't been exposed to that kind of epidemic . However a closer inspection by the medical community reveals that people don't really ' OD ' on cocaine but have long term cardiac disease , similar to fried chicken . The majority of deaths in the cocaine trade , by FAR , is violence between drug sellers . Heroin is a horrible evil addiction and overdosing is a real possibility . However many overdoses occur because of the wide spectrum of potency . Some heroin is so supplemented with other ( dangerous ) stuff that the user barely gets high ; and some is so powerful it will kill the user . Not knowing the potency of the drug is what leads to many overdoses . There are also the many longer term health effects of intravenous heroin use , often caused by sharing needles and using poor venipunture technique . A heroin user with a steady supply of consistent heroin who uses good aseptic technique can live a long time ( William Burroughs ) , not that that seems like a happy life . My point is that if you really hate the deaths and lives wrecked by drugs close inspection will reveal their illegality is a leading factor .

You say you've heard horror stories from other states about their coverage and pricing , but then segue that into "" I really feel like the Republicans are a cult now , that they sabotaged healthcare . "" The ACA was <NUMBER> % a Democrat sponsored and passed bill . No Republican votes were necessary , and Republicans haven't amended any part of it . So those horror stories ? They're the sole creation of Democrats . You say Republicans are Zionists , but I'm guessing that you mean they tend to support our only middle-eastern ally , Israel . That's not necessarily a bad thing . Then you went full Chicken Little . And the weird thing is that most of the things you're worried about are Democrat platform items . Fuck up international peace , for example . Syria , Lybia , Red line , McCarthyism during election time . Or agitate a war by false flag , like our President's calls to "" punish "" Russia over false flags . Plus , big bank bailouts under Obama already happened , remember ? That's Democrat territory too . Dismantling the federal government is for libertarians . Republicans want to reduce it to the minimum effective size . As you said , this includes keeping things like the military . Security being one of the primary obligations of a nation to its citizens , military is not optional . I guess my real point is that it's easy to appreciate your fervor about this topic , but your level of research doesn't match your level of outrage ."	EXP
