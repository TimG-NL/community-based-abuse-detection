3	holocaust	"This isn't going to disprove the Holocaust , but if you read it , you will see that there is good reason to believe that the homicidal gas chamber at Dachau is a fake designed by the Americans after the war . If this gas chamber is fake , there is reason to be skeptical of the evidence for other gas chambers , and there is reason to be skeptical of the holocaust historiography which currently maintains that the gas chamber is real in spite of the evidence to the contrary . There is one alleged homicidal gas chamber at Dachau . The official position of all orthodox Holocaust scholars , research bodies and the Dachau museum itself is as follows : the Nazis built a gas chamber at Dachau and disguised it as a shower room with dummy shower heads . However , the Nazis never used the room for this purpose , i . e . , no one was gassed . For example the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Moreover , the "" vents "" described in the video In anticipation of visiting Congressman and US dignitaries , the Army completely renovated the room because they wanted to show these people something juicy .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

There's nothing easy about it , it's very painful , and it will leave damage on your body for all eternity that you cannot fix . Truly a last resort . Lipo is different tho . From what I understand about lipo , your fat will not go back to where it was before because they physically remove the cells ( as opposed to the cells just shrinking like normal ) , so there's legitimate usage for liposuction if you've got an area of your body that's very stubborn about retaining fat .

484	fatpeoplehate	Of course the comments have obese people making excuses and saying the BMI is inaccurate . I wish every article that mentioned BMI included the fact that it UNDERESTIMATES obesity by body fat percentage , especially in women . I think the results of this study are really interesting . It makes sense that the metabolic state your body goes through when adding to your fat stores can have a negative impact on your blood health markers and other health indicators even if you are still at a technically healthy weight . Humans were never meant to stay in bulk mode on a regular basis . We are supposed to use our fat stores in times of famine , not constantly add to them . There are so many health benefits to letting your body use energy from stored fat . Fasting or losing weight activates body processes that put your body in repair mode and get rid of damaged cells . If you are steadily gaining a pound or more every month , that puts a lot of stress on all your organs , and your digestive system never gets a break . On top of that , there's the negative hormonal impact of excess fat beyond what you need to get through a famine or injury . I do think that people who have body fat levels a bit above essential body fat can start experiencing ill health , even if they are in the healthy BMI range . I know everybody is going to say that this study is bullshit , though .	EXP

You weren't flagrantly disrespectful , which is a breath of fresh air by internet ( maybe even meatspace ) standards , but you were disrespectful at points . And I believe her writing wasn't "" semi-literate "" in the negative sense that I think you meant . You gave too little credit to her analytical skills . I believe your posts and her post were equally logical . I appreciate your caring about a vision of equality and about the , er , problematic nature of much SJWism ( depending on whether you include positive visionaries like MLK in there or just the weird internet type ) , but don't be so quick to throw out the baby with the bathwater the baby is in danger of drowning in as far as social-justice ( which I assume is supposed to mean egalitarian ) adovocacy / efforts go , despite how often they unwittingly play into the interests of the parts of the system that they ostensibly oppose .

Respect is especially helpful if you're actually planning to do anything major about these issues , which I don't blame you if you aren't and I don't think I am either . With the most condescending , tone-policing part of my reply out of the way : In your OP , I think your second definition is closer to what is meant by "" objectification . "" I see objectification as seeing or treating someone as a resource ( which is not necessarily bad ) or as not fully human ( which makes me more uncomfortable ) . As you alluded to , even the most callous person won't be able to ignore ( and may not be interested in ignoring ) certain human qualities of someone they're objectifying , even in extreme cases where they wouldn't describe their object as human . I don't think shooting porn photos of women for mainstream porn outlets compares , say , to the Holocaust , to slavery , or to parents treating their kids like mere property , though shooting porn photos could still be objectifying to some unhealthy extent , depending on the context of that particular shoot . ( There are definitely some porn photos that give more "" wholesome "" portrayals , for lack of a better term , and are shot in more supportive environments than others .

706	fatpeoplehate	That's true , but not the whole picture . Say you take a bunch of glucose , since ever cell in your body can use it directly from your bloodstream , it's gonna be used , and you'll feel that as an energy boost ( that's why those dextrose pills work ) . Fructose on the other hand can't be used for shit . Only the liver can do anything with it , and part of what it does with fructose is convert it to fat . So I guess what I'm saying is that if you take in a bunch of glucose , you'll have more available energy directly , which you passively use for stuff like thinking . Fructose gets you a lot less . So while calories in = calories out is true , taking glucose instead of fructose makes it a lot easier for your body to use the calories , so the net result is less fat gain for the same amount of calories . I'm sure there's lots more example of this , but this is just one I know of . So while calories in = calories out is true , you can make it a lot easier for your body by eating the right stuff .

Instead , I mean that if your foot falls asleep and you let it stay asleep for days or weeks on end , eventually the nerve will die . If you reestablish bloodflow and your foot wakes up , no permanent changes to your nerves have happened , and there's nothing to worry about . As long as you're not in a coma , you're not going to be able to stay in one position long enough to kill a nerve that way . And even coma patients have nurses who come and move them around a bit .

791	IWantToLearn	"^ Excellent intro to philosophy . Also If you want to go chronologically , For Western Philosophy : look into the pre socratics then Aristotle and Plato Augustine Berkely , Locke , Hume Hobbes Heidegger Kant Hegel Nietsche - - read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus ' The Orestia , Sophocles ' Oedipus Cycle , and Euripides the Bacchae . Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

"" but none ever denied what happened . Would there not be a HUGE controversy today if the Nazis were effectively framed ? They had nothing to lose upon being captured by the Allies , why would they admit to these crimes if they weren't true ? It was death no matter what they said , they knew that . The statement above is a fact , as much as the sky is blue . There are records upon records of this - videos , articles , documentaries , newspapers , pictures , testimonials . Why do even the Nazis themselves disagree with Holocaust denial ? For instance , Rudolf Höss said : I commanded Auschwitz until <NUMBER> December <NUMBER> , and estimate that at least <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning , and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease , making a total dead of about <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> . This figure represents about <NUMBER> % or <NUMBER> % of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners , the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries . ( Höss ' affidavit for his Nuremberg trial ) Why would Höss , of all people , admit to these untruths ? Unless , of course , they're not untruths . They're truths ? How did he manage to come up with such an elaborate lie completely on the fly , that matches the supposed lies told by other captured Nazis ? Why not just tell the truth ? Another point that I would like to make is that yes , scholars devoted their lives to Revisionism regarding the Holocaust . But does that make the concept any more valid ? There are scholars who have devoted their lives to denying the Theory of Evolution . Is it any less valid because of this ?"	EXP

924	gaming	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following : The training and certification that teachers go through . Thereby , the recommended teaching methods . The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability . A broad control over what gets taught , in the form of a curriculum . A teacher's conduct , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would you like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in general are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

1056	fatpeoplehate	"I love a lot of colour in my food ( fruit and vegetables are like a personal rainbow on a plate ) Oh god the mortifying incident Warning : WALL OF TEXT Well we had all planned to go to a local Indian restaurant for one of the guys birthday dinner . I hadn't told my now ex friend ( the ham ) and no one had even suggested to send an invite her way so I guess that was a good red flag for what was to eventually come ( my new friends asking me not to bring her along to any gatherings anymore ) Unfortunately someone had posted something on Facebook and low and behold when we arrive the ham was waiting inside for us . After the initial awkward "" uh hi ? "" that everyone shared with her no one wanted to outright say "" you weren't invited "" so we all just sat down at the reserved table . Lucky for the ham we had a party of <NUMBER> and we took up their largest table that sat <NUMBER> so she could get a seat . She sat right next to the birthday boy ( classic fat fuck manoeuvre drawing all the attention to herself ) we started going through the menus and the Indian waiter suggested we order in pairs and then share meals around ( different curries that come in the cutest brass bowls ) As I said there was <NUMBER> of us to begin ... we could perfectly pair up . But hammy made <NUMBER> and everyone was avoiding eye contact with her . She loudly declared that she wouldn't eat ANY of the food on the menu . The super sweet waiter was trying everything to satisfy her but nope hammy would only eat deep fry stuff ( they even offered those little triangular curry puff things but she was adamant that they would be too spicy ) after throwing a tantrum , which included mimicking the waiters Indian accent to his face , she settled on nibbling a poppadom and a raspberry vodka . The rest of the dinner resulted in having to awkwardly pass curry bowls back and forth along the table and whenever someone wanted to share anything with the birthday boy , hammy would rudely interrupt as well as snarling at the food and constantly making offensive racial slurs about the staff and other patrons . Eventually someone did tell her she was being disrespectful and should not be making such comments and she started to fucking cry She went out for a smoke and collectively the group tried to plan a getaway . Eventually we planned to finish our meals and then leave , making sure no one mentioned ( or posted on Facebook ! ) that we were going to another place for a drink .

We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable .

So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ?

1470	fatpeoplehate	Thank god someone said it . I've posted about this before , but I'm a bulimic ( in recovery ) and went through the same program as the patients with BED . It's the exact same disorder as bulimia , but bulimics just have an extra compulsion ( get all the food out ) to go along with the initial one ( eat absolutely everything ) . Most of the people I knew with BED WERE overweight , but they weren't planet sized . Most binged once a day ( or every few days ) , usually in the middle of the night , after making an effort to eat very very few calories in between . It's hard to eat thousands of calories all at once , so most were taking in about a thousand calories more than they should per week . So , again , they were fat , but to get morbidly obese you need to be eating a lot more , a lot more frequently . The bulimics typically ate a lot more than the BED patients , because after we purged , we had room to binge again . They were also uniformly super secretive about their eating , so you they weren't the people you see on this site plowing through a buffet , eating $ <NUMBER> worth of McDonalds , or eating an entire pizza by themselves in public .

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology . We have the audacity to take that for granted ."	NOT

2120	fatpeoplehate	I'm not defending the fatties , because they are disgusting fucks , but this image is kind of bullshit . Africans aren't starving because there isn't enough food for us to give them . There is more than enough . The problem is distribution , and corrupt governments taking aid for other uses . It's difficult to get reliable food distribution in war torn areas where aid workers risk being murdered for trying to help . Because of Normal Burlough and the green revolution we have saved over a billion lives with food distribution . He's the only human in history credited with saving a billion lived ( although the argument can be made Stanislav Petrov and Vasili Arkhipov prevented a billion deaths too ) A lot of famines have come down to lack of distribution of food rather than lack of total food . During the Irish potatoe famine Ireland actually had net exports of potatoes . The British landowners were the ones exploiting the workers to the level of starvation . The same thing happened with the famine in British India . The holodomor was a systematic designed famine in order to purge the Ukrainian population Same thing with the Armenian genocide The great leap forward was a famine caused by the Chinese gov't enforcing crazy quotas , taking tons of food from the collective farms in order to pay back the Soviet loan , and the collective farms lying about their production numbers . The amount of food necessary to feed everyone was grown , it just didn't get to them for various reasons . Famines are more political than anything nowadays . We have the food to feed them . We have more than enough food . Too much food . So much food the govt pays farmers not to grow crops so the market doesn't get all fucked up .

2200	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself .

As for the women , well it's not too well understood but my guess is that the amount of fat inside them is releasing too much oestrogen for the body to handle and won't react to it any more so it reacts to a similar hormone , testosterone .

I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since <NUMBER> has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in <NUMBER> I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then . I didn't like the Patriot Act , but the sunset clause made it ok . I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant . I also understood why President Bush sought to go to Iraq versus waiting for more to come here . He was providing targets for potential terrorist in their sand box so our children could be safe . I didn't like it , but it was a solution I could accept . I moved as far away from the city as possible to avoid anymore planes falling out of the sky and tried to forget about the national nightmare that could have killed most of my family .

I thought , so what we have at least <NUMBER> years left . I explained away any concerns that nagged at me , until suddenly one day ... I think <NUMBER> or so I thought about all of it . I realized this was not the world I grew up in , and due to things beyond my control may never be . I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience . I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain . Then I stopped thinking about the past . I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own . I changed the way I lived . I lowered expenses . I learned to cook and bake . Then I learned to grow a few foods . I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the <NUMBER> dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden . When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food , he changed the old bathroom into a pantry . This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store <NUMBER> months of food for our family . We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country . If not , my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways . We could have kept on doing what we always have . I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad . I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received . I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than <NUMBER> washings . I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline . I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat . If you can ignore all of this , then God Bless you . I can't . For me , the collapse of our living standards has already started ."	NOT

2803	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

3472	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

It's brilliantly well-done for an indie multiplayer game . I also forgot to mention that there is a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic when it comes to classes and the special types of zombies . For example , Berserker classes ( specialty is melee ) don't want to get too close to a Scrake or Flesh Pound ( both have high health and attack power ) , these enemies would probably be best dealt with by a Support Specialist ( shotguns ) or Commando ( automatic weapons ) , so you can strategize your team's class setup .

3488	fatpeoplehate	When i was <NUMBER> my best friend had cancer . We lived across the street from each other , my lawn was pretty big and served as the football field for the kids in the neighborhood . Well whenever we would play football or street hockey , he would not be able to come out and play with us because of all the complications associated with cancer .. you know tubes sticking out of you connecting to major arteries and such . He would just hang out at his window and watch us play as a scorekeeper . It really sucked seeing him relegated to a window despite him really wanting to come out and join the rest of us . He fought cancer for <NUMBER> years , what amounted to over <NUMBER> % of his life , but he was eventually in remission towards the summer of <NUMBER> enough that his parents let him play outside . One day in August of <NUMBER> he came out and played football on my lawn , first time <NUMBER> years . Kid ran around like a mad man and caught <NUMBER> TD passes . A week later he died from organ failure directly related to the cancer and medication / radiation he was on . I'm thankful he played that one game with us before he died , i remember watching the joy on his face as he ran around outside in the sun . Now today i see these fat useless excuses for people deliberately destroy themselves with regards to their health . They sit in their fucking mobility scooters crying about their cundishuns , too lazy even to walk . I look at them and remember my friend who did nothing but want to run around like a normal kid , but couldnt because of a real life threatening illness . It has nothing to do with beauty standards or health effects . They dont appreciate or respect the lucky hand they were dealt and I hate them for it .. I hope they all keel over tomorrow , undeserving of the life they were given .	EXP

3589	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

Where they really improved upon the weapon / plasmid combat system by letting you switch back and forth on the fly and do combos , it was ruined by the fact that every combat scenario in the game can be summed up with "" Uh oh , you're locked in that large open room , and can't get out the other side . OH NO TONS AND TONS OF SPLICERS You can't get out until you kill them all "" No more sneaking down hallways , no more feeling hunted by the creepy babbling splicer whose voice bounces down the hallway so you can't tell where he is , no more feeling of being stalked by a spider slicer . Just large open rooms fighting waves of splicers all rushing you at once , like they were trying to make Bioshock : Serious Sam Edition . - The big redemption would be if you could get the DLC , Minerva's Den , but that apparently was never released for PC . That is a huge bummer , because Minerva's Den was easily one of the best pieces of DLC I've ever played . The story was incredible , and actually got me choked up at the end ."	NOT

3759	fatpeoplehate	fat prodcues oestrogen , it also produces leptin . oestrogen does female things , leptin makes you feel full after eating . issue with fat fucks is that when you have that much their body stops listening to it , like the annoying crying child who won't shut up - that's why they're always hungry , they have no stop mechanism . some other stuff are things like brain derived neuronal growth factor . that sucker plays a huge role in why people say aerobic exercise is good for your brain , it makes new cells and things . The main other difference is that when you run your vessels become more elastic to better let blood flow and all that fun stuff to where it's needed . If you're unfit , with high blood pressure as fatties are you get a maladaption that causes collagen vs elastin ( rigid strenh vs elasticity ) to form instead . You also get smaller vessels with thicker walls , instead of larger vessels with essentially the same size wall . We have no idea why that happens essentially - we assume hormones . the visceral fat is actually essential to our functioning . it plays a role in keeping your organs warm , keeps them all snug and safe from trauma and also does a chunk of fun local hormone things too . But yeah , when you have too much those hormones get all fucked up again . - interestingly we're some of the only mammals with subcutaneous fat , most other land mammals roll with just visceral . I'm not that well read on things like preferential weight loss beyond it deposits and is removed in different places to different people ( the thighs for chicks and guts for blokes thing for example ) .

Of course , there are exceptions , like in any language . For instance will the kanji for white , has a generalized on'yomi haku .

The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities . Most players don't recognize when the game is tipped in their favor ( IE someone on the enemy team got caught and died ) and fail to make moves on towers and neutral monsters when the enemy team either cannot respond or would be at significant disadvantage in doing so . Bad players , when in the <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> advantage , will opt to continue farming , wander aimlessly looking for farm , or B + shop at substantial health . Here's some example logic in which a team has <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> advantage and should opt to take dragon / baron or push towers , in that order . DISCLAIMER : This is very general . The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron . The exceptions to this line of logic occur most often when your team has been feeding and enemies cannot be dealt with even 5v4 . - - - GUIDE - - - Hau <NUMBER> Taek Neutral Dagrons after 10mins ( or 20mins for Baron Dagron ) - - - - IF - The number of people dead on their team number of people dead on your team - THEN - group & move immediately to a dagron . - IF - enemy doesn't respond by also immediately moving to a dagron - THEN - begin fighting dagron . - IF - enemy moves in during your dagron killings - AND - team is still in good health - THEN - engage enemy for an easy teamfight win and extended time in the advantage . - OTHERWISE - back out and let them try to take it .

4208	fatpeoplehate	"Disclaimer : I can't speak for all black women . To give some context , I grew up in the upper middle class , go to a private university , and have lived and interacted with educated and wealthy black people my entire life . Maybe this makes my experience different than the "" typical "" black upbringing , but it's all I got . I think black women are often reluctant to date outside of their race because of the enormous amount of pressure to not do it put on them by families and friends . And even strangers . Walking around with my boyfriend , I have been glared at , gotten shaking heads and disappointing looks , and even been called a "" blood traitor "" and a "" white man's whore "" [ albeit , the last two were by crazy homeless guys ] - - all by black men . Never have I noticed this type of behavior from any other group . It's gotten to the point where I just won't hold his hand in public if we're walking through certain areas . It sucks , but I try not to sweat it . Back in high school , a black girl started dating a white guy which was absolutely unheard of , even though I didn't live in a racist area and black guys dated black girls all the time . I remember sitting at lunch with my friends ( a mix of races but predominately black guys and girls ) and one of the guys was ranting about how it "" wasn't right "" and how this girl clearly hated black guys . This guy's best friend ( who was black ) had dated a white girl earlier in the school year and when I asked why he didn't seem to have a problem with it , his answer surprised me . He said that it was different , that when a black guy "" got with "" a white girl , he was pissing off "" The White Man "" . When a black girl got with a white guy , on the other hand , it was because she was being stolen from black men and she was just letting it happen . So it was okay for his best friend , because he was sticking it to "" The White Man "" but this girl was defiling herself and disgracing her race all because she liked a white guy . Most of the black guys at the table agreed with what he said . I was livid . Over the years , I've encountered similar conversations with both black men and women with similar reasoning . I've even heard extended family talk poorly about a cousin who married a white guy . No one said anything , though , about my uncle who has been married to a white woman for years . Reasons for why black women dating out ( which never includes hispanic people for some reason , just white and Asian guys ) is terrible that I've heard from family / family friends include : "" All white people are racist . "" , "" He won't respect you . "" , "" He's using you to say he got with a black girl . "" and so on . I even had a family friend quote Genesis <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> to me when she found out I was dating a white guy , saying that it was against the bible . I'm not even religious . There also seems to be a cultural narrative that pervades the black community that black men should be lauded for simply being because there is such a lack of men in the community ( in part due to high rates of incarceration ) . A black woman who complains about her man is told "" He's a good man He's never been to jail "" or "" At least he doesn't beat you ! "" Black men have it hard , we're told since we're young , so we girls have to watch out for them . In black families , boys are often treated like princes . Women are expected to take care of men--just in my extended family alone , I can think of at least ten examples of women who work full-time jobs and take care of their children and their husband / boyfriend who either doesn't work or barely does and this is seen as completely acceptable ( and I'm talking women with advanced degrees taking care of men who are part-time security guards--nothing wrong with that if that's what makes you happy , I'm just pointing out how normalized wage disparity can be in black relationships as opposed to the average ) . An example of this : when I was in high school , there were SOOO many scholarship opportunities for black boys . So many . Far fewer for black girls specifically or even just black students in general . Black boys were offered a myriad of college trips and whatnot ( all sponsored by local organizations [ mostly church groups ] , so they weren't officially through the school ) . Black girls got close to nothing . Not saying I expected or needed them , just pointing out an example of a difference in treatment in a predominately black school . As for why black women may choose not to date white guys in particular , I've heard various reasons , ranging from "" He just won't get me "" to worrying that his family might be racist even if he wasn't . Some just aren't attracted to white guys . I will say that in my own experience , the thing that might have made me more cautious toward dating outside of my race ( white guys in particular ) would be my early college experiences when it seemed like every white guy who approached me seemed to be fetishizing my race and not really trying to get to know me as a person . I try not attribute people's actions to their race or gender and treat everyone as individuals so this never translated to me writing off white guys but I could see how it could for someone else . Giving a guy you sorta like your number and then having him text about how he's "" never been with a black girl "" sucks . Making out with a guy and then having him whisper in your ear that he's "" never been with a black girl "" sucks . Getting flirty with a friend and having him mention how he's "" never been with a black girl "" in a wanna-be seductive tone sucks . It's like , do you wanna get with me or my skin ? So I'll say that of the black women I know who refuse to date outside of their race , it's a combo of cultural pressure not to do it , an obligation ingrained in black women that black men "" need "" us , and being pursued by non-black guys who make it known that their attraction stops at your race and that they fail to see you as an individual . Obviously , that's not everything , but it's what I've experienced and seen through my life . Hope that helped ?"	EXP

I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it .

5037	worldnews	I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally . If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

As a bit of an elaboration , I am working to become a fully qualified general pathologist and doing autopsies is a large part of my job . I've only ever done one autopsy on an anorexic person ( I graduated med school not too long ago so that might be why ) , and even though she was on her way to recover and nearing something of a ' healthy ' weight her organs gave out . Without going into specifics when I opened her up it's as if she had been dead for longer than she had actually been dead . The impression that I got was that she had been a little dead inside for a while now . While there is a medical term for all of this and it's not a real problem to explain it with science , the point I'm trying to make is that I fully , wholeheartedly agree with you , and these delusional seacows should be ashamed of trying to appropriate something so serious to make their feefees hurt less .

5376	fatpeoplehate	"As someone who was anorexic , recovered then fell back into habits , I can say that my eating disorder ( restriction now , atypical anorexia nervosa / OSFED ) has nothing to do with trying to really be thin for the value of society or other people . I've been struggling with body issues and transgender thoughts for years now . Once your body loses its body fat , you can look male-ish without much problem ( especially since I have narrow hips as is ) and pass more as a male . I know a lot of FtM transgenders who are the same--anorexic to get the lines and lack of body fat that men have . THAT was / is my problem . I have a hell of a lot of other problems ( I wear a hoodie outside even in the summer because of body issues that I see on myself ) and while I think a good portion of those before pictures ' aren't even that thin ' or are ' perfect ' to ME , it has nothing to do with the media at all . I don't watch television / read pop magazines / etc and I haven't since I was like <NUMBER> ? Know the signs of anorexia nervosa and catch that shit before it spirals downwards . I know when I was a kid , I'd often forget to eat when busy , and when I was stressed , I'd barely ever eat . The signs were there before I ever spiralled downwards . I'm not mad at my parents for not noticing ( I haven't ate breakfast since I was like ... <NUMBER> ? So that was normal . And dinner ... I don't even really remember much about dinners now that I'm older ) but the signs of me being potentially able to have an ED were there for ages . Also , there is a correlation to OCD and Asperger's ( I have Asperger's , which is probably why I focus on a calorie bracket rather than stacking shit in categories like the OCD ones ) and ED , as well as genetics . If no one in your family has had an ED , she's prolly in the clear . And for the love of god , don't overly shame her if she gains - a bit - of weight . Most girls I know with EDs are usually triggered in it by their family members always berating their weight and other things about them . There is a way to show concern about weight without saying "" you're so fat now , don't you ever run anymore ? Why would you let yourself get that fat ? ! "" I know this probably sounds scrambled but ... yeah , sorry . Just don't make it about her image , but about health . Part of what keeps me wearing my hoodie even when it's blazing hot can-see-steam-coming-off-the-roads-out-there summer days , is because my mom ( or other people ) will always sound shocked that I'm walking out without my hoodie . And I'm far enough gone now ( <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> BMI , I can't use the scale without ninja-ing in there , it's been a week since I weighed so I'm guessing I'm <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> now ) that even someone saying ' you're too thin / getting too thin ' has me not believing them because the USA is so fucking fat , we have no idea what is ' too thin ' . Keep appearance comments low if you're REALLY suspecting her of an eating disorder . Even ' you look healthy today ' becomes ' you look fat ' to an anorectic ( not me , but no one says that to me ) . Basically , eating disorders usually come with other shit , and a normal person would never get one . If you're genuinely worried , then the chances your daughter will be a bitter fat-hating anorectic / atypical anorectic like me instead of a fantastic shitlord are pretty slim . Don't worry about it , but do know the signs ( you can find the signs anywhere online , but note that some of us DO NOT show all of these things . I don't show most of the signs of the disorder AT ALL , other than hiding my appearance , and as long as something is in my caloric-intake range for the day , I will eat that shit , which is really fucking atypical ) and stay on your toes , but not too much . ( For a little run-down , I have Asperger's , depression , general and social anxiety disorders , panic disorder and there is a very high chance I have body dysmorphia disorder [ I fit all the criteria , with no official diagnosis ] . I genuinely think the atypical anorexia / OSFED comes from the shitty roulette of problems I have .

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) .

What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical .

She was carrying a baby in her arms . The prisoner told me that as he was sweeping , an officer came and told the woman : ' Tell me where your husband is - very bad things can happen . ' She said ' Look , my husband takes great pride in the honour of his woman . If he knew I was here , he would have turned himself in . ' The officer took out his pistol and held the daughter up by the braids of the hair and put a bullet into her head . The woman didn't know what was happening . Then he put a bullet into the boy's head . The woman was going crazy . He took the youngest boy by the legs and smashed the baby's brain on a wall . You can imagine the woman . The officer told the young prisoner to bring the rubbish trolley and put the three children in it , on top of the garbage , and ordered the woman to sit on the bodies .

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear .

6311	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

6356	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

6377	fatpeoplehate	Do you think about killing people right now and taking their stuff , but the only thing holding you back is the possibility of going to jail ? I hope not . I don't think most humans are that way at all . If you kill everyone for what you want , you eventually don't have anymore people to leech off of . It's much more lucrative to trade with people . Equally so , people don't like murderers , and we want to fit into society because of the many benefits it reaps . Interestingly enough , in the absence of a police force funded by taxation , there are other remedies to crime . If you look at Detroit for instance , when they couldn't fund their police force anymore and put up a sign saying enter at your own risk , that year saw a drop in murders in a city whose numbers were growing year on year . If people feel like they are responsible for their own defense , and that of their neighbors , crime drops .	EXP

6462	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

6538	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

6636	fatpeoplehate	Finally a time to chime in If ANYTHING this sub will give hope to fatties to get off their ass and make a change for themselves This person is comparing a food addiction to heroin use . Let's for a second beleive this to be true . Do you think coddling a heroin addict is fucking safe and condusive to living a healthier lifestyle ? Would you condone a heroin user to keep doing that behavior despite all these mean people hating him for it ? Would you have glamorized movement leaders making rounds on social media that sober people are privelaged people who don't know the struggle of addiction and how they should be more open to current and intoxicated drug users . This is what is being done but just with fatties . Here is the raw truth . They are no different than a fucking druggie or boozer . When in company with such they will drag you down to their level because toxic behaviors travel in packs . An addict will make every excuse in the book to keep their fix . They will change everything around them and whine and bitch when the world won't conform to them . They were very right , they are like these addicts . But here is one fucking thing they have wrong . Coddling an addict enables addiction . We are not a fucking codependent here . No one is patting them on the back for being obese and ' wishing ' it will all go away . I have been sober for almost three years and I was shamed fucking hard . By everyone I knew . I went to rehab and got my shit straight and earned the trust back into my family , jobs , and friends . It took hard ass work and it did work . I know people who have died because they were soul-less bitches who couldn't stop feeling sorry for themselves and made any and all attempts to change everyone around them instead of quitting . Their demise will be the same . Because of not facing your problem face to face it will consume you , and end you . Welcome to reality . Now stop blaming the world and be accountable for yourselves .

Society continues to support the creation of these adipose-addled anthropological animosities . These hams are brave enough to show their skin , but not courageous enough to limit their caloric intake . There is no moderation for them , just gluttony . They feel entitled to attractive men , despite having more adipose tissue than the majority of humans who ever lived . The adipose is a marker of their ignorance , gluttony , and sloth . It not only acts as a parasite , slowly eroding at the host with symptoms like cardiac issues and insulin resistance - but it acts as a determent of replication . Males should be unattracted to these diseased mammals for the purpose of sustaining adequate genetics for a stronger biological future . There is never a time where one should strive for fat acceptance . It is precisely the same as vouching for alcoholism acceptance or self-harm acceptance . It is supporting a destructive habit that , backed by clinical research , results in a significant detriment to the host's health and well-being .

7411	philosophy	I know not much about the topic , and really am not a philosopher in any kind of way but some very interesting concepts about freedom ( not directly related to security ) had been coined by and negatively ( in reply to the question : What are the barrieres to my ultimate freedom ? ) . Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right ( negative freedom ) or far-left ( positive freedom ) social politics . But since , neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject , it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents , objectives and constraints . Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them . This also begets that security and liberty are not a zero-sum equation .	NOT

7418	fatpeoplehate	"I reformatted that for you . D ) ) I want to go through this article and try my best to explain each thing . I am not an expert and this is going to be somewhat lenhy , but please shitlords and shitladies , bare with me . Lets begin with <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> ) I wonder why "" everyone "" ( one lady trying to get around her extended circumference ) is really staring at her . Could it be the fact that she is standing still in the middle of a crosswalk that people are trying to get across ? No , it's probably because of "" muh genetix "" <NUMBER> ) Dieting is very simple . You eat what they tell you , no more , no less , and after a few months of determination , exercise , and self discipline , you will become a normal size with no "" cundishuns . "" The dieting industry is so big because there are so many planets who would rather eat a quart on ben and jerry's than a handful of broccoli and a chicken breast . Exercise is also "" not for them "" <NUMBER> ) Diets do work , how else do you think athletes who are cutting weight or people who are going from a bulk to a cut get lighter ? And diets can be a lonerm solution , it's just that after a period of time , they stop being a diet and become normal , healthy eating habits . <NUMBER> ) The only reason the previously successful dieting companies are starting to be hurt economically is because of HAES bullshit promoted by hambeasts around the world who don't want to see other people end up successful while they're still downing <NUMBER> bigmacs at once . <NUMBER> ) When people blame their genetics for them being fat , you instantly know they have the mental capacity of an autistic goldfish . It is uncommon for people to have any disease that affects them in such a way where they can't do anything to stay in good shape , let alone under a <NUMBER> bmi . If the sphere says they don't have time to work out or be active , they are lying as well . It's not that hard to run , bike , do resistance training , or even walk for <NUMBER> minutes a day , even just <NUMBER> times a week . The prejudice these hams get is well deserving , too . It may just be one of the only ways to get them to think about being in shape . Lastly , most doctors who sympathize with fat people and believe in HAES are promoting malpractice and / or are planets themselves . <NUMBER> ) There is one simple rule that applies to everything involving energy . If the intake of energy ( in this case calories ) is greater than the output of energy , the mass will increase , and vice versa . This somehow has not gotten through all the fatties out there heads and then they complain about how their body is "" different . "" No , it's not , you're just a lazy shit who likes food more than health . <NUMBER> ) Yes , weight loss surgeries , just like every other kind of surgery , can spark some issues . If you have gotten to the point where you have to get surgery because you are too big to exercise , you probably shouldn't be alive . <NUMBER> ) There are ways to get your kid to eat healthy without making it seem like they are going on a diet . Just like everything else , kids hate to eat things that parents force them to eat , which is why parents should make eating healthy a habit and make it so kids don't hate doing it by trying out a new healthy recipe from various different cookbooks , online or otherwise . Also , you can eat more of something but still get less fats , carbs , and calories . By eating <NUMBER> oz of mcdonalds , you will get way more negative fats and carbs than you will eating <NUMBER> oz of chicken and veggies . It's not always the amount of food , but the kind of food . <NUMBER> ) BMI is not always a reliable source , but if you have a bmi that says you're obese but you go to the gym , eat healthy , and have visible muscle tone , it's obviously due to your muscular growth instead of an excess of fat . <NUMBER> ) A health standard changes as science learns new things about the human body the same way our average age increases . It has nothing to do with "" untrue body images . "" <NUMBER> ) Eating healthier food while still being fat means that you are eating too much and not getting enough physical activity . While this is better than eating unhealthy food and not getting enough physical activity , it's still not actually healthy . <NUMBER> ) In the linked article , it says obesity itself may not be what causes earlier and more frequent death , but what comes along with obesity that does . So this means obesity does kill you , right ? <NUMBER> ) The studies done based purely off of bmi instead of other , more reliable factors such as body fat % , have to be taken with a grain of salt . These studies could include body builders and athletes who are at a low body fat % , but due to muscle weighing more than fat , they are categorized as overweight . Fat people also live more sedentary lifestyles , reducing the risk of death from things other than heart attack and clogged arteries . <NUMBER> ) The only times extra fat can help someone is when they are a patient of dialysis due to their kidney losing the fat that they have stored up instead of something that would hurt them . It's basically saying junkfood is making them healthier in a case of something that gets rid of the fat from junkfood . Great . <NUMBER> ) Or the fatass on camera is too embarrassed to have their face on a tv show that is explaining why they are fucked . <NUMBER> ) The obesity epidemic is real . Obesity only brings negativity to the lives of those it affects , and it is also on the rise Countries around the world are getting fatter and fatter , and due to that being a bad thing , obesity IS an epidemic . We are almost done , if you got to this point , thank you for your time . <NUMBER> ) The dieting industry wouldn't make any money if the fucking moons out there would put down the burger and pic up a dumbbell . Becoming healthy is very far off unattainable as well . If there are thousands of people who were once fat and now aren't , whats stoping every other lardo from doing the same ? <NUMBER> ) Healthy habits are for everyone , too bad not everyone has them . Promoting body acceptance is honorable but definitely not beneficial . If you keep convincing kids that they don't have to maintain their body image and health , everyone will neglect health and our society will end up fucked . Plus , fat people are definitely not fun to look at , especially in healthy people clothing .

Their moms are obese , their sisters are obese , there might be two girls at school who are normal or thin but they're so sought after they could have a face like a shoe and the personality of a liver fluke and have the pick of the best guys . This is normal to them . Now the media is apparently excited about normalizing male fatness as well . I mean , this shit is made up from whole cloth . They might as well be saying "" Wearing Jock Straps as Hats - Girls Love It "" And everyone is going to buy it because "" Yeah I sit around eating Doritos and playing LoL , but I deserve a hot girl too , they totally love my ' dad bod ' "" It just confirms the easy , lazy shit that people desperately want to think is true , because the alternative is hard . What are they really selling to us here ? Hamburgers ? Grande caramel mocha peppermint gingerbread espresso fraps ? Insulin ? Is this a push from the people who sell bariatric reception chairs ? I probably read too much Last Psychiatrist , but something is super not right here . Anyways , I'll work on it later , my crate of Brawndo is here , and CNN says I have to keep my sugars up or my kids will be autistic ."	EXP

7753	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

8176	hockey	"I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement : "" In short , it is illegeal specifically ... "" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it .

Then on an anecdotal level , why would I go through hell in every year in school except college ? Why and how could I fake clumsiness / sensory sensitivity probs when I was a child [ before the disorder was recognized ] ? I had misunderstandings every hour [ that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature ] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [ and other awkward attempts at being "" good "" ] ? Why would the doctors tell my parents that I was ALmost autistic [ after-all Asperger's is a milder form of autism ] when I was having those problems at elementary schools ?

These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

8939	AskReddit	I would figure out what kind of scale you wanna go with at first .

Then you get in to space and aliens and other dimensions and shit with the silver surfer , thor , dr strange and those high level guys that deal with universe ending villians like galactus and entire alien races and shit . The home town hero guys seemed to be a bit easier to follow since they were the main focus , the outer space guys seemed to have a lot more crossover appearances so you had bigger story arcs , but you needed to keep up with more comics . Edited to add the team comics where you had a few groups of heroes that worked together like xmen and avengers and fantastic <NUMBER> , but you had to keep up with their individual story arcs too so that gets expensive .

9569	fatpeoplehate	I have to admit I was never too big a listener of Burzum , or of any black metal actually . I have tried , and am listening to Dunkelheit right now on YouTube as I type this . But I was always bigger on older metal bands like Iron Maiden , Judas Priest , Led Zeppelin , Sabbath , etc , plus a few newer like Queensryche and GnR . I also like a couple death metal bands ; Ensiferum and Amon Amarth . But black metal continues to be tough for me to get used to . My finding Vikernes was largely chance . I was looking on Encyclopedia Metallum or similar site looking for new music I might like . Wherever it was , I eventually came across Burzum which a lot of people seemed to see as one of the best black metal bands out there . But then there was a vague allusion to Vikernes's activities besides making music , and off to Wikipedia I went . And there's why this dude sticks out in my head after a good handful of years . If not for the video and news bits that confirm so much of it , I'd swear this guy's life story has to be fiction . His account of the night he killed that other musician , in particular , is very weird . And more recently his small war of words with mass murderer Breivik is also a bit bizarre . So that's where I am now with the guy . I'm pretty sure he's a major butthole , but I am also pretty well convinced he is very good at his genre of music and that I will enjoy it if and when I get used to it .

9595	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

9776	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

Or an analogous look at it : suppose you have a giant box filled with blue and red balls . Every year you pull out a ball ... if its red , you are okay . If it is blue , you have diabetes .

10001	fatpeoplehate	I actually met a girl on a dating site who shortly thereafter revealed that she was a Gonewild regular . Before we had a chance to meet , she sent me about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> photos of her hands and / or various implements entering her body . This was within <NUMBER> hours of initial contact , as she had to obviously go to classes before she could dissect her body for me like a horny high school science project . She also confided to me that she really loved Ayn Rand for some fucked up reason . My favorite was a video from the chest down in which her legs were over her head and she had one hand rubbing her clitoris , while the other went to town on her asshole with a very minimalist , tasteful dildo . I found this very impressive , because it meant that she had to balance the phone on her head the entire time . I'm still not sure how she did it without some kind of tripod or stabilizer , but I'm sure she's put herself in some trickier situations . She actually had a few mild meltdowns in between day zero and the day I was supposed to meet her , forcing me to push it back further and further . She was obviously out of her fucking mind at this point , but I still kind of wanted to fuck her . The straw that broke the camel's boner happened when I postponed on her a final time , prior to which she launched into one of her weird text freakouts . At this point she declared that I must be a totally gay and that she was crying her eyes out over this , but later mentioned that she was just on her period , so it's totally normal to say those things . Needless to say , I still kind of want to fuck her , but in that same way I think it would hypothetically be kind of cool if the zombie apocalypse actually happened . I don't know what I'm trying to say . I just wanted to share . I guess what I'm saying is that you're probably right about most girls on there , but some of them are landmines on a sunny beach .

I also had a nearly perfect hourglass figure by <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . I had strong muscular legs , and I literally had the perfect body for a girl five years older than me . So , when I was in fifth grade , my older cousin Rich was graduating from high school in my district . He was a popular football player from an unusually successful iteration of our school's football team . He had a lot of friends . As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation , there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends . I was <NUMBER> years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure . But later she told me they had to tell Rich's friend I was only <NUMBER> . Cue about two or three years of wearing baggy t-shirts and wide legged jeans .	NOT

FLASHBACK : <NUMBER> INT NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ is beautiful , just <NUMBER> , and quite pleased with herself because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her . RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , <NUMBER> , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

10473	GradSchool	If you're above the cutoff , then don't sweat . I'd say prove yourself by taking more advanced courses and doing well . You're close to the average , so no worries Clinical programs tend to be more like medical programs than do other psych programs - they're more about the numbers . So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US . If you're applying there , all the best luck to you	NOT

10682	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks .

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang . Not to mention the model of abiogenesis has to account for starting evolution , ie the first organism would have to be capable of reproducing and evolving . edit : grammar"	NOT

11060	fatpeoplehate	"Thanks for the links And I'm not "" denying science related to health and weight gain "" like you said , just as a heads up , I'm a molecular and cell biology major , about to graduate , and had an entire biochemistry class focused on the metabolism of different sugars , including artificial sweeteners , and was taught by my professor that the fear surrounding artificial sweeteners is unfounded , as it was a pet peeve of his if I remember correctly . I think some of his own research was related to it ? Can't remember for sure though . Basically , you CANNOT gain weight without eating more calories . Simple as that . Artificial sweeteners have zero calories , and they cannot magically cause your body to somehow glean more calories from the food you eat . It's all up to what you eat along with the diet sodas . I'm not claiming to be an expert or really well-versed in the subject , I'm just pulling on what I've learned in my courses so far . As for your articles , I don't quite understand how the first one is even relevant . The abstract is talking about a link between use of artificial sweeteners and an increase in glucose intolerance ... which has nothing to do with becoming fat ? Unless I'm mistaken . But , hearing about a link between those two things is pretty cool , and isn't something I had heard about before , so I'm definitely going to try and find some more info on that but I really don't see how it relates to weight gain at all . The second link seems much more related , although I still don't think that one single study make sit clear that diet soda = weight gain . I read the article , and understood that they asked the participants what they "" usually "" "" tended "" to eat and drink , which I hardly call being precise . I would be pretty confident in saying that the percentage of people that drink diet drinks tend to be overweight / obese because of that whole fat logic thing "" hey if I drink a diet soda , this big mac and fries toootally don't count tehe "" that I see a ton , so I can easily understand there being a connection between overweight and drinking diet drinks . The article even specifically states though that "" Among returnees , baseline AS users were more likely than nonusers to have decreased exercise frequency "" , so those people that weighed more and used artificial sweeteners were ... also exercising less . I definitely kind of skimmed over the rest of the article though so if there's anything really substantial that I missed feel free to let me know . The fact of the matter is , artificial sweeteners CANNOT make your body fabricate extra energy out of the calories you eat . If you eat over your BMR , don't exercise enough , and drink diet sodas , you WILL gain weight . If you eat below the calories you burn with your BMR and exercise , you WILL NOT gain weight . That's my logic , and I haven't found a reason to doubt that yet . If you've got info that says otherwise though , or any other articles , I'd love to see them ! I'm always cool with talking about stuff like this :) Edit : LMFAO did you just downvote me and then not reply ? Ahaha . Whatever dude ."	EXP

11171	fatpeoplehate	Right now I'm researching facts proving that obesity is unhealthy . Medical journals , actual research papers done on it so obeasts can't use the excuse of HAES .

The research could lead into why fast food is more likely to cause weight gain , decreased life span , increased risk of many diseases , etc etc . There's a ton of info out there covering everything we know fatties use as excuses . After all this would be condensed into a business card or something similar , handing it out and telling people to lose weight and take control of their fucking lives would at least help in the shaming process . The fact that we would go to enough lenhs to prove that being a fatass is unacceptable and a detriment to society ( and my tax dollars ) , it would benefit us shitlords in the long run . Less hams at the gym , less at the grocery store or on the bus or at the movies or everywhere . Some of them still won't get it or won't get the motivation . That's when my shaming is at it's best .

12162	fatpeoplehate	A favourite of mine is Alfredo , quick and easy . This is roughly for one person . Put a portion or two of fettucine or penne rigate in boiling water . Fry up a clove of freshly-pressed garlic in butter , add a handful or two of bite-size diced meat of your choice : chicken , ham , shrimp or salmon . If you want to get fancy , add a shot of brandy or better , cognac ( just a shot though ! ) . Then once the meat is just cooked , optionally add freshly chopped brown champignons ( ? button mushrooms ) and grate in a fresh tomato . You can puree the tomato as well . Simmer the sauce a bit until the tomato is like a paste . Add 250ml of heavy cream and a handful of shredded Gouda cheese , and a bit of parmesean . Make sure the cheese melts to bind the sauce but keep it simmering very low . Cream-based sauces burn easily . Add in a pinch of nutmeg and some freshly-ground black pepper . Then dump the strained noodles into the sauce and stir . Serve immediately . You can add parmesean on top if it's not salty enough . What's great about this dish is that you don't need to make or prepare a large amount as it is very filling ( like Tortellini or gnocchi ) . You can serve it with a side of string beans , another green veggie of your choice and salad . ... I buy a batch of fresh mushrooms , chop them in larger slices and freeze them . There is no comparison between fresh and canned mushrooms ( which taste like old rubber ) . If you freeze your mushrooms they still taste like fresh when you fry or bake them .	EXP

12187	fatpeoplehate	Everyone else has already hit the most important points , but I just wanted to say that in every failed relationship I've ever had , after breaking up and getting some distance ( and especially after meeting someone else that was more compatible ) I realized that I knew it wasn't going to work all along and just ignored it . That feeling of uneasiness with them , the lack of animalistic desire toward them , their inability to compromise or respect my point of view - those were all things I saw all along but ignored because I was lonely and wanted so badly for it to just magically work out . It's a complicated system of bullshitting oneself in an attempt to be happy but every time it results in unhappiness . Trust your instincts . You know the relationship isn't the right one for you , you're just afraid of being the bad guy and you feel responsible for his emotional well-being . No healthy relationship should ever use emotional manipulation to prevent you from addressing serious , fundamental concerns about your future together . The relationship is parasitic and if he doesn't let you even bring up these topics of importance without treating you like an asshole , there really is no hope for him ever changing . This reminds me so much of a few of my past relationships that I can confidently say that after you've broken up with him and given it some time , the only thing you'll regret is that you didn't break it off sooner . Some day you'll be crazy in love with a man who respects you enough to respect himself and you'll have a hard time believing you ever settled for anything less .	EXP

That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

12542	doctorwho	Well , to be fair i only lived in Florida about a year total . Germany was the big thing . I lived in the country for eight years or so , just in different places . And not N.Florida no . It was Homestead . What my mom calls ' the little Cuba south of Miami ' xD yes , it is hard on relationships and friendships . I am basically a social retard . I have had one best friend my whole life , and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner . Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon . I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people . Either way , i don't have anything keeping me here . Thank the gods for Reddit . Where's your mom from ? While i agree that some things are ... i dunno what the word is ... more abundant here , i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer . And frankly , i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living . Not retail at least . If i had my own farm , okay , i could see it . But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit . I might can fool myself sometimes like today , but it was because i actually did something at work and not because i handled customers . ( re-organized some shit that needed it badly ) I dunno . I am frustrated . I want a simpler life is all , and you can't achieve that here .

I had <NUMBER> whole containers of Ben and Jerry's last night ( gotta cope somehow when the man you wanted tells you he is not interested ) . He said I am a little too large for him . Whatever , I am <NUMBER> feet <NUMBER> inches tall and I weigh <NUMBER> pounds . I describe myself as a fun plump girl . Back to my story . I woke up and I knew my body wanted something to feel full right now . So I got into my PT Cruiser ( remember fun girl ) and drove up the street to a local baked goods shop called Oat Meals . I would've walked , but my knees have been killing me recently . My doctor said it is because my legs are carrying excess weight and it needs to be shed before I do serious damage . What ? Just because you're a doctor you know more about my body than I do ? Anyway , I get to the shop and get out of my car . As I get out , I notice a spring making a sound as the car raises itself back up . It's been doing that for a while . As I walk into the store , I see a sign out front telling me that a bagel with cream cheese is <NUMBER> calories , but oatmeal is only <NUMBER> . It even had a reminder that summer is coming up . I love bagels and cream cheese . I only eat them <NUMBER> times a week , so it is a rare treat for me . When I saw this sign , all I could think was , "" Oh hell naw . How dare they try to target me like that . "" I storm inside the store . There is a long line , but I budged in front of all of them . The dumb blonde cashier was about to say hi to me , but I interrupted her with a loud , "" Do you mind explaining that fucking sign outside ? "" Skinny bitch was stuttering when she said back , "" P-p-p-lease watch your language . Anyway , what is your complaint ? "" "" That sign with the bagels vs oatmeal and reminding us that summer is coming up soon . "" "" What about it ? "" said skinny bitch . I said , "" I do not like that sign . It is personally targeting me . Are you trying to tell me that I should be eating oatmeal instead of the bagels I love ? "" Skinny bitch was looking at me with wide eyes . I knew that I scared her , and I had power over her . She said to me , "" That sign is a reminder that summer is coming up soon , and we are trying to make customers more aware of healthier options . It's an advertising tool . "" I couldn't believe what she was telling me . I was red in the face I could feel it . "" Bullshit That sign is personally targeting me and anyone else that looks like me . I know we may not all be skinny bitches like you , but that is no reason to rub it in our faces .

I screamed to him , "" Look I'm telling this skinny bitch how dare this store target me and others like me by rubbing it in our faces that we don't look like other skinny bitches . I am tired of being told that my eating choices are unhealthy . I am tired of being told to eat oatmeal instead of a bagel . I am tired of being persecuted just because I am a plump woman with confidence "" The manager ( more like dick ) said to me , "" As Becky explained already , summer is coming up and many of our customers are trying to get in shape for summer . We are trying to make them aware of equally delicious , lower calorie options . It is an advertising tool . For the hassle , here is a bagel with blueberry cream cheese on the house .

You know her name and where she works , so now you can all go in to the store and give her a piece of your mind . While we're at it , the manager's name was Dwight . Be sure to go and give a piece of your mind to these horrible big person shamers . I took my free bagel . They wanted me to eat it so they could make fun of me . I didn't give them the satisfaction . I ripped the bagel in half and threw it at both of them . They couldn't help but look at me in awe . I let out all my rage . I put both my middle fingers in the air , and shouted , "" Fuck all of you . You're nothing but a bunch of body shamers who don't like bigger girls like me I'm never eating here again "" I stormed out . Before I left , I shouted back at the haters , "" Here is a gift for you "" I pulled down my pants to show off my large rear end . I even blew them a big , wet kiss . "" Kiss my fat ass ! "" I shouted before pulling up my pants and storming out . As I left , everyone in the store started cheering and hollering . I even heard a few You go girl chants . I can't stand when people try to body shame others because we can't all look like Ariana Grande . Sorry that not everyone is an anorexic bitch like her . This endless stream of shaming has to end . When you see businesses like this pointing out healthier options , give them a piece of your mind . When clothing stores don't have our size , make a big scene . When airlines try to make you buy two seats , throw a fit . Show them that us bigger persons are not going to take it anymore . When guys tell you they are not interested in you , tell them that they are tiny peckered wimps who can't handle a real woman anyway .

God forbid men want to be with someone they are actually sexually attracted to in their one life they have to live . Who would want to waste any time or energy on that fat piece of shit ?

13333	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

13380	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

13449	OperationPullRyan	Statement by the President on H . R . <NUMBER> : Today I have signed into law H . R . <NUMBER> , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <NUMBER> . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over <NUMBER> pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section <NUMBER> affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> U . S . C . <NUMBER> note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the <NUMBER> AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section <NUMBER> confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section <NUMBER> ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section <NUMBER> ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the <NUMBER> AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section <NUMBER> seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section <NUMBER> is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section <NUMBER> provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section <NUMBER> provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past <NUMBER> years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

What I mean by that is whenever I venture into TrollX , or see a TV audience of American women , the overwhelming opinion is that a man is a shallow scumbag for not wanting his wife to get hugely obese after he marries her . That it is normal to become a hambeast after having a kid--even though there are women in Africa that have lots of kids but aren't obese--and if you disagree , such as the What's Your Excuse lady , you're selfish and should be more focused on your baby and not taking care of yourself ( or , if you're the husband , you're being a misogynist ) . ( American men , of course , have even higher obesity rates , so no wonder there's erectile dysfunction . Clog up your veins with fat and beetus , and your dick won't work . ) For an example of this fatlogic , look at Nia's initial reaction in the Bill Burr Podcast episode "" Cheating ... On Her Diet ?

A Skinner box is a piece of equipment which allows us to control the variables and contingencies that act upon organism in the world . In other words , a Skinner box is a representation of the real world . There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn . To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" . To put it more simply : everything is a Skinner box in this sense , as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning . The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule . And again , practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered . tl ;d r : Yes , games are like Skinner boxes .

13719	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go .

13826	holocaust	"I'll try to give a little running commentary on this : - Atzmon mentions that if Israel is successful in starting a war with Iran , Syria , etc .. this war could easily become a global conflict leading to a nuclear war and that very fast , the nuclear radiation would reach Europe . This would make European thinks that maybe , perhaps "" we do have a Jewish problem "" and would change the perception of the holocaust worldwide . - to be a historian is to be a revisionist - Faurisson talks about how "" truth seeking "" is pretentious . He's not interested in "" truth "" , rather what he is interested in is "" exactitude "" . He seeks little nuggets of truth that can be verified because he knows that in France , one wrong thought will land him in jail . - Faurisson is asked "" After everything you have suffered , was it worth it ? "" . He is unable to respond . He then says "" For me , it was horrible , for me and my family it was definitely not worth it "" . He mentions that once he dies , a journalist will reveal in the Journal Le Monde , something that he has been hiding for years about his life . - Faurisson talks about his first physical attack in Lyon . He mentions that none of his students ever attacked him . He was attacked by Jews coming from Paris to Lyon by train led by a Jewish professor . Faurisson has been attacked <NUMBER> times . The first time he was sprayed with pepper spray . - Difference between a lie and a historical lie . A lie has many liars , a historical lie has few liars but many many people being lied to . - Major political powers throughout the world are horrified by Faurisson's historical work because History is about concealment of the past and Faurisson lifts the veil of history . - Faurisson says that "" everyone is France is afraid of Jewish power , and that if Jews understood how afraid the French were , even Jews would be surprised "" - Atzmon says that the Jewish masses don't understand how they are pawns being played by a cognitive Jewish elite . He brings it back to the Holocaust by reminding us that the Jewish masses were punished as a whole for the mistakes of few Jewish elites . And now , the Jewish elites are even more brasen and aggressive than before WWII . Why do you think Jews can't learn from history ? ( Of all people they should have learned the lesson of the holocaust - screw with a native people enough and they will kick you out . ) - Holocaust as the new Jewish / western religion with it's shrines popping up throughout the western world . - Faurisson reminds us that in the 70s when he was first published in Le Monde , the "" historians "" responded to him . <NUMBER> famous historians / professors responded with "" We shouldn't ask the question of the gas chambers because it happened . "" . This became the slogan of historians , their religion , there was no more questioning . This is akin to saying "" I believe in God because he exists "" . - What it is about the holocaust that makes it so easy to fall into religious belief ? The holocaust has become a religion because the historians have not been able to answer the important questions . There is a void that is filled with faith since there is no scientific proof . - Faurisson reminds us that "" Extermination camp "" is an american invention / phrase . Vernichtungslager was never a word for the camps in German . - Hilberg said : "" Faurisson has forced us to relook at the documents and find evidence we had not before "" . - Hilberg's famous quote "" What began in <NUMBER> was a process of destruction not planned in advance , not organized centrally by any agency . There was no blueprint and there was no budget for destructive measures . They were taken step by step , one step at a time . Thus came about not so much a plan being carried out , but an incredible meeting of minds , a consensus - - mind reading by a far-flung bureaucracy . "" This is pointed out as being a religious belief by Faurisson . By this time , there was no more questioning , the holocaust was a religion . ( As a side note , all those who claim that Hitler's <NUMBER> speech were he mentions that the war would end not with the annihilation of the German race but the extinction of the Jewish race was a plan to murder are going directly against Hilberg , the <NUMBER> historian of the holocaust . Does that make them deniers ? ) - Of course Hilberg revised his claim about two Hitlerite orders to kill Jews . Does that make him a revisionist ? - Atzmon talks about Frankfurt school and the <NUMBER> ' revolution as culprits in the immense project of upheaval and destruction of the Europeans . - Atzmon : "" In this phase of Holocaust religion , we see more and more laws and less freedom . "" Says that Judaism is not ethical . He bemoans the death of the Europeans due to the Holocaust religion . - Atzmon : "" If people think Faurisson is wrong , prove it and if they are found to be wrong themselves .. they need to live with it "" ."

13833	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

People can lose the weight , but their entire hormone system ( insulin and leptin especially ) is fucked , and all those fat cells are still there wanting to get refilled with fat . We usually just see the fucking horrid damage to the skin , but I think it's much worse on the inside .

I did an informal survey of several dozen all-time top posts in / r / progresspics - virtually all regained significant weight back .

14069	fatpeoplehate	"their major accomplishments happened in the <NUMBER> ' s or before , and ever since then it has been a mostly useless movement Well , I would argue that this viewpoint only really takes feminism in the United States into consideration . Globally , gender inequality is undeniably still a large issue . Women didn't gain the right to vote in Iraq , Kuwait , UAE , and a handful of other countries until post - <NUMBER> . They still can't vote in Saudi Arabia . In many countries , the law doesn't protect women against gender discrimination the way it does in the United States . I agree with you that in the US , the major leaps that women needed to make have been made . There isn't such a large gender gap in most aspects of American life that it would impair women's lives to any serious degree ( though I am sure there are exceptions in certain communities , but I'm trying to be as broad as possible here ) . So on that point I do agree with you and I completely understand where you're coming from . But I refuse to take such an American-centric view of feminism . To say that it's useless ignores the fact that there are serious injustices against women and girls throughout much of the developing world . It's worth saying that I don't agree with "" Tumblr feminists "" at all . I think many of the issues ( like Fat Acceptance , ugh ) are trivial and often just stupid . But I want to reiterate that painting an entire collection of ideologies as useless because of "" Tumblr feminism "" is unfair to those who actually do need various forms of feminism ( mostly underrepresented women in developing countries ) ."

14109	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

14324	politics	"The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited . Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

15583	fatpeoplehate	Eggs are either fried or poached and since fat bitches dont poach shit , I'm going to go with fried . The beans should be good but I can see there are a number of unlisted ingredients and the sausages appear to be hot dogs from the lack of a ground interior texture . Additionally , the whole bean scramble has a bit of a shine about it , oil was likely used in this along with the eggs . There is nothing wrong with the breakfast if she stuck to the listed components of eggs , beans , sausage and bacon . The issue I see here is she went far beyond the list , tossed everything in what is likely a cheap trans fat filled oil and replaced some of the ingredients with cheap knock offs which doesn't matter much to a fatty since they can't discern the difference with their high rate of intake and nuked taste buds .

Smokers also arent delusional to believe smoking is healthy . Ive never met one person who is in denial that their smoking is healthy . Furthermore , smokers arent trying to countershame people in society into accepting them and their hideousness unlike the fatties . There is no smoker's acceptance movement trying to be in my face and generally speaking screw up the world / change up the beautiful mainstream .

I hope I didn't come across like I was bitching about my friends as if we were sitting together at a cafe like I can't get over it . The situation was cause for thought for me and I thought it was cause for thought for others allowing an interesting discussion to open up . I'm unsure about your advice to : Instead of telling your friends to completely stop , you could have just as easily used what your friends were doing to give value to the entire restaurant . You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people . Perhaps I need to clarify , but the example I use in my article is happening in a sushi restaurant . It irritated me that my friends were acting out in a classy establishment . I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance , but in any case , it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person , in fact , part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values .

15928	Fitness	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

16023	fatpeoplehate	I went ahead and re wrote this article so it's easy to see what kind of person writes shit like this . Enjoy shitlords . I ’ m not sure I could love Alcohol more than I already do . A fifth of gin , pulled from a brown paper bag ; cheap plastic handle vodka and coke ; drinks overflowin with mixers and ice . Mmm , I want them all — and I don ’ t discriminate . Beer , Malt liquor , whiskey , bud light and top shelf scotch — they can all get in my tall glass , even if sometimes the taste isn ’ t quite so appetising . You see , this isn ’ t some kind of dirty little secret that I ’ m sharing with you support-group style , nor is it a filthy , guilty pleasure to be shamefully admitted and absolved of . It ’ s not like listening to Ke $ ha warbling “ TIMBERRR ” on full volume when no-one else is home — although I do that too , and booze would only improve the scenario . The truth is : I fucking love Alcohol . It ’ s not even about drinking my feelings . drinking my feelings means wine coolers ; specifically , Bartles & James . If times are hard , I ’ ll resort to boxed wine ; if things are really tough — heartbreak levels of tough — you ’ ll find me in bed drinking the boxed wine straight from the bag , quietly sobbing , merlot smudged on my cheeks . In these rock-bottom situations , shitting the bed is acceptable , understandable . But even for me , empty fifth bottles getting tangled up in pyjamas is a step too far . Drinking is not about fixing broken hearts : It'a about pure , sloppy drunken joy . A fifth of liquor for breakfast might signify an alcohol problem to you , but to me every pull is like going home to clean clothes and fresh tap water after a week spent waist deep in a mud at a festival , having survived purely on cider and MDMA — i . e . , heaven . I blame sitting on my dad ’ s car bonnet at age eight , scrapping with my sisters over who got the last beer from Dad's <NUMBER> pack , brandishing empty bottles at each other like Game of Thrones extras who got left out of some hard-earned flaying . Then came the pheromone-heady days of sitting in cars with boys , trying to somehow make sucking on a sloppy drunken makeout seductive because Kelis told us it was totally the right thing to do . That was followed by a three-year cycle of making it to lectures on two hours of sleep , with the knowledge that the only thing making getting to class possible is lots of coffee and that most sexy of coffee creamers : Whipped cream flavored Vodka . Oh yes , the defining taste of many a regret-filled <NUMBER> AM kiss . That ’ s not forgetting the time I incurred the wrath of my teachers on a school trip to Paris . They wanted to go eat at a nice upscale winery , while I considered it necessary to forgo a delicious meal with my classmate for a beautiful liquor store calling to me from round the corner of the Sacré-Coeur . What , after all , is more French than French Forty Oz Malt liquors ? <NUMBER> of them . Apparently I was on my own . A weekend in Barcelona in <NUMBER> - degree heat was also defined by pilgrimages to the local liquor , sweaty and weak with the shakes , sipping watery beers as slowly as possible in order to keep withdrawals at bay .. While at Abu Dhabi ’ s airport — while waiting for a connecting flight after drinking nothing but water for breakfast , lunch , and dinner every day for two weeks in India — I even crawled up an escalator , mouth-crying happy tears of saliva , as a bar came breathtakingly into view . A peaceful , stomach-settling calm washed over me with each glass of whiskey , each tequila shot , as I slid wonderfully into a drunken stupor . To be fair , I never really stood a chance at developing any kind of willpower when it came to Alcohol . My mother marched me to a bar when I hit <NUMBER> , having not yet tried a beer topped with a thick foamy head , poured straight from the tap leading to who knows where being the counter . It was a real moment , that — and when we did a runner from the liquor store together . I have a lot to thank her for . Not least is the knowledge that the best way to go for your death row , last-night-on Earth drink isn ’ t fancy , obvious beverages like the finest french wine , Aged single malt scotch older than you are , or a cold microbrew hand crafted for flavor to entertain the palate of the most refined beer drinkers . It ’ s two <NUMBER> oz Steel Reserves : High Gravity , no glass , no argument . Don ’ t judge . Except , people do , don ’ t they ? Nothing riles up the drink counting , sober at work , non drunk driving , cheap beer free , don't get sloppy drunk on Tuesdays , <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> sobermasochist party pooper contingent like someone happily pulling off a brown bagged bottle of booze to re-emerge from the bushes with vomit all over their pants , this mornings Irish Coffee plastered to chins , half empty tall boys poking out of pockets for later ( they are excellent warm — you should try it ) . These righteous social drinkers murmur scathingly , “ That ’ s no way to live , ” like they ’ re better than this , and flaunt their clean clothes and ability to hold a job to spit condescendingly : “ I haven ’ t gotten drunk in years ” Then they either shamefully steal a sip of my drink , robbing me of cheap booze buzz goodness in the process ( I don ’ t share ) while they ruefully plot their guilt-ridden week of not drinking the next day related atonement , or talk up their hangovers , run to call a cab ( “ No , keeping to the back roads isn't safe ” ) , and then dash home to a big glass of water , not even with ice . The snobbery makes you want to ram cheap beer and vodka down their temple-like throats . I like water and sobriety as much as the straight edge kid , but sometimes Ice water and a glass of wine just don't cut it . Sometimes you want — no , need — a couple 4Lokos , however “ disgusting ” it may be to some . Sure , I don ’ t appreciate the fact that every single sip is another slap in the face to my liver , however it makes my problems seem smaller . It is a shame , to be fair . I admit there are weekends when I seriously worry that if you took a blood sample , there would be more blood than alcohol . But I can ’ t stop . I don ’ t want to . And you can ’ t make me . So shut up and have another sip	EXP

16446	fatpeoplehate	They're correct on a quite few things , it's just then when they're wrong they're really fucking wrong unfortunately .

Plus , they've been campaigning for major food brands to simply add vegan or vegetarian options so that people can have those choices available too , which I think is a pretty good thing . And they recently were able to get the Arizona governor to veto a bill that sought to remove all farm and livestock animals from the states anti-cruelty policies ( meaning there would be a lot more inhumane tactics used against livestock and farming ) , so that these animals could stay legally protected . They just generally want more humane treatment for animals , and despite their crazy past they're actually a fair bit better now and work toward things like more humane laws in animal agriculture , reducing animal testing , fighting against the cruel treatment animals endure in circuses ( they recently got another state to ban the use of bullhooks - which are basically glorified spears - against elephants ) , trying to outlaw puppy mills , and other relatively reasonable things . Sure , they've still got some weird things ( like they're trying to get some grocery food chain to stop using a lion in their ads apparently ) , but I do feel like the old shtick about Peta being crazy is a bit outdated .

16464	fatpeoplehate	I'm not sure about the movie haven't seen it yet , but I've taught wilderness survival and know for a fact fatties do not fare well in a survival situation ( survival of the fittest , teehee ) for so many reasons : They are incapable of basic tasks , they can't do anything requiring any kind of endurance The few things they can do take an enormous amount of energy which is really bad if you're on limited food They sweat profusely which greatly increases risk of dehydration and hypothermia ( a common saying is you sweat you die ) Their body is a huge insulator increasing risk of heatstroke The sheer amount of surface area on their skin can lead to huge sunburns or frostbite which can also get infected and can potentially kill you if untreated Terrible hygiene also can lead to infection Bugs absolutely love fat people as they are a walking buffet to whole swarms of them ( plus the odour they emit is like a homing beacon ) , and the bites can also lead to infection Basically fat people do not survive in a long term survival situation for very long .

Whether it takes place at noon or in the evening is mostly a cultural thing . For instance , many people who grew up in the American South and / or on farms traditionally ate larger meals at noontime to give them the strenh to keep working through the afternoon . Supper is more specifically a lighter evening meal . Rooted in the word "" to sup "" , it comes , again , from farming traditions — many farming families would have a pot of soup cooking throughout the day , and would eat it in the evening — specifically , they would "" sup "" the soup . Lunch is almost the midday equivalent of supper — it's also a lighter and less formal meal than Dinner , but is used specifically when referring to a midday meal . So whether you use lunch / dinner or dinner / supper is heavily determined by when your culture traditionally has its largest meal . but these are terms that were used in the past . in modern times breakfast is what they eat in the morning , lunch is what they call a midday meal , and dinner is what they eat before bed . some people still use the term "" supper "" , but at this day in age it usually means ' dinner ' . and .. this , paired with the fact that <NUMBER> % of america is now overweight and thus they eat way more often than three times a day is why you were confused ( not to mention the constant snacking . where i live a snack is an apple or an orange ... not so much in america . ) We have quality with good quantity . They have very poor quality in extreme quantities . that seems to be the american way when it comes to food , yup . and countries which look up to america seem to be following this path as well some parts of europe are very americanized and i noticed this to be the case . And sorry if I offended you , friend , please don't be a sad shitlord no worries i wasn't offended , i've just been lurking this sub for a while now , and i am aware some people from eating disorder subs come here . these people are battling a real mental issue when it comes to eating and food , so i don't want them to be nudged back down the wrong path by thinking of the food as the enemy . :( i care about our fellow shitlords . <NUMBER> again , sorry if i came off as rude spread the fat hate indeed . :D"	EXP

At least you're not utterly out of your mind and hallucinating like [ the other one from the same thread you came from ] ( <URL> seem to be someone who used to really care about fitness but just slipped into letting yourself go , so you may be redeemable . Before the main point , the first thing I want to point out goes back to the reason this post is here , and that is that you've made it clear that you're giving yourself mental comfort over the fact that random laymen you come across aren't good at estimating what a given bodyweight actually looks like once it goes above 250lbs or so . This doesn't mean you don't look your weight , it means you're asking people with no experience estimating it . I can guarantee you that if you posted your pic to / r / fitness with your height , that you would get estimates of <NUMBER> - 350lbs from the experienced people , because we're looking at and dealing with what all manner of bodyweights look like all the time . We know what we're looking at , and you look exactly your weight . Moving on to the real point though . Injuries don't enter into this : if you don't want to be fat , then you won't be . You don't need to move a single muscle to lose weight ... just make sure you have a caloric deficit , and you could be bedridden and shed the weight . It's all a matter of caring . [ I just looked it up ] ( <URL> and if you didn't exercise at all , your TDEE is <NUMBER> calories . That means that to gain weight as you said you have been , you are eating more than that every day . That's a shitload for someone not working out . To lose a pound a week , all that's required of you is to eat no more than <NUMBER> calories a day , and 2lbs a week would be sticking to <NUMBER> . That's entirely doable with almost no effort other than entering things into myfitnesspal accurately . If your old lift numbers are accurate , then you have it in you somewhere to make things happen , because back when you cared , you didn't achieve that by putting in zero effort . I'd like to see you care again and get to where you should be before you head more toward the mobility scooter breed of fattie . If you do it , you can be unbanned and join the rest of us here since you said in principle you have the same thoughts .

17029	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money .

Public transportation ( even if it is shitty in my area ) . Know what that entails ? Walking , sometimes upward to a mile , and waiting for extended periods of time . That's what I do . You do realize cities and suburbs are ideal for walking , right ? You know , with so many places within walking distance . Rural areas are where cars are a necessity . Have fun overriding the influence of land developers who buy politicians and fly private jets . Um ... Yes , there is a health industry . And guess what , it also wants to keep you fat . ...

17560	OperationPullRyan	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section <NUMBER> ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section <NUMBER> renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year <NUMBER> to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section <NUMBER> modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section <NUMBER> , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section <NUMBER> requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section <NUMBER> before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section <NUMBER> could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section <NUMBER> requires the President to submit a report to the Congress <NUMBER> days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section <NUMBER> further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section <NUMBER> , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

17644	fatpeoplehate	I'm sorry to hear that . :( Varicose veins are very preventable , make sure your limbs have good circulation ( standing up for long periods of time = bad ) and pay attention to any swelling , discoloration , weird itching , lumps or spider veins that may appear . Spider veins in an of themselves are no threat , but they're an early sign that you should be careful . It is rare that varicose veins appear and get THAT bad with no symptoms .

On a side note if saying "" equality for all "" elicits you to say "" but not them "" then maybe reevaluate why it is you hate some group of people so much that you wish to deny them rights . Equality in modern speech typically is worded in terms of gender , gender identification , creed , and race , which I hope most people would strive for as well , as long as it doesn't hurt , hinder , or otherwise diminish other peoples rights , which is where the exceptions for obese people come in . The fat acceptance ( and rad feminism ) movement in my opinion are movements designed to co-opt , deny or gain an unequal amount of rights from another group , which is why they sound so fucking crazy . I have no problem with equal rights for all but that's not what fat acceptance and sjw's are out to get . They want more rights than anyone else and if not that they want their ignorance to be publicly accepted so they don't have to deal with the cognitive dissonance behind the acknowledgement that they are living wrong or unhealthily . They're selfish basically . I would hope that nothing about a person would take away from their ability to be treated as an equal , even being fat .

17764	leagueoflegends	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around <NUMBER> to cast <NUMBER> to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an <NUMBER> mana , <NUMBER> turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip with + <NUMBER> / + <NUMBER> , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : <NUMBER> multicolored mana and <NUMBER> turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost <NUMBER> black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only .

17900	holocaust	"The "" elevator chokepoint "" argument , while true , has always struck me as fairly weak . I've always thought the same ( always as in the short time I've been obsessed with and studying this ) . That said , there are so many arguments and points that--taken on their own--are weak , for lack of a better word . However , when you look at all of them as a whole , it makes for a compelling case against traditionalists . Even without super-convincing air-tight arguments ( like no holes ... ) , a convincing case can be made . No holes , no holocaust is just icing on the cake . All that said , one of the things that draws me to the study of revisionism is the precision and meticulousness needed to be shown by revisionists and how the entire field is moved forward by people constantly pushing for more precision and more meticulousness ( as opposed to traditionalists ) . You might be ( rightly ) nitpicking , but the other side will do so much worse and attempt to discredit everything said by someone because of one misstatement . Funny that they do that , while allowing some incredible misstatements ( and also outright lies ) to be presented as "" fact "" for decades .

17932	fatpeoplehate	Without sounding too melodramatic I do believe within our lifetime we could well be in a situation where survival means something very different than it does today . ( Again ; not trying to be alarmist , just cautious given our past <NUMBER> years ) . Your post really spoke to me , but you are fortunate to have only had two planets in your group . Recently I went to Marrakesh and half of our group was unhealthily overweight . I imagine the work we were doing was much easier in comparison to yourself , which in turn attracted more lazy people . Most of the programme was spending time with kids and orphans , and to see these fat volunteers barely be able to move with the children was an embarrassing sight . Playing ' catch ' whilst immobile on the spot when everyone just wanted to run and kick a football around , or worse - sitting down in the shade waiting for physical activities to end . Even opting out of some days entire timetable because it didn't suit their energy levels . Coming back to our rooms to find four fat fuckers sun bathing and treating it like a holiday - these are just a few examples of the self entitled behaviour of , seemingly , only the fat people in our group . To bring it back to the original point .. I just wanted to agree with you massively that I would never accept an obeast into any situation where another persons safety or health was a concern . If you can't run , lift others , or even yourself - what good are you to anyone ?	EXP

Before I go further : I am a hypocrite . I've lost <NUMBER> pounds , am bottom-heavy with a body type that does not make me prone to thigh gaps , and one of my goals is to have one . I'm doing it the ( mostly ) healthy way , but having been an MFP member for a long time I somehow became the shoulder to cry on for a bunch of bulimic / anorexic teens ( I really don't know how , since I don't have an ED ) who were obsessed with thigh gaps . So I do understand how girls take it to extremes and why that is bad . That being said , I don't think thigh gaps themselves should be vilified . There are plenty of healthy women with them . But the obsession with achieving it isn't always healthy . I just think the backlash against that has somehow morphed into a "" all thigh gaps are bad "" mentality that isn't really fair ."	EXP
