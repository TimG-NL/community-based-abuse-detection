And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

360	uncensorednews	"Quit relying on statistics as a crutch to prove some kind of "" point "" . You understand you just asked me to ignore facts , right ? Anyhow , whites haven't done shit for blacks . Decades of aid to numerous African nations says otherwise , especially considering this aid has saved millions of black lives . Speaking of black lives - The standard of living for blacks in white nations is astronomically higher than anywhere else they reside . Blacks built society , inarguably . Actually that can be easily argued because their societies are dog shit , bereft of the countless luxuries you take advantage of everyday . The only reason you black violence is considered "" disproportionate "" , is because all factors of violence aren't included in statistics . You know it , and i know it . What factors ? Socioeconomic ? Oh is this where you try to justify <NUMBER> % of the population committing the majority of rape and murder by saying they're poor ? I might be able to believe this if the majority of the poor in the United States weren't white . The poorest region in the United States is the Appalachians and it is overwhelmingly white . Despite this , the Appalachians is not as dangerous as virtually every black region in the nation and again despite whites being the majority of the poor , they don't commit the majority of violent crime . The "" societies and cultures of Europeans "" aren't "" unquestionably superior "" . I can call that bullshit on that all day long , champ . Is that why you're living in one ? You speak a European language . You type away on white inventions . You use standards wrought from European minds . You survive off medicine brought into the world by European men . You are nothing without white people . All whites do is leave a trail of death , destruction , and misery in their wakes . I'm gonna cite a real-world example of this being absolutely false by bringing up Rhodesia . You know what that is ? It was a nation built by Europeans in Africa and nothing was really in the region but a few black tribes that still struggled with the concept of abstract thought . Nonetheless the European introduced an agricultural movement so stunningly efficient that it fed itself and the neighboring regions , that includes those black tribes I mentioned who had joined Rhodesia , many times over . Eventually , blacks demanded that Rhodesia be handed back to them and the leader of this movement violently usurped the whites in charge and Rhodesia became Zimbabwe . Guess what happened after that ? All that agriculture came crashing down . Rhodesia is a starving third world hell hole and the dictator Mugabe has literally begged white people to return and feed them . We leave ruin ? Destruction ? Misery ? Ha . Those things were the standard before whites came along . The fact that you think the majority of the of whites are white supremacist trash like you , makes me laugh . They're not . I'm just stating objective facts . Me ? I'm probably not superior to anyone but I'm not going to pretend white societies and their unimaginable contributions to mankind aren't superior to numerous other ones . If there were a race war to kick off like shitbag cucks like you dream about , you'd get rolled right the fuck over . People are getting sick of your primitive & insecure mentality . It would be <NUMBER> all over again . But much , much , worse on your end . You're kidding right ? You're vastly underestimating how good white people are at massacring others when they mobilize and you're probably one of those silly muds that pretends it's going to be whites vs everybody else . It won't and I have bad news for negroes - You have no friends . No other race can tolerate you like whites have and as far as the United States go ? You're <NUMBER> % of a population with most of your soldiers sitting in prison . That's not even considering how Hispanics have spent the last decade chasing blacks out where they formerly were . The future is even worse for blacks buddy and you should be grateful everyday that whites keep their head in the sand ."	EXP

Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering .

I haven't read the article yet , but she actually may be quoting an interviewee , who knows ! Plus , a lot of social scientists are very qUiRkY and like to slightly deviate from the norm but still remain professional ... this is sociology , you know .	IMP

582	sex	I was with a black guy once who was really big , but I've also been with a white guy who was very , very well-endowed . It was intense , maybe a bit painful at the beginning . I couldn't let the guy go as deep as he wanted , because the lenh was too much for my cervix to handle . Girth-wise , it can definitely cause tearing if you aren't wet enough ( either natural wetness or lots of lube ) . And don't freak out tearing . I'm not talking about needing stitches . All I got was some tiny little tears near the bottom edge of my vagina . They take about a day or two to heal . Zinc ointment helps .

697	fatpeoplehate	That's a good point without a doubt . What I think is that there will be two obvious points of pressure .

At the same time like you said <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of these people are medically buttfucked by their weight . In regards to social welfare programs , what isn't covered by tax income is financed by the sale of treasury bonds by the federal reserve . The sale of bonds also finances a part of every other federal program . So imagine a day when the Medicare bill sent from the hospitals requires so much of the income generated from the treasury that there is only enough left over to cover social security payments . And everything gets shut down temporarily like we've seen when congress delays spending bills . Unlike political shutdowns , you can't pass a law requiring people not to get sick .

I have had one best friend my whole life , and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner . Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon . I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people . Either way , i don't have anything keeping me here . Thank the gods for Reddit . Where's your mom from ? While i agree that some things are ... i dunno what the word is ... more abundant here , i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer . And frankly , i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living . Not retail at least . If i had my own farm , okay , i could see it . But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit .

Actually it really is sad . This baseless personal opinion you've asserted as somehow fact is very sad . It shows you to be more than a little unreasonable . He has brought discourse so fucking low , there should be an overwhelming amount of shame burdened on his supporters . Did he , or has the political system he's has zero part in until very recently been on a steady decline for decades ? I think you'll find its the latter . ( And Hillary as well , in a different way ) . We have two candidates giving platitudes across the nation and people are fucking loving it . How , I wish I knew . Well , with hillary it's mainly identity politics . First woman president and all that . And Trump has a populist agenda . It's not hard to figure out . Do you even know any of his policy positions ? Again , yes , I would say a medium amount . In the top <NUMBER> % of Americans understanding his plans I might gander . Doesn't say much . So you don't approve of the <NUMBER> billion he wants to give to our schools ? Or the end offshore act to get rid of tax havens ? Breaking up the time warner / att merger and other megacorperations like it ? Cutting middle class taxes by <NUMBER> % ? Do you even have an opinion on this <NUMBER> % corperate tax rate ?

977	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats .

1285	uncensorednews	In response to your ninja edit : All examples of the Old Testament , which is very much a book of history . The verses from Judges and from Deuteronomy are recounting events that occurred---they are not commands . Notice how in every one of those instances NOWHERE is anyone commanded to do these things in perpetuity . In other words , verses like these are records of events that already occurred . Unlike in Islam , they are NOT generalized commands applicable anywhere , at any time , with no expiration . You'll notice that even in the verse in Exodus where the command is from God , it has a specific target and place listed . Once that threat was eliminated , the command was thus no longer applicable . Its very specific nature prevents it from being confused as a command which is to be extended forever and always . These Old Testament verses , and many like them , recount specific events that occurred . The few ones which were commands had a specific time and place and more importantly , very clearly ended . They were applicable to that specific situation in time and are clearly delineated as so in the text . Now compare that with the Koran's generalized commands to kill unbelievers ( all non Muslims ) everywhere , forever . See the difference ? Additionally , Christians no longer live by the Old Testament . We use it as a History book and as a book which pointed to the coming of Jesus Christ . If you want to use verses to compare with Islam , use the New Testament . Additionally , you're missing the forest for the trees when you ignore the reality that in Islam , the Muslims are the executors of Allah's wrath whereas in Christianity , God is the judge and Christians are only His messengers . I hope you can see the very clear differences at least between Islam and Christianity .	EXP

1587	uncensorednews	Paywall so Poland triggered a showdown between eastern and western Europe yesterday when its MPs voted to give parliament the power to appoint supreme court judges , despite the threat of sanctions from Brussels . The European Commission had warned that the legislation would undermine the separation of judicial and political powers , seen as a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law . On Wednesday it gave Poland a week to rethink the plans and to avoid sanctions : the suspension of its full EU membership by the withdrawal of its voting rights , a measure that has never been used against a member state . Thousands of people protested against the legislation in Warsaw yesterday , many waving EU flags This enraged the Polish government , which yesterday won the backing of Hungary to resist European officials . Tensions have been running high in some of the former communist nations , which are resisting the EU ’ s insistence that every member state must take a share of refugees . The latest dispute began when Poland ’ s ruling Law and Justice Party rushed through a bill proposed only last week to give the justice minister the power to appoint judges to the supreme court . Further powers for the minister to organise the work of the court and decide which judges should remain were switched to the president under an amendment last night designed to make it more palatable to Brussels . The bill quickly followed one that was approved last week , giving parliament control over the National Council of the Judiciary . Jaroslaw Kaczynski , leader of Law and Justice party , sits at the centre of the front row as his party votes to pass the controversial measureJaroslaw Kaczynski , leader of Law and Justice party , sits at the centre of the front row as his party votes to pass the controversial measure “ Collectively , they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government , ” Frans Timmermans , vice-president of the commission , said , adding that the changes would “ considerably increase the systemic threat to the rule of law ” . Polish MPs voted by <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> , with <NUMBER> abstentions , to pass the bill and send it to the upper house today , where it is certain to pass thanks to the Law and Justice Party ’ s majority there . The final step to becoming law will be the signature of President Duda , a lawyer who used to be a Law and Justice MP , but who ran as an independent for the presidency in <NUMBER> . Crowds gathered in Warsaw last night calling for him to veto the bill . Donald Tusk , the former prime minister of Poland who is now president of the European Council , called for a solution to a “ very serious situation ” . He said that he has proposed a meeting with Mr Duda to try to avoid “ bleak outcomes which could ultimately lead to the marginalisation of Poland in Europe ” . He added : “ They transport us , in the political sense , in time and in space backwards and eastwards and ruin an already tarnished public opinion of Polish democracy . ” Mr Duda ’ s office said the president had rejected the offer of a meeting with Mr Tusk . During yesterday ’ s debate , Adam Bodnar , Poland ’ s human rights ombudsman , told parliament that the legislation would “ deprive citizens of the right to an independent court ” , adding : “ We are planting an explosive under our judiciary . ” Law and Justice said that it wanted to shake up the top court because it had become a “ state within a state ” and lacked accountability . It was heavily criticised for making political appointments to the constitutional court in <NUMBER> , but escaped EU censure . Jaroslaw Kaczynski , chairman of the party , said that “ far-reaching , radical actions ” were required because the judiciary had not been reformed since communist times and was inefficient . Opposition politicians , judges and European officials criticised the vote . Grzegorz Schetyna , head of Civic Platform , the main opposition party , denounced the bill as an “ announcement of a coup ” . Malgorzata Gersdorf , president of the supreme court , said that the bill would transform it into a “ court attached to the justice ministry ” . She added : “ This is very dangerous for the political system we are living in . ” Krystian Markiewicz , president of Iustitia , the Polish judges ’ association , also described the proposed change to the law as a “ coup ” . “ The rule of law and democracy are ending , the independence of powers is over , ” Mr Markiewicz said . “ The minister will appoint the judges that he favours . ” He added that the measure was introduced “ at night , completely out of the blue , with no social consultation ” and “ does not fit into EU standards ” . Hungary said that it stood by Poland and warned the commission not to meddle in Poland ’ s internal affairs . Peter Szijjarto , the Hungarian foreign minister , added : “ We stand by Poland and we call on the European Commission not to overstep its authority . ” Mr Timmermans said on Wednesday that the commission could invoke Article <NUMBER> of the EU treaties , which could lead to voting rights in the Council of the European Union being suspended . The article was set up to hold countries accountable for human rights violations , but the ultimate step of suspension would require unanimity , with Hungary unlikely to support the move . Interesting comment I wonder how many commenting on the current crisis in Poland have the first-hand knowledge of the issues and how many speak to the language to understand what this battle is really about . This article misses a few very important facts as it doesn't make it clear that the opposition party who lost the last elections ie the Civic Platform have a large and powerful representation in Brussels and Donald Tusk and friends make it very difficult for the current government to reform the institutions of the state that were never working under the previous government . For many years the judges were politically appointed and no one bat an eyelid ! Suddenly this is a problem when the new government tries to formalise the practice . This article fails to mention a number of financial frauds that have rocked the country recently which prompted the reform of the judiciary and the legal system . As I understand thousands of investors lost their deposits and government-owned property was misappropriated with the full knowledge and cooperation of the legal profession . While the Civic Platform was in power these crimes were never investigated and the judiciary actively prevented anyone from probing any further . Why this is never reported here ? All we get is the photos of protests and no explanation whether the legal system in Poland has ever functioned at all ?	EXP

1696	fatpeoplehate	I'm male , I will support equality of the sexes until the end of time , but like many other males , the vast majority of my experiences with feminism have been extremely negative .

I further made the mistake of attending two women's studies courses with stimulating lectures on why all males should be castrated , how men are the root of all societal evils , and how women cannot be sexist . Any sort of rational argument or statistic was dismissed immediately as a ' social construct . ' Words were redefined until they lost all meaning . Any attempt at presenting a differing viewpoint was met with abject hostility and insults . I've lost count of the number of times I've been called patriarch - - one of which was for the injustice of offering to carry the books of a girl who was limping around on crutches . It wasn't until I discovered reddit that I ran into feminists who I considered reasonable and actually seemed interested in equality . I feel bad for said feminists because what was once a great movement has been hijacked by lunatics . To those feminists on reddit , I ask how do you feel about this ? Do you ever wonder why so many males seem to have a complete aversion to feminism ? Either we're all raging misogynists , or there's something very wrong with feminism as a movement .

1703	pics	"few facts , rather than quoting unnecessarily and extensively Granted from wikipedia , but the article is accurate , well-sourced and conservative . I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

"" ( However , the range is more close to <NUMBER> % - <NUMBER> % ) Running in the aerobic range is a very efficient way to burn calories . it converts triglycerides into ( eventually ) ATP for muscle work . The conversion is direct and the muscle then don't require creatine phosphate , lactate , glycogen , or blood glucose to function . Running in a higher range like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % ( Lactate Range ) bypasses the aerobic zone . ATP , Creatine , glucose and glycogen all get used as lactate levels rise . Your muscles then also use the lactate as a secondary fuel . Fat conversion is minimal during the workout .

But I wasn't clear on my intent with the post ; mobile posting on the train isn't the easiest . Scenario <NUMBER> : aerobic zone . You exercise , <NUMBER> calories lost . You feel worked , but not overly so . Your body did a good job efficiently burning fat . your muscles shouldn't be sore ( assuming you are used to them being used ) because there isn't any real energy recovery necessary . If you were to eat right now , your body would treat the meal as a normal meal . Everything will go where it normally goes . After this type of exercise , your body has no deficit within the muscles or liver , so it doesn't feel stressed . Scenario <NUMBER> : Threshold zone . you exercise , <NUMBER> calories lost . You feel worked and well worked . Your body didn't convert much fat directly It used mostly blood blood glucose and muscle glycogen for the energy needs . Your muscles are a little tender as a result of this internal deficit . Your liver is a little low on glycogen and your muscles are near-depleted . Blood glucose is currently being replenished by fat conversion . If you eat now , your body will attempt to bank simple sugars , carbohydrates , fat , and then protein , from the meal , directly into the muscle tissues and liver . fat conversion stops as blood glucose levels rise . The biggest difference is how you feel afterwards . feeling more worked in a shorter amount ( scenario <NUMBER> ) of time tends to increase appetite immediately because of the drop in blood glucose over a short period . Scenario <NUMBER> keeps Glucose levels more steady over the training period ( no spike or drop . ) The net result is that you will feel less hungry after the first workout than the second workout ( for most people . ) The only thing the exercise can't fix is the habit / desire to eat too much regardless .

2118	milliondollarextreme	good point about fractional reserve banking but thats more of a problem with that and not traders , right ? A lot of these types of problems come up with libertarians that make one have to take seemingly paradoxical views sometimes . like gay marriage for example , or debt based issues , or social programs , because these issues come from the current system , and so you cannot insert extensions of a libertarian system in a system which is not libertarian . for example as a libertarian i don't care about how much money we spend as country , because obviously it doesn't matter given the monetary and finance system , the national debt can't be paid off even remotely . It is designed for it to increase exponentially . It's either dismantle the system entirely or don't care . you can't insert libertarian shit within it because it makes no sense . I'm not so sure I understand what your idea is of what can legally be done to change it ? as for HFT , i don't understand your point really . i don't get how it's a toll booth . it's just buying and selling on a micro-scale . Basically , i don't get what you're advocating other than statist regulations . With reality , the list of complaints are endless . doesn't violate rights . that's barely something to care about . Is that really a problem as you suggest ? That an investor has to pay a little more because of the volatility of traders ?

2135	fatpeoplehate	"It depends upon your friend circle , and where you are honestly . Hams cannot understand the concept of not shoveling down large portions of food . Most of them probably never even stop to think that most meals at many restaurants are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> times bigger than they should be portion wise . The life of a fatty is centered around food . Every part of the day is centered around shoveling food into their mouth . So the idea of someone eating a small portion , or sharing something that they could eat several of is very foreign . I think that is partly why they feel the need to speak up but the other part is just crabs in bucket mentality . They have to try to drag others down to be like them . All you can do is ignore them . People who lack the self control to know when to stop eating are hardly in any right state to remark on the habits of others food wise . Actually , it can be kind of damaging having people constantly harp on you about eating so little . You can get over it of course . I used to think several years back there was something seriously wrong with me . I'd watch all these people eat "" Normal "" portions and here I am needing to order off the kid's menu because I cannot stomach the full feeling , or finish what most people around me can . I used to get so anxious about how I was treated I never wanted to go out and eat . It was so embarrassing to constantly be singled out due to eating so little at the table . Then one day I realized that what I was doing was actually more normal , and that the so called "" Normal portions "" were in fact abnormal .

2140	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

2233	europeannationalism	I am a National Socialist , and I'd be happy to explain what that means . National Socialism is a bit of a misnomer since it was used during a time Socialism could refer to any ideology that appeals to the interests of the workers , while not necessarily being a Pro-class struggle or Communist ideology . It would be more accurate to call National Socialism a Corporatist ideology . Like other forms of Fascism , National Socialism advocates for a system that protects private property and allows for a market economy , but the State promotes and ensures that there is class unity as opposed to class struggle , healthy class relations that are beneficial for all involved . NS is in favor of Nationalism and ethnocentrism . We believes that every nation's and every race's autonomy should be preserved . This doesn't mean every nation is isolated from each other , but National Socialism is against globalism and globalization . Foreigners are allowed to exist within a NS nation , but they have to respect the society they are in and follow the law of foreigners . The interests of the nation and society are held deeply . We advocate for a one-party meritocratic government that chooses and promotes leaders based on their competence and gives them accountability proportionate to the power they hold . National Socialism opposes the Liberal concept of democracy , but this does not mean we're against all forms of voting and other citizen participation in government . The Third Reich itself held multiple plebiscites and citizens were empowered to become involved in their communities . Society in general will be built around meritocracy . The amount of effort and good you produce will determine what you get from society . There will be incentives for people to improve their bodies , their minds , and their communities . There will be incentives for those who benefit their communities , and their nation directly or indirectly . These incentives will likely come in the form of access to additional social services and other benefits . Aside from that , there are many different interpretations of National Socialism . If you have any questions , feel free to ask me . I'll even suggest you some additional reading if you want more in-depth perspectives related to National Socialism . Let me know if you need more recommendations . Suggested Reading - Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler This is mostly a biographical look at Hitler's life and his political views , it's a long read and is in a conversational tone that may be hard to read . However , it may help you understand Adolf Hitler a little more . The Programme of the NSDAP by Gottfried Feder This is a good book for the actual politics of the NSDAP . It outlines the social , political , and economic foundation of National Socialism in Germany . I highly recommend it . White Power by George Lincoln Rockwell This is a good book for learning about Rockwell's post-war interpretation of National Socialism and is a decent introduction to the American strain of NS in general . National Socialism : Vanguard of the Future by Colin Jordan . This is another book written after World War II and the subsequent fall of the German Reich . It's a collection of several essays on the topic of Germany and National Socialism . Who We Are by William Luther Pierce Another good piece of literature on the topic of National Socialism , in general I'd recommend Pierce's work . He sometimes goes under the pen name Andrew Macdonald , so just be aware of that .	EXP

2350	holocaust	"Works for me . I'll paste the text here . - - - - - - - - - The Jerusalem Post ( <NUMBER> August <NUMBER> ) article about Krakowski and the Yad Vashem Archives was by the reporter Barbara Amouyal , who wrote that the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem hold <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> such testimonies of "" Holocaust survivors "" . Its director at the time , Shmuel Krakowski , is quoted by Amouyal as declaring that over half are "" unreliable . . . . Many were never in the places where they claim to have witnessed atrocities , while others relied on second-hand information given them by friends or passing strangers . . . . A large number of testimonies on file were later proved inaccurate when locations and dates could not pass an expert historian's appraisal . "" Jamie McCarthy has pointed out to me a subsequent development I overlooked . Krakowski wrote a letter in reply , published on <NUMBER> August ( p . <NUMBER> ) , in which he complained "" I said there are some - fortunately very few - testimonies , which proved to be inaccurate . Why did Amouyal make them out to be a large number ? "" Krakowski did not indicate what changes should be made in the quoted remarks ; e . g . he did not write that he said there were "" very few "" , only that there were very few . It seems unlikely that the problem of fanciful testimonies in the Archives would have come up at all , during the interview , unless it was somehow a pressing practical problem , quite apart from numbers ( "" some "" vs . "" a large number "" ) . Indeed the context of the Amouyal article shows that it was . At the time , Amouyal was covering the forthcoming Demjanjuk trial . Retired Cleveland auto worker John Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian immigrant , had been extradited from the USA in <NUMBER> to stand trial in Israel , accused of being "" Ivan the Terrible "" of Treblinka , who had allegedly gassed hundreds of thousands of Jews there . The trial was held in <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> in Jerusalem . The Amouyal report was written in the context of preparations for the Demjanjuk trial . She mentioned specific testimonies in the Archives of three people who had testified in Demjanjuk's denaturalization hearing in the USA , of whom two , Eliyahu Rosenberg and Pinhas Epstein , were to testify in the Jerusalem trial . Krakowski , for his part , mentioned in the interview one specific class of "" not entirely credible "" testimony ( a quote not contradicted in his August <NUMBER> letter ): "" survivor testimony claiming that Ivan the Terrible was killed in the Treblinka uprising of August <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> "" . Both Epstein and Rosenberg identified Demjanjuk as "" Ivan "" in the Jerusalem trial . Epstein claimed that he recognized Ivan's "" familiar gait as television showed Demjanjuk walking down the gangway from his plane "" ( London weekly Jewish Chronicle , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> , p <NUMBER> ) , and testified to various gory atrocities by Demjanjuk that he had allegedly witnessed ( NY Times , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> ) . Eliyahu Rosenberg was the star witness against Demjanjuk in the Jerusalem trial , and also identified him as "" Ivan "" . Rather early , it was revealed that in <NUMBER> Rosenberg had given a deposition in which he claimed that "" Ivan "" had been killed by inmates in August <NUMBER> ( NY Times , <NUMBER> Feb . <NUMBER> ) . He attempted to explain this by claiming that his <NUMBER> statement had actually been based on hearsay , and was erroneous . Late in the trial , however , defense lawyers produced a document , handwritten in Yiddish by Rosenberg for a Warsaw historical institute in <NUMBER> , declaring that he had personally participated in the killing of Ivan in August <NUMBER> , and identifying the immediate killer as one "" Gustav "" ( Cleveland Plain Dealer , <NUMBER> & <NUMBER> Jan . <NUMBER> , Chicago Tribune , <NUMBER> Jan . <NUMBER> ) . With some circumlocution of these and other matters the court found Demjanjuk guilty and sentenced him to death . However it subsequently became obvious to the whole world that Demjanjuk could not have been a guard at Treblinka . Consequently in <NUMBER> , despite all the lying testimonies of <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , he was acquitted and released . He then returned to the USA . The relevant observation for us is that when the Israeli prosecution attempted to use witnesses who had supplied testimonies for the Yad Vashem Archives , the results were those predictable from the Amouyal article , and worse . The sense of the original article was completely confirmed by subsequent events . That sense is that the testimonies in the Archives are essentially "" unreliable "" for practical purposes . In one way or another , regardless of whether he said "" some "" or "" many "" , Krakowski transmitted that idea to the reporter . If Krakowski does not want to take credit for being right , that is his problem , not ours . In journalism it is commonplace for a subject to regret the candor with which he gave an earlier interview . When Demjanjuk's acquittal as "" Ivan "" was confirmed one Esther Raab , who had been silent when Demjanjuk was alleged to have been at Treblinka , popped up to offer her testimony that she recalled Demjanjuk from her stay at Sobibor . The New York Times commented ( <NUMBER> August <NUMBER> ) that "" It is unclear why Mrs . Raab did not speak out until now . "" On the contrary , it is completely clear . I assume her testimony also reposed at Yad Vashem ; if not , her role as a technical advisor for the <NUMBER> TV movie Escape from Sobibor establishes her testimony as being of equal ostensible worth . These matters are "" historiographically important "" . last modification : <NUMBER> May <NUMBER> ."	EXP

Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

If multiculturalism benefits everyone , why don't we multiculturalize some nations that need help ? Oh that's right , because multiculturalism is only pushed on white nations , everyone else is allowed to maintain homogeneous countries . If you haven't noticed , America is on the verge of a fucking race war . This does not bode well for your claim that multiculturalism is a success . Culture is ethnic . You cannot separate the two . Look at the self-segregation that is naturally happening in America if you need proof of this . Go to Japan , see what they think of multiculturalism . See how they feel about other Asians living there . See how they feel about hafus who are born there to one Japanese parent , if they are considered Japanese . This is not a foreign concept . And no , white men did not purchase and bring over African slaves . Every single one of those slave ships were Jewish owned and operated . As for the native Americans , they were not a monolithic people . They were many separate tribes who were at war with each other , killing their own kind , forming alliances with the settlers to fight neighboring tribes . ( Unless you believe they just materialized horses out of thin air . ) Well when somebody shows up who was better at war and your numbers were too small to occupy the amount of land that is being disputed , contains so infastructure and isn't being used for anything , not hard to imagine the result . At first you wanted the Irish out I never said that . They are Europeans so they fit into a country founded by Europeans . The immigration act of <NUMBER> was the last nail in the coffin for America . Since then we've gone from <NUMBER> % white to <NUMBER> % . Do you see what is happening ? The economy is unstable , cost of living is rising , social tensions are mounting ... And for what , so we can have cheap labor and authentic tacos ? If these people are such a boon to society , they need to be in their homelands so they can fix their countries for their children , not leaving it to burn so they can benefit from a society that somebody else created . Perhaps America was destined to fall . Even cohesion between different European cultures doesn't happen naturally . Sometimes I wish my ancestors never left Europe . I wish I had an older culture to live with . I love American culture , but it is a departure from what I could have had . Working against ethnonationalism benefits no one , no matter how you'd like it to be true . ( By the way , you just said "" it benefits everyone "" and then don't give any reasons why . But moving on . ) No race is a master but of it's own domain . Every people have the right to maintain a homogenous homeland so their people may carve their own destinies free from foreign influence , and maintain their history ancestry and culture ."	EXP

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

I heard them talking to the front desk guy about the place , cue attempted flirting , and then ask if they actually had to wear climbing shoes after the rentals struggled to fit on to their fat feet . He told them it wasn't necessarily required and they went on their way to the walls . I saw them a couple times around and each time they would really just be climbing up the walls , not using the paths or problems and they took so much time that it just created a group of people waiting for them to finish . I heard one of them comment how easy climbing was and that's when I had it . I went up to them and told them that you want to stay on the obviously color coded path in order to do the problem correctly . They looked so confused but then they attempted to try it . Luckily they were on a V2 and failed miserably , couldn't even get up from the start . They eventually left defeated but not before taking some selfies . You would think they would actually try to research a bit about climbing before coming it to attempt it but hams are too lazy and they just want that instant gratification of looking like they exercise .

3225	uncensorednews	I hear you , a lot of people haven't been exposed to that kind of epidemic . However a closer inspection by the medical community reveals that people don't really ' OD ' on cocaine but have long term cardiac disease , similar to fried chicken . The majority of deaths in the cocaine trade , by FAR , is violence between drug sellers . Heroin is a horrible evil addiction and overdosing is a real possibility . However many overdoses occur because of the wide spectrum of potency . Some heroin is so supplemented with other ( dangerous ) stuff that the user barely gets high ; and some is so powerful it will kill the user . Not knowing the potency of the drug is what leads to many overdoses . There are also the many longer term health effects of intravenous heroin use , often caused by sharing needles and using poor venipunture technique . A heroin user with a steady supply of consistent heroin who uses good aseptic technique can live a long time ( William Burroughs ) , not that that seems like a happy life . My point is that if you really hate the deaths and lives wrecked by drugs close inspection will reveal their illegality is a leading factor .

It was my first time on top , and I was bouncing hard , like they show on porn . Unfortunately , he wasn't that big . He slipped out , I heard a crack as I bounced back down HARD . I hit him so hard , my pelvis connected with his , regardless of his penis being in the way . He screamed and threw me off of him , beginning to cry . I didn't know a penis could make that sort of snapping noise . Long story short , his penis turned black and purple . It bends the other way now . We got married this September . <URL> Pretty much what it looked like . Warning , NSFL . I'd also like to mention that I did attempt to give him a blowjob while he was healing , instead of having sex ( THAT was interesting ) .	NOT

Lets talk about misinformation . You said ' Rich had no security clearance to access those emails . ' Well the DNC isnt part of the government and their arent classified . Two . I have never heard about rich testifying against anyone . Three . You state that wikileaks is somehow working for the Russians . This is a political talking point , not backed up by any proof . Four . Just the phrase "" Russian hacker cabal "" makes you sound like a shareblue employee . The media keeps calling a ' hack ' and you point to Rich's lack of computer engineering expertise ; the fact is that the DNC emails werent hacked , they were leaked . The difference being that no one lost control of their account , not DoSs type attack broke their passwords , no one knew who's emails were stole in the first place . Five . We can know for sure how those emails came off the DNC server because they DNC never let the FBI inspect it . Why is that ? Six . John Podesta's emails werent ' hacked ' by some Russian cabal either . He fell for a fishing scheme and gave his password to someone , who then changed it . If you look at the hacks that are happening right now over seas , you can see the different . The media is being lazy and calling it hacked but there is no proof of that .

Although , It has become increasingly important for them to bang this pot to deflect why Rich may have been murdered and to forward the war hawking against Russia . If you're not familiar with the story here's a very brief update : Rich is alleged to be the DNC leaker . Assange has stated that no State actor is the leaker and alluded several times that Rich was the leaker . Rich was murdered shortly before Wikileaks published the leaked data showing that Sanders was railroaded by the DNC . The murder was called a ' robbery ' ( to deflect the real reason he was killed ? ) . None of Rich's thousands of dollars worth of person effects were stolen . After the DNC data was published , the DNC claimed they were ' hacked ' , denied the FBI access to investigate several times at multiple levels of requests by the FBI . The DNC brought in a private cybersecurity firm that has a penchant for attributing breaches to "" muh Russia "" that have later been found to be false . The private firm finds that the DNC was hacked by "" muh Russia "" . [ If you want a in depth analysis then you can watch this . ] ( <URL> It is + <NUMBER> minutes , but provides verifiable links to information . Personally , I've been loosely following the story . It seemed plausible . However , lately evidence has been mounting in the last few days as the 4chan autists have been focusing their attention on finding more information . I don't buy the editing of these posts for "" doxing "" simply because if that was the case then these posts on Reddit would likely have been edited before they were archived and then posted as evidence that megrimlock was Rich . Remember this isn't the first time that Reddit has been caught altering evidence . Remember stonetear whose posts , once they were brought to light by 4chan autists , became subject of an FBI investigation . Yeah , Reddit deleted those too long after a user could delete them on their own . Now we have a dead man editing his post . Fuck Reddit . Fuck spez ."	EXP

Herd immunity is maintained thus destroying the pathogen before it can go multi-generational . Because you see , when lets say a virus or bacteria is introduced into an immunized population , it is killed off and that's that . But if you bring in a population that is not immunized , due to rich people thinking they are smarter than doctors or , primarily , illegals coming to the usa without even a health screening , you get a nice petri dish for the diseases to hang out in and every day they expose people to these viruses and with each generation the viruses have a chance to mutate and adapt to the immunity . Inevitably , one of these will adapt , and then comes the fun part . Antibiotic and vaccine resistant strains running around unchecked in illegal communities , being exposed to all the places theu go . Grocery stores , restaurants , schools , convenience stores ...

4217	sjwhate	"I never said "" modern "" leftist . You did . You falsely attributed that to me , called it wrong thus creating a principle for consistency , and then immediately ignored that very principle thus being logically inconsistent . You yourself claimed that I was wrong by claiming that I attributed modern leftism to the founding fathers ( and that this isn't accurately descriptive ) , then you yourself attributed modern Libertarianism to the founding fathers . The founding fathers were mostly leftists by virtue of being left of center . Many of the features of their ideology and the tenets in their writings are still leftist , and were mostly leftist for the time period . Those Libertarian features you are seeing ? Those were left of center in <NUMBER> . I . e . , leftist . Many ideals you would consider conservative today were leftist then . As you yourself said , modern leftism has changed . I don't think you realized how , because only one of your examples encompasses a minority of leftist ideologies ( "" pro-socialist policies "" ) . And , believe it or not , expanding the role of federal government into people's lives is also a very Fascist belief , with the understanding that people are naturally irrational and need government control . Fascism is very , very conservative , yet it's also leftist ? You're also taking a very naive view of conservativism . These aren't just political ideologies ; you can't compare conservatism's social aspects to liberalism's financial aspects , for example , and call it an accurate comparison . Conservatives ( of which Liberatarians are a part of , not a complimentary group or some such nonsense like you seem to think ) care very much about morality , as does literally every other person , everywhere . Modern conservatives care about the Constitution , but the ideas the ideology is founded on existed long before the Constitution . Protection of minority rights from majority rule is the single most basic tenet of conservatism , contrasted with the leftist idea of supporting the majority . Realism ( vs idealism ) , and traditionalism are other basic and so far unchanged tenets . Would you call the founding fathers realists ? Traditionalists ? Did they protect the minority opinion from the majority ? You could say they did in the sense that they wanted religious freedom , and then say they didn't in the sense that itself was a majority opinion . Traditionalism has resulted in different features in different cultures too ; for example , liberal economics are seen as conservative in the U . S . because the U . S . was originally and traditionally liberal economically . Christian moral theory and adherence to the constitution are features of U . S . conservatives due to tradition as well . Some features that are attributed to conservatives are really just conservative political parties taking opposing sides on issues to spite other parties ; gun control is both a far left and far right policy , for similar reasons : an armed populace is tough to oppress . So , to sum it up , you only gave a single leftist tenet in your examples , and that suffers from the same problem as we had before : modern Socialism isn't the same as it was when it was in its infancy , right around the time of the revolution . At the time it was the belief that there needs to be some minimum level of control over mercantilism , precursor to modern capitalism . As the majority of the founding fathers were Federalists , they can be said to have supported similar ideas though I do not know if they were explicitly aware of the existence of Socialism . While not declaring whether they ( the Federalist Party ) were primarily left or right , they were supportive of a mercantile economy as an alternative to the existing plantation-based economy , but they also supported the idea of a strong federal government so that states wouldn't be forced to individually deal with their own or other states ' problems ( and economic bullshit ) . Starting to sound less like the ideology you know and love ? Actually , this polarization we see today didn't even become a thing until the mid-twentieth century . Party loyalty was nearly nonexistent , and parties weren't measured on a right-left axis outside adademia . But something you should note is that today's liberals become tomorrow's conservatives . Your views were once further left than they currently are , because leftists love change and conservatives hate it . I'm deliberately using "" leftist "" instead of "" liberal "" for most of this too , because while liberals are leftist , leftists aren't necessarily liberal and there are some very distinct and disturbing non-liberal ideologues in leftism . I personally believe the right-left axis , or newer double axis , isn't adequate to measure the difference in direction of most ideals anymore , as Social Justice Theory is no friend of Liberalism ."

Maybe take your information from a source other than tongue in cheek memes about periods lol Were you aware that men also have fluctuating hormone levels that can cause them to , by your standards , be unstable human beings . As a human your hormones aren't at a constant , perfectly balanced level your whole life . Yes , Germany has a female chancellor and they are experiencing an immigration crisis . Just like a lot of Europe , as you pointed out . I'm pretty sure the rest of those political leaders are men , though . So it's specifically just women's "" fault "" , regardless of the fact that men are still making these decisions in the majority of countries . That actually makes sense to you ? Just to reiterate , literally every woman voted for these guys / one girl , not one man voted for them ? And the men enacting these policies aren't a problem . Just the female voters . It's even more ridiculous that you completely look right past the basic issue of the immigration crisis . Who are we concerned about in the immigrant demographic ? Women and children ? No ? Oh yeah , it's the men that are the problem . In fact , let's take a look back at history . Who started all the wars , genocides , mass slaughterings etc . Biology says that men are more violent , maybe men shouldn't be allowed to vote or hold public office . I mean , history backs me up . Men cause too much bloodshed and are too focused on violence to effectively run a country . Yup , women should just run the world . That's just a ridiculous way to think , it honestly blows my mind that you actually think these things ? Like you're not just trolling ? I could keep going on and actually put effort into my reply , but I'm not <NUMBER> % sure you're actually serious . I can't believe I actually took this time to reply to you . Keep your hilariously sad opinion , obviously I'm not gong to change your mind . Maybe when you actually meet a few women irl you'll grow up . I don't have much hope for you , though . That being said , I hope it makes you incredibly uncomfortable knowing that a woman will be the chief engineer of a nuclear power plant , ready to literally and figuratively melt down because muh hormones ."

No , that's not even remotely close to what I'm saying . I'm saying that any legislation passed in the name of "" the needs of the many "" should never happen if the needs of the many require the violation of the rights of others . I don't believe people who are confused about the genitals have a right to pick and choose which bathroom they use when it's commonly accepted that you go into the one that aligns with your plumbing , so it's kind of irrelevant in this case . In the democratic process , when passing new laws and new legislation , the argument "" It doesn't affect you "" simply isn't good enough . That's what most tyrants say , and since America has devolved into a nation of meddlesome busybodies who want to tell everyone else what to do this sort of thing is hardly surprising even if it terribly disappointing .

Sure . I totally get that and it sounds great . On the other hand you could argue that this normalizes or in some way condones the theological positions of Islam , which is offensive to many people . Both side's raise a valid point because it's going to have a different effect on different people . I like how people pretend like they care about women's rights and freedom when they post stuff like this Well a lot of people seem to be doing so , but I'll just come out and say that I really don't care in the slightest . If they want to adhere to beliefs that restrict their personal liberty , economic growth and quality of life then I see no reason why we should make any effort to interfere . but they're actually just using it as an excuse to hate on Islam and Muslims . I don't need an excuse to hate on Islam . It's theology is repulsive and it's history isn't much better . I take issue with Muslims based on that fact , though I don't hate them for it . The same way I take issue with evangelical Christians . Their theology is shaky and their beliefs are somewhat annoying . I don't see why anyone would make a differentiation here . This isn't a sub that's about elevating anyone it's about fighting the imaginary SJW boogieman that only exists when you have the internet to see the worst examples of them . Yes .

4922	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

5164	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

5208	fatpeoplehate	I'm not a truck person at all , so I had to make some guesses and look up some stuff .

These are all half-ton trucks , so their max payload is obviously <NUMBER> lbs . I think we can assume these hams are at least <NUMBER> each , so the truck would be capable of safely carrying them if they were evenly distributed through the bed . Instead , their weight is all on the tailgate , out past the rear axle . For this , I think the to win maximum tongue weight is most appropriate . For the layman , this describes how well a trailer is balanced over its own wheels . Basically , you want the truck dragging the trailer , not necessarily lifting it . For these <NUMBER> trucks , I got a ballpark of <NUMBER> lb maximum tongue weight . It's safe to say that driving the poor little truck that could in this condition would cause permanent and severe damage to the rear suspension and drivetrain . Statically , obviously the drivetrain is safe . The suspension is likely experiencing accelerated wear due to these hammies getting on and off to go get food , etc , but not as bad as if it were carting them over bumps and whatnot . I think it's safe to say that the real hero in this picture is the little steel cable that holds the tailgate up . Hold on little buddy !

The Jewish people , in modern times , have obtained a sort of impenetrable social armor--you can't criticize the doings of the Jewish state without criticizing the Jewish religion it's based upon . And you can't criticize the Jewish religion because it is the inherited birthright of the Jewish race . The typical gentile knows very little about the Jewish people and this is by design . They teach us in school that the Jewish people are simply just another religion--people who celebrate different holidays like Hanukkah in winter time . The story of Hanukkah itself is often whitewashed for the gentiles , to make us forget that Hannukah is the story of a barbaric , savage revolt of Jews against the Seleucid Empire . The ZOG has conditioned us to associate the dislike , criticism and even the mentioning of Jewish things with the provocative HOLOCAUST : trade_mark : propaganda they showed shoah'ed us in grade school . When you juxtapose the amount of attention the Holocaust receives in media and education with that of the Holodomor , it is very clear that there is an unjust Jewish bias .	EXP

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

5724	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

5965	magicTCG	Did a lot of those people who complained play netdecks ? That is often an issue . When I make my own decks , I get irritated losing to netdeck players . Netdeck players also get REALLY upset if I beat them with something that I obviously made up , as they feel , I tihnk , that they spent more time researching and learning the best decks and if they lose to ' jank ' , then it was just luck . Conversely , if I lose to someone who also made their own deck ... I am happy to lose , or at least , as happy as I will ever be losing . On cockatrice I chat away with people who make their own decks , and congratulate them when they win . Vs net deck players I often rage quit . :/	NOT

5978	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

5979	fatpeoplehate	Dude , something can be funny to people and still be racist they aren't mutually exclusive . I've laughed at racist jokes before . But yeah , people do make fun of how they write there , it's kind of obvious when they make post titles in Ebonics poking fun at the subject of the tweet . I don't really care it doesn't affect me but to say it isn't racist is just self deluding . To act like that sub is some friendly utopia where all are welcome and all in good fun while fatpeoplehate is somehow below them is what pissed me off . To ban people who participate here from posting over there pissed me off . I'm not taking the subs content seriously , I'm taking the hypocritical moderating seriously . So when that asshat said it isn't racist , I simply asked him if he'd share that page with prominent black people . The sad thing is I have found posts there funny before too before it got swarmed , but I'm going to be characterised as taking this too seriously when I was simply pointing out bullshit where I saw it .

5981	politics	Saying a country has a small population as a reason why their policies won't work here is just being intellectually lazy . Yeah , some things might not work , but it doesn't make it so for every social program . For example , single payer health insurance is superior in every single way over our current for-profit health insurance . Insurance works better over the largest pool of people . So having everyone on single payer is better than having huge gaps in insurance coverage . But , I am betting by your ugh is that you are already completely closed minded about this .
