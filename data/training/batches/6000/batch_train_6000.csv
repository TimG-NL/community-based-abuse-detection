1	fatpeoplehate	Good god , that's horrible . And I've been to / r / wtf , but this is scarier . I only hope the poor girl hits a growth spurt when she gets into her teens , and grows into that loose skin . Still , looks like her skeletal structure got messed up too , by the way she moves when she walks , so that is probably permanent . That's really criminal , to do that to a child .	EXP

7	fatpeoplehate	It's because people are both smart and idiotic . Everyone is different in different areas of life and most of our encounters with people tend to be outside their field of expertise / comfort and we end up seeing them in a way that they don't see themselves . It's also because there is just a portion of the population that is really , really dumb and they're usually more sociable because they don't have the smarts to hold back , show some restraint nor the wisdom to learn from their past social mistakes and so they continually go through life thinking they've done no wrong .

17	sex	I was with a black guy once who was really big , but I've also been with a white guy who was very , very well-endowed . It was intense , maybe a bit painful at the beginning . I couldn't let the guy go as deep as he wanted , because the lenh was too much for my cervix to handle . Girth-wise , it can definitely cause tearing if you aren't wet enough ( either natural wetness or lots of lube ) . And don't freak out tearing . I'm not talking about needing stitches . All I got was some tiny little tears near the bottom edge of my vagina . They take about a day or two to heal . Zinc ointment helps . EDITED TO ADD : Assuming , of course , that the guy has a big dick . He might not and this might all be a moot point . If the guy is considerate , it should be possible to work something out that is mutually pleasurable .	NOT
18	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	These are my husband's food groups , sweet and salty . His cholesterol is bad , but not the way you'd think . Because he's got Crohn's Disease and is missing half his large and a third of his small intestine food goes through him like shit through a goose , so to speak . He takes handfuls of Colestid pills to slow down his gut . This further reduces his cholesterol . Last time he had it checked his total cholesterol was <NUMBER> .

33	fatpeoplehate	I guess this is becoming the music industry's new tactic when they're trying to create an image for an artist who has average or below average looks . Meghan's too plain to be made into a sex icon , but not hideous enough to not be marketable . They've figured out there's this demographic for loud and proud girl power fat types ( fucking Adele ) and so she fits perfectly in that mold . I think she'll most likely end up hating being considered the singer of the fat girl anthem and lose weight and try to remake her image to be seen as sexy . But of course it won't work because her legion of hamfans will shun her . Also because she has a troll face .	EXP

195	holocaust	"Okay , so everything I am reading is just resulting in cognitive dissonance . There are valid sources from each side .. But , I have one statement , and if y'all can refute it , then I will be more inclined to believe in a Revisionist stance : No Nazi was ever a Holocaust denier Many Germans said things - "" it wasn't me I didn't know what I was doing This stuff happens in war ! "" but none ever denied what happened . Would there not be a HUGE controversy today if the Nazis were effectively framed ? They had nothing to lose upon being captured by the Allies , why would they admit to these crimes if they weren't true ? It was death no matter what they said , they knew that . The statement above is a fact , as much as the sky is blue . There are records upon records of this - videos , articles , documentaries , newspapers , pictures , testimonials . Why do even the Nazis themselves disagree with Holocaust denial ? For instance , Rudolf Höss said : I commanded Auschwitz until <NUMBER> December <NUMBER> , and estimate that at least <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning , and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease , making a total dead of about <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> . This figure represents about <NUMBER> % or <NUMBER> % of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners , the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries . ( Höss ' affidavit for his Nuremberg trial ) Why would Höss , of all people , admit to these untruths ? Unless , of course , they're not untruths . They're truths ? How did he manage to come up with such an elaborate lie completely on the fly , that matches the supposed lies told by other captured Nazis ? Why not just tell the truth ? Another point that I would like to make is that yes , scholars devoted their lives to Revisionism regarding the Holocaust . But does that make the concept any more valid ? There are scholars who have devoted their lives to denying the Theory of Evolution . Is it any less valid because of this ?"	EXP

198	fatpeoplehate	"I love a lot of colour in my food ( fruit and vegetables are like a personal rainbow on a plate ) Oh god the mortifying incident Warning : WALL OF TEXT Well we had all planned to go to a local Indian restaurant for one of the guys birthday dinner . I hadn't told my now ex friend ( the ham ) and no one had even suggested to send an invite her way so I guess that was a good red flag for what was to eventually come ( my new friends asking me not to bring her along to any gatherings anymore ) Unfortunately someone had posted something on Facebook and low and behold when we arrive the ham was waiting inside for us . After the initial awkward "" uh hi ? "" that everyone shared with her no one wanted to outright say "" you weren't invited "" so we all just sat down at the reserved table . Lucky for the ham we had a party of <NUMBER> and we took up their largest table that sat <NUMBER> so she could get a seat . She sat right next to the birthday boy ( classic fat fuck manoeuvre drawing all the attention to herself ) we started going through the menus and the Indian waiter suggested we order in pairs and then share meals around ( different curries that come in the cutest brass bowls ) As I said there was <NUMBER> of us to begin ... we could perfectly pair up . But hammy made <NUMBER> and everyone was avoiding eye contact with her . She loudly declared that she wouldn't eat ANY of the food on the menu . The super sweet waiter was trying everything to satisfy her but nope hammy would only eat deep fry stuff ( they even offered those little triangular curry puff things but she was adamant that they would be too spicy ) after throwing a tantrum , which included mimicking the waiters Indian accent to his face , she settled on nibbling a poppadom and a raspberry vodka . The rest of the dinner resulted in having to awkwardly pass curry bowls back and forth along the table and whenever someone wanted to share anything with the birthday boy , hammy would rudely interrupt as well as snarling at the food and constantly making offensive racial slurs about the staff and other patrons . Eventually someone did tell her she was being disrespectful and should not be making such comments and she started to fucking cry She went out for a smoke and collectively the group tried to plan a getaway . Eventually we planned to finish our meals and then leave , making sure no one mentioned ( or posted on Facebook ! ) that we were going to another place for a drink . I apologised to everyone , including the staff . As we were leaving she was out the front scoffing down kfc . There wasn't a kfc anywhere near us ... she had it in her car .

WAY better in my opinion than either Dead Rising . The melee combat is incredibly visceral and while on one hand zombies are easy to kill , on the other hand every one of them is a potential threat . I also really like how the game plays out quest-wise ( admittedly I'm only a few hours in , and only just reached the next major game area ) , because it's not all "" Here take this automatic weapon we found lying around , and kill <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> zombies "" . It's got more of a genuine outbreak survival feel . Go find food . Find water . Find a bigger safe house , because we have <NUMBER> survivors in a tiny hotel room and tensions are running high . Shit like that . The game isn't perfect . Guns so far have been rare , but they kind of handle like shit . Melee weapons are incredibly flimsy , even things that should last forever like lead pipes and crowbars . However , they're lying around EVERYWHERE , so even if your weapon breaks you can just pick one up lying at your feet . Also , while I like the idea of leveling and gaining new skills from experience , I find it odd that the zombies level with you . How ? How are zombies gaining in experience ? They're dead .

You weren't flagrantly disrespectful , which is a breath of fresh air by internet ( maybe even meatspace ) standards , but you were disrespectful at points . And I believe her writing wasn't "" semi-literate "" in the negative sense that I think you meant . You gave too little credit to her analytical skills . I believe your posts and her post were equally logical . I appreciate your caring about a vision of equality and about the , er , problematic nature of much SJWism ( depending on whether you include positive visionaries like MLK in there or just the weird internet type ) , but don't be so quick to throw out the baby with the bathwater the baby is in danger of drowning in as far as social-justice ( which I assume is supposed to mean egalitarian ) adovocacy / efforts go , despite how often they unwittingly play into the interests of the parts of the system that they ostensibly oppose . Be respectful to people insofar as they're making a good-faith effort to be reasonable and respectful ; just because the internet seems detached from the "" real world "" doesn't mean you should be less respectful than you would be in meatspace--though you should mostly have the right to ( except e . g . incitement to imminent , highly violent action ) , and I also find it hard to be respectful on the interweb sometimes . Respect is especially helpful if you're actually planning to do anything major about these issues , which I don't blame you if you aren't and I don't think I am either . With the most condescending , tone-policing part of my reply out of the way : In your OP , I think your second definition is closer to what is meant by "" objectification . "" I see objectification as seeing or treating someone as a resource ( which is not necessarily bad ) or as not fully human ( which makes me more uncomfortable ) . As you alluded to , even the most callous person won't be able to ignore ( and may not be interested in ignoring ) certain human qualities of someone they're objectifying , even in extreme cases where they wouldn't describe their object as human . I don't think shooting porn photos of women for mainstream porn outlets compares , say , to the Holocaust , to slavery , or to parents treating their kids like mere property , though shooting porn photos could still be objectifying to some unhealthy extent , depending on the context of that particular shoot . ( There are definitely some porn photos that give more "" wholesome "" portrayals , for lack of a better term , and are shot in more supportive environments than others . And what about shooting porn photos of men ? And what do non-exclusively-heterosexual folks have to say about porn photos ?

1046	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got !

1086	fatpeoplehate	A favourite of mine is Alfredo , quick and easy . This is roughly for one person . Put a portion or two of fettucine or penne rigate in boiling water . Fry up a clove of freshly-pressed garlic in butter , add a handful or two of bite-size diced meat of your choice : chicken , ham , shrimp or salmon . If you want to get fancy , add a shot of brandy or better , cognac ( just a shot though ! ) . Then once the meat is just cooked , optionally add freshly chopped brown champignons ( ? button mushrooms ) and grate in a fresh tomato . You can puree the tomato as well . Simmer the sauce a bit until the tomato is like a paste . Add 250ml of heavy cream and a handful of shredded Gouda cheese , and a bit of parmesean . Make sure the cheese melts to bind the sauce but keep it simmering very low . Cream-based sauces burn easily . Add in a pinch of nutmeg and some freshly-ground black pepper . Then dump the strained noodles into the sauce and stir . Serve immediately . You can add parmesean on top if it's not salty enough . What's great about this dish is that you don't need to make or prepare a large amount as it is very filling ( like Tortellini or gnocchi ) . You can serve it with a side of string beans , another green veggie of your choice and salad . ... I buy a batch of fresh mushrooms , chop them in larger slices and freeze them . There is no comparison between fresh and canned mushrooms ( which taste like old rubber ) . If you freeze your mushrooms they still taste like fresh when you fry or bake them .	EXP

Also I can't see how you can work in a lab with a FUPA . You can't rest your stomach on the bench , you need to be able to reach quite fat with your arms ( which a stomach would prevent ) . Plus if you're fat enough you can't even fit between benches , access things stored low or high , can't work under a fume hood ( it only has a small opening for your hands at stomach / hips level ) . And ... the icing on the cake : in case of incident you can't fit into a decontamination shower !

And they recently were able to get the Arizona governor to veto a bill that sought to remove all farm and livestock animals from the states anti-cruelty policies ( meaning there would be a lot more inhumane tactics used against livestock and farming ) , so that these animals could stay legally protected . They just generally want more humane treatment for animals , and despite their crazy past they're actually a fair bit better now and work toward things like more humane laws in animal agriculture , reducing animal testing , fighting against the cruel treatment animals endure in circuses ( they recently got another state to ban the use of bullhooks - which are basically glorified spears - against elephants ) , trying to outlaw puppy mills , and other relatively reasonable things . Sure , they've still got some weird things ( like they're trying to get some grocery food chain to stop using a lion in their ads apparently ) , but I do feel like the old shtick about Peta being crazy is a bit outdated . Also holy fuck I didn't realize I ended up writing an essay . Sorry about that , brevity has never been my thing .	EXP

1592	fatpeoplehate	"As someone who was anorexic , recovered then fell back into habits , I can say that my eating disorder ( restriction now , atypical anorexia nervosa / OSFED ) has nothing to do with trying to really be thin for the value of society or other people . I've been struggling with body issues and transgender thoughts for years now . Once your body loses its body fat , you can look male-ish without much problem ( especially since I have narrow hips as is ) and pass more as a male . I know a lot of FtM transgenders who are the same--anorexic to get the lines and lack of body fat that men have . THAT was / is my problem . I have a hell of a lot of other problems ( I wear a hoodie outside even in the summer because of body issues that I see on myself ) and while I think a good portion of those before pictures ' aren't even that thin ' or are ' perfect ' to ME , it has nothing to do with the media at all . I don't watch television / read pop magazines / etc and I haven't since I was like <NUMBER> ? Know the signs of anorexia nervosa and catch that shit before it spirals downwards . I know when I was a kid , I'd often forget to eat when busy , and when I was stressed , I'd barely ever eat . The signs were there before I ever spiralled downwards . I'm not mad at my parents for not noticing ( I haven't ate breakfast since I was like ... <NUMBER> ? So that was normal . And dinner ... I don't even really remember much about dinners now that I'm older ) but the signs of me being potentially able to have an ED were there for ages . Also , there is a correlation to OCD and Asperger's ( I have Asperger's , which is probably why I focus on a calorie bracket rather than stacking shit in categories like the OCD ones ) and ED , as well as genetics . If no one in your family has had an ED , she's prolly in the clear . And for the love of god , don't overly shame her if she gains - a bit - of weight . Most girls I know with EDs are usually triggered in it by their family members always berating their weight and other things about them . There is a way to show concern about weight without saying "" you're so fat now , don't you ever run anymore ? Why would you let yourself get that fat ? ! "" I know this probably sounds scrambled but ... yeah , sorry . Just don't make it about her image , but about health . Part of what keeps me wearing my hoodie even when it's blazing hot can-see-steam-coming-off-the-roads-out-there summer days , is because my mom ( or other people ) will always sound shocked that I'm walking out without my hoodie . And I'm far enough gone now ( <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> BMI , I can't use the scale without ninja-ing in there , it's been a week since I weighed so I'm guessing I'm <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> now ) that even someone saying ' you're too thin / getting too thin ' has me not believing them because the USA is so fucking fat , we have no idea what is ' too thin ' . Keep appearance comments low if you're REALLY suspecting her of an eating disorder . Even ' you look healthy today ' becomes ' you look fat ' to an anorectic ( not me , but no one says that to me ) . Basically , eating disorders usually come with other shit , and a normal person would never get one . If you're genuinely worried , then the chances your daughter will be a bitter fat-hating anorectic / atypical anorectic like me instead of a fantastic shitlord are pretty slim . Don't worry about it , but do know the signs ( you can find the signs anywhere online , but note that some of us DO NOT show all of these things . I don't show most of the signs of the disorder AT ALL , other than hiding my appearance , and as long as something is in my caloric-intake range for the day , I will eat that shit , which is really fucking atypical ) and stay on your toes , but not too much . ( For a little run-down , I have Asperger's , depression , general and social anxiety disorders , panic disorder and there is a very high chance I have body dysmorphia disorder [ I fit all the criteria , with no official diagnosis ] . I genuinely think the atypical anorexia / OSFED comes from the shitty roulette of problems I have . Someone of mental soundness wouldn't be so fucked up and I am almost <NUMBER> % sure you have to have A BIT of BDD to let yourself get as thin as some of those people up there . )"	EXP

If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body .

1649	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

1877	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

2151	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	"You do realize that animals eat plants , right ? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten ? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death .

I could make an argument that you are abusing your children because you don't force them to read the Torah , but I wouldn't be right . Make their insurance prices higher , make them pay more for a plane seat , make them ineligible for handicapped status , I might agree with those but taking someone's children away because you disagree with their style of parenting makes you out to be a mini Hitler ( if that's what you want , cool but be prepared to die in obscurity because everyone thought your idea was trash ) . On a side note if saying "" equality for all "" elicits you to say "" but not them "" then maybe reevaluate why it is you hate some group of people so much that you wish to deny them rights . Equality in modern speech typically is worded in terms of gender , gender identification , creed , and race , which I hope most people would strive for as well , as long as it doesn't hurt , hinder , or otherwise diminish other peoples rights , which is where the exceptions for obese people come in . The fat acceptance ( and rad feminism ) movement in my opinion are movements designed to co-opt , deny or gain an unequal amount of rights from another group , which is why they sound so fucking crazy . I have no problem with equal rights for all but that's not what fat acceptance and sjw's are out to get . They want more rights than anyone else and if not that they want their ignorance to be publicly accepted so they don't have to deal with the cognitive dissonance behind the acknowledgement that they are living wrong or unhealthily . They're selfish basically . I would hope that nothing about a person would take away from their ability to be treated as an equal , even being fat .

If somebody that happens to have a sexual orientation vaguely related to somebody that did something bad to you makes you feel sexually objectified or whatever the SJW term is these days against pedophilia SJW Yeah you can't just say something is being an SJW just to devalue it . I am against this proposed normalization of sexualizing and lusting after children . SJW - - really now ? I'm afraid I can't relate to your SJW mindset that other people's thoughts within their own heads are act Youre using that word again . And yes , you are potential danger to society . The thoughts in your head are wrong and you don't feel wrong .. that should be a warning sign . I don't want a round of applause . I wouldn't mind not being constantly accused of somehow being involved in crimes that I did not even know existed until they are used as an excuse call the fact of my existence some sort of insult against random people . Again , you are not in any special status or minority . African Americans are consistently accused of crimes that they did not commit , and you , just as every other pedo , wants to be under that same status . The difference is that the falsely accused African American has not committed a crime , is not a potential danger to society , and has no intention of ever commiting a crime . He / she has not lusted or fantasized about committing the crime . You have intentions of committing this crime . Here's an idea .

Oh so witty , ya got me Wow I should just retreat into the dark hole I came from while the light shines brightly on your smug face I click on every single link on FPH . Have you seen me around ? I comment on almost every thread . The difference is that I am not saying things that could trigger a response in someone who was abused . I talk about the fatties and that's it . Your comment was smug and was made in this ridiculous vain of "" let me out myself so I can talk about being a pedo and get off on it "" . There was no reason to even comment that .

These hams are brave enough to show their skin , but not courageous enough to limit their caloric intake . There is no moderation for them , just gluttony . They feel entitled to attractive men , despite having more adipose tissue than the majority of humans who ever lived . The adipose is a marker of their ignorance , gluttony , and sloth . It not only acts as a parasite , slowly eroding at the host with symptoms like cardiac issues and insulin resistance - but it acts as a determent of replication . Males should be unattracted to these diseased mammals for the purpose of sustaining adequate genetics for a stronger biological future . There is never a time where one should strive for fat acceptance . It is precisely the same as vouching for alcoholism acceptance or self-harm acceptance .

3234	fatpeoplehate	Right now I'm researching facts proving that obesity is unhealthy . Medical journals , actual research papers done on it so obeasts can't use the excuse of HAES . Proving HAES false is a step in the right direction . We all know its bullshit that tumblrinas throw around , but as long as they believe it , it's a problem . The research could lead into why fast food is more likely to cause weight gain , decreased life span , increased risk of many diseases , etc etc . There's a ton of info out there covering everything we know fatties use as excuses . After all this would be condensed into a business card or something similar , handing it out and telling people to lose weight and take control of their fucking lives would at least help in the shaming process . The fact that we would go to enough lenhs to prove that being a fatass is unacceptable and a detriment to society ( and my tax dollars ) , it would benefit us shitlords in the long run . Less hams at the gym , less at the grocery store or on the bus or at the movies or everywhere . Some of them still won't get it or won't get the motivation . That's when my shaming is at it's best . I'll still going to call people fat and call them out on their lies . An ultimate resource that is portable like a card , factual and up to date would make it so they would realize their own fucking lies and change their lifestyle . Maybe I'm being too kind suggesting this , but fuck it I can shame them all I want , but I want the facts to prove it so we don't have bitches like Tess Munster out there confusing people and making the world a bigger shithole than it already is .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

3415	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system .

Never have I noticed this type of behavior from any other group . It's gotten to the point where I just won't hold his hand in public if we're walking through certain areas . It sucks , but I try not to sweat it . Back in high school , a black girl started dating a white guy which was absolutely unheard of , even though I didn't live in a racist area and black guys dated black girls all the time . I remember sitting at lunch with my friends ( a mix of races but predominately black guys and girls ) and one of the guys was ranting about how it "" wasn't right "" and how this girl clearly hated black guys . This guy's best friend ( who was black ) had dated a white girl earlier in the school year and when I asked why he didn't seem to have a problem with it , his answer surprised me . He said that it was different , that when a black guy "" got with "" a white girl , he was pissing off "" The White Man "" . When a black girl got with a white guy , on the other hand , it was because she was being stolen from black men and she was just letting it happen . So it was okay for his best friend , because he was sticking it to "" The White Man "" but this girl was defiling herself and disgracing her race all because she liked a white guy . Most of the black guys at the table agreed with what he said . I was livid . Over the years , I've encountered similar conversations with both black men and women with similar reasoning . I've even heard extended family talk poorly about a cousin who married a white guy . No one said anything , though , about my uncle who has been married to a white woman for years . Reasons for why black women dating out ( which never includes hispanic people for some reason , just white and Asian guys ) is terrible that I've heard from family / family friends include : "" All white people are racist . "" , "" He won't respect you . "" , "" He's using you to say he got with a black girl . "" and so on . I even had a family friend quote Genesis <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> to me when she found out I was dating a white guy , saying that it was against the bible . I'm not even religious . There also seems to be a cultural narrative that pervades the black community that black men should be lauded for simply being because there is such a lack of men in the community ( in part due to high rates of incarceration ) . A black woman who complains about her man is told "" He's a good man He's never been to jail "" or "" At least he doesn't beat you ! "" Black men have it hard , we're told since we're young , so we girls have to watch out for them . In black families , boys are often treated like princes . Women are expected to take care of men--just in my extended family alone , I can think of at least ten examples of women who work full-time jobs and take care of their children and their husband / boyfriend who either doesn't work or barely does and this is seen as completely acceptable ( and I'm talking women with advanced degrees taking care of men who are part-time security guards--nothing wrong with that if that's what makes you happy , I'm just pointing out how normalized wage disparity can be in black relationships as opposed to the average ) . An example of this : when I was in high school , there were SOOO many scholarship opportunities for black boys . So many . Far fewer for black girls specifically or even just black students in general . Black boys were offered a myriad of college trips and whatnot ( all sponsored by local organizations [ mostly church groups ] , so they weren't officially through the school ) . Black girls got close to nothing . Not saying I expected or needed them , just pointing out an example of a difference in treatment in a predominately black school . As for why black women may choose not to date white guys in particular , I've heard various reasons , ranging from "" He just won't get me "" to worrying that his family might be racist even if he wasn't . Some just aren't attracted to white guys . I will say that in my own experience , the thing that might have made me more cautious toward dating outside of my race ( white guys in particular ) would be my early college experiences when it seemed like every white guy who approached me seemed to be fetishizing my race and not really trying to get to know me as a person . I try not attribute people's actions to their race or gender and treat everyone as individuals so this never translated to me writing off white guys but I could see how it could for someone else . Giving a guy you sorta like your number and then having him text about how he's "" never been with a black girl "" sucks . Making out with a guy and then having him whisper in your ear that he's "" never been with a black girl "" sucks . Getting flirty with a friend and having him mention how he's "" never been with a black girl "" in a wanna-be seductive tone sucks . It's like , do you wanna get with me or my skin ? So I'll say that of the black women I know who refuse to date outside of their race , it's a combo of cultural pressure not to do it , an obligation ingrained in black women that black men "" need "" us , and being pursued by non-black guys who make it known that their attraction stops at your race and that they fail to see you as an individual . Obviously , that's not everything , but it's what I've experienced and seen through my life . Hope that helped ?"	EXP

If times are hard , I ’ ll resort to boxed wine ; if things are really tough — heartbreak levels of tough — you ’ ll find me in bed drinking the boxed wine straight from the bag , quietly sobbing , merlot smudged on my cheeks . In these rock-bottom situations , shitting the bed is acceptable , understandable . But even for me , empty fifth bottles getting tangled up in pyjamas is a step too far . Drinking is not about fixing broken hearts : It'a about pure , sloppy drunken joy . A fifth of liquor for breakfast might signify an alcohol problem to you , but to me every pull is like going home to clean clothes and fresh tap water after a week spent waist deep in a mud at a festival , having survived purely on cider and MDMA — i . e . , heaven . I blame sitting on my dad ’ s car bonnet at age eight , scrapping with my sisters over who got the last beer from Dad's <NUMBER> pack , brandishing empty bottles at each other like Game of Thrones extras who got left out of some hard-earned flaying . Then came the pheromone-heady days of sitting in cars with boys , trying to somehow make sucking on a sloppy drunken makeout seductive because Kelis told us it was totally the right thing to do . That was followed by a three-year cycle of making it to lectures on two hours of sleep , with the knowledge that the only thing making getting to class possible is lots of coffee and that most sexy of coffee creamers : Whipped cream flavored Vodka . Oh yes , the defining taste of many a regret-filled <NUMBER> AM kiss . That ’ s not forgetting the time I incurred the wrath of my teachers on a school trip to Paris . They wanted to go eat at a nice upscale winery , while I considered it necessary to forgo a delicious meal with my classmate for a beautiful liquor store calling to me from round the corner of the Sacré-Coeur . What , after all , is more French than French Forty Oz Malt liquors ? <NUMBER> of them . Apparently I was on my own . A weekend in Barcelona in <NUMBER> - degree heat was also defined by pilgrimages to the local liquor , sweaty and weak with the shakes , sipping watery beers as slowly as possible in order to keep withdrawals at bay .. While at Abu Dhabi ’ s airport — while waiting for a connecting flight after drinking nothing but water for breakfast , lunch , and dinner every day for two weeks in India — I even crawled up an escalator , mouth-crying happy tears of saliva , as a bar came breathtakingly into view . A peaceful , stomach-settling calm washed over me with each glass of whiskey , each tequila shot , as I slid wonderfully into a drunken stupor . To be fair , I never really stood a chance at developing any kind of willpower when it came to Alcohol . My mother marched me to a bar when I hit <NUMBER> , having not yet tried a beer topped with a thick foamy head , poured straight from the tap leading to who knows where being the counter . It was a real moment , that — and when we did a runner from the liquor store together . I have a lot to thank her for . Not least is the knowledge that the best way to go for your death row , last-night-on Earth drink isn ’ t fancy , obvious beverages like the finest french wine , Aged single malt scotch older than you are , or a cold microbrew hand crafted for flavor to entertain the palate of the most refined beer drinkers . It ’ s two <NUMBER> oz Steel Reserves : High Gravity , no glass , no argument . Don ’ t judge . Except , people do , don ’ t they ? Nothing riles up the drink counting , sober at work , non drunk driving , cheap beer free , don't get sloppy drunk on Tuesdays , <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> sobermasochist party pooper contingent like someone happily pulling off a brown bagged bottle of booze to re-emerge from the bushes with vomit all over their pants , this mornings Irish Coffee plastered to chins , half empty tall boys poking out of pockets for later ( they are excellent warm — you should try it ) . These righteous social drinkers murmur scathingly , “ That ’ s no way to live , ” like they ’ re better than this , and flaunt their clean clothes and ability to hold a job to spit condescendingly : “ I haven ’ t gotten drunk in years ” Then they either shamefully steal a sip of my drink , robbing me of cheap booze buzz goodness in the process ( I don ’ t share ) while they ruefully plot their guilt-ridden week of not drinking the next day related atonement , or talk up their hangovers , run to call a cab ( “ No , keeping to the back roads isn't safe ” ) , and then dash home to a big glass of water , not even with ice . The snobbery makes you want to ram cheap beer and vodka down their temple-like throats . I like water and sobriety as much as the straight edge kid , but sometimes Ice water and a glass of wine just don't cut it . Sometimes you want — no , need — a couple 4Lokos , however “ disgusting ” it may be to some . Sure , I don ’ t appreciate the fact that every single sip is another slap in the face to my liver , however it makes my problems seem smaller . It is a shame , to be fair . I admit there are weekends when I seriously worry that if you took a blood sample , there would be more blood than alcohol . But I can ’ t stop . I don ’ t want to . And you can ’ t make me . So shut up and have another sip	EXP

3910	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

4075	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

Whether it takes place at noon or in the evening is mostly a cultural thing . For instance , many people who grew up in the American South and / or on farms traditionally ate larger meals at noontime to give them the strenh to keep working through the afternoon . Supper is more specifically a lighter evening meal . Rooted in the word "" to sup "" , it comes , again , from farming traditions — many farming families would have a pot of soup cooking throughout the day , and would eat it in the evening — specifically , they would "" sup "" the soup . Lunch is almost the midday equivalent of supper — it's also a lighter and less formal meal than Dinner , but is used specifically when referring to a midday meal . So whether you use lunch / dinner or dinner / supper is heavily determined by when your culture traditionally has its largest meal . but these are terms that were used in the past . in modern times breakfast is what they eat in the morning , lunch is what they call a midday meal , and dinner is what they eat before bed . some people still use the term "" supper "" , but at this day in age it usually means ' dinner ' . and .. this , paired with the fact that <NUMBER> % of america is now overweight and thus they eat way more often than three times a day is why you were confused ( not to mention the constant snacking . where i live a snack is an apple or an orange ... not so much in america . ) We have quality with good quantity . They have very poor quality in extreme quantities . that seems to be the american way when it comes to food , yup . and countries which look up to america seem to be following this path as well some parts of europe are very americanized and i noticed this to be the case . And sorry if I offended you , friend , please don't be a sad shitlord no worries i wasn't offended , i've just been lurking this sub for a while now , and i am aware some people from eating disorder subs come here . these people are battling a real mental issue when it comes to eating and food , so i don't want them to be nudged back down the wrong path by thinking of the food as the enemy . :( i care about our fellow shitlords . <NUMBER> again , sorry if i came off as rude spread the fat hate indeed . :D"	EXP

If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

4779	explainlikeimfive	, has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big . Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

5206	fatpeoplehate	Of course the comments have obese people making excuses and saying the BMI is inaccurate . I wish every article that mentioned BMI included the fact that it UNDERESTIMATES obesity by body fat percentage , especially in women . I think the results of this study are really interesting . It makes sense that the metabolic state your body goes through when adding to your fat stores can have a negative impact on your blood health markers and other health indicators even if you are still at a technically healthy weight . Humans were never meant to stay in bulk mode on a regular basis . We are supposed to use our fat stores in times of famine , not constantly add to them . There are so many health benefits to letting your body use energy from stored fat . Fasting or losing weight activates body processes that put your body in repair mode and get rid of damaged cells . If you are steadily gaining a pound or more every month , that puts a lot of stress on all your organs , and your digestive system never gets a break . On top of that , there's the negative hormonal impact of excess fat beyond what you need to get through a famine or injury . I do think that people who have body fat levels a bit above essential body fat can start experiencing ill health , even if they are in the healthy BMI range . I know everybody is going to say that this study is bullshit , though .	EXP

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

5753	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT
