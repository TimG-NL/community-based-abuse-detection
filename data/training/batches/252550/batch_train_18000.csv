2	Seattle	My husband and I ride . I just started last month . He's been riding for years . He just got back from a great ride . Yes , it's wet . If you're not comfortable in that , don't ride . If you are , then you're golden . Yes there are hills . There are routes so that you can avoid the worst of the hills for either lights or rain . If all else fails , there's a great bus system in place . I'm still pretty much a fair weather rider , but I've been out a bunch of times since I got my endorsement last month . Even several times this week . I got rained on once , but I have waterproof gear , so I didn't care , other than being my first time in the rain . The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists . At least I haven't noticed a problem yet . But even when driving I like Seattle drivers . However , we moved from NC three years ago where you need to develop a sixth sense against the idiocy of driving there . So anywhere seems tame and normal after that for <NUMBER> years . People use turn signals here to indicate a turn . Other drivers see that and respect it . There are far fewer tailgaters here . The pace is generally much much slower , about the speed limit rather than <NUMBER> mph above it . The roads are noisier , though . There are quite a few Seattleites over on / r / motorcycles . So you can pose your question there and get a much more rider centric view on it . I haven't ridden anywhere else , but I like riding here . So much to see and do , fun roads and straight roads , highways and country roads . My husband likes to drive up to the mountains , turn around and come home .	NOT

5	milliondollarextreme	Too much energy expended here . Your post seems to be an amalgamation of the lenhier text bits of Sam's videos and social critiques . There is nothing wrong with being influenced by Sam , but this is a clear derivative and it isn't very funny . Compare this , to say ... Sam's critique of the biracial girl who went on a cross country road trip to pester the more or less defunct KKK at their bake sale . The absurdity of that premise and her general philosophy was much better material . I think it's clear you tried something similar here , but the difference is that he was far more concise and had jokes between the commentary . You go from this girl getting an audience from inconsequential vine clips to existentialism where it's not really appropriate . I am personally indifferent to this girl's success on vine as the clips are fairly innocuous . She is probably going to go to a better school than me , get way more dick than I ever could , and I truly don't give a shit .	EXP

11	uncensorednews	The second you say the word confiscation I have to smile at you . Over <NUMBER> million guns are in circulation in the US . Attempts at confiscation would fail on so many levels . Practically no soldiers and officers would be down for confiscating civilian arms on a national level , since they all swore an oath to uphold the constitution . But lets assume for sake of argument that they would obey . How do you think that would turn out ? Think about how disorganized and simple a lot of the guerilla fighters in the middle east are . Now think about how many well trained , far superiorly armed Americans there are out there . Many ex military , tons of sports shooters who have shooting skills that no active duty police officer possesses . Almost all the cops barely shoot more than the yearly qualification , and now you want them to go out in the streets to break their oath and confiscate civilian arms , risking their lives while the odds are against them . I don't see it .	IMP

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear .

The fight for "" tolerance "" became the fight for "" acceptance "" and any opposition is branded as "" hatred "" and "" bigotry . "" Now homosexual partnerships are treated legally the same as real marriage . You think that pedophiles can't or won't play the same long con , or aren't already starting ? It won't be an outright demand to screw your children . It'll be a softening of defenses with stories about "" virtuous pedophiles "" , people unjustly arrested for fake CP , or teenagers arrested for its production , and they'll make some valid points . From there , it's just another small step down to "" kids are already having sex , so let's lower the age of consent a few years "" and "" if they can have sex , why can't they video it ? "" , and soon , mere possession of consensual CP becomes legal . Maybe some sympathizers in the media start including friendly , lovable pedo characters in prime time sitcoms ... and so it goes . Give it a few more decades before "" pedophobia "" works its way into the common vernacular ."	EXP

606	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

764	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks . Male Hollywood already knows that chick flicks are soul-sucking monstrosities that should be taken out back and shot . Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

1102	uncensorednews	Islam is a whole system that lead to it becoming the only religion look at ME . If you want it explained then here it is a good place to start : <URL> Sorry , but a satirist / comidean on youtube is no real source of information . Similar as i do not quote John Oliver , simply because everything they use tends to be cut out of context for time and laughter , so you cannot know when it is in context and when not . They aren't an organization they are people that are living there . Just because they aren't part of any organization it doesn't mean that they aren't Islamist . Never said that . Talking about these Organisations because I wanted to differentiate them from normal muslims . Also , Islamist is basically meaning being part or affiliated to those organisations . everyone else is no worse than christian orthodox : They are focused on religion , but they won't blow you up because of it . Small ? You mean vast majority are Islamist . I don't care if they are radical or not , they views are incompatible with secular free society . Islamist is synonymous with radical . And the vast majority are muslim , not islamist . No it isn't since that would be a silly stereotype not something that is well researched , and factual . and calling Syrians / Irakis / Afgahns etc , all those refugees nationalities , ( mostly ) Islamic is not ? Calling them mostly muslim is already close to being a stereotype , given there are several other confessions there too . but already going in to calling them Islamist , and extending that to the refugees , is outright unjustified . Do those kids get more welfare ? You understand that they have no papers , and they just claim what they age is , right ? Yes , they might not have papers . But no , childs do not get more welfare in germany . They actually get less ( since they are assumed to have less expenses ) , and a lot of them travel alone , so they would actually have an interest to say they were older . I call that bs study . Sorry , i am no native speaker . Do you mean you want a source ? So not very useful to see how it works for muslim population . No , actually as useful as it gets . Like i said , it said that there were almost no variances between different origin countries . It is too general because it isn't only about muslims . As i said , the data was consistent throughout all different groups . I am saying that families that do pre-arranged marriage with females from Pakistan or Somalia can be in minority but steal become a significant % due to how many kids they have . Even if that were to work ( and there is much more factors to it than just this , like 2nd gens likelyhood to not marry another 2nd gen or a pre-arragned partner ... ) , it would take so many generations that we cannot predict how other groups will have changed up until that point .

What they tell the doctors cannot be faked [ unless they want to help dx you ] . Then there are the tests and observations over a period of time by the doctors / staff . Combine these and the interview of the person who claims to have it , then you have several barriers to facetious disorders and conditions . Then on an anecdotal level , why would I go through hell in every year in school except college ? Why and how could I fake clumsiness / sensory sensitivity probs when I was a child [ before the disorder was recognized ] ? I had misunderstandings every hour [ that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature ] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [ and other awkward attempts at being "" good "" ] ? Why would the doctors tell my parents that I was ALmost autistic [ after-all Asperger's is a milder form of autism ] when I was having those problems at elementary schools ? I had ALL of the characteristics a girl with Asperger's at that age would display , not something I could plan or make up like many of the people with facetious disorders do . Kids at kindergarten age do not have this facetious / Munchhausen's dz or at least they do not plan-out a life-long condition , they may pretend they have a boo boo but that's it . [ My mother did not want this and does not show any Munchhausen's-type symptoms or characteristic personality quirks like strong desire for attention ] . Just like the many other types of deniers , I think YOU have a reason to dislike these ideas associated with the mind . Therefore you deny it all and camp with the anti-psychiatry tribe . You are lucky to have the internet to get more confirmations of your belief as well as Scientology [ whose founder had it out for them too ] . Me , I had no idea about Asperger's while I was forced to be dx'd . I thot I had anxiety disorder and / or depression and OCD [ with out the compulsions to wash hands for eg . ] . My mother was devastated that they had treated the way they did when I was a kid ; my father is an engineer with similar characteristics [ and seems nonplussed about it ] .

1890	fatpeoplehate	Let me preface this off by saying that I ’ m about as furry as they get . I don ’ t own a suit , but , I ’ ve done everything else . Gone to conventions , bought art , made art for people , role-played , I frequent / r / furry … everything on the standard checklist . I am very , very involved in the fandom . However , the more involved I get , the more disturbed I get by the sheer level of fatlogic and general fat-ness of the community . Like , this chick is common . Either furries are nerdy twigs with thick glasses and braces , or they ’ re something out of / r / justneckbeardthings ; fat as a whale , wearing a fedora , and cracking distasteful sexual jokes in public . You know , standard fat nerd with no social skills shit . But that ’ s not the worst part about the furry community . Most people look nothing like their furry avatar , or fursona . Generally , all of them are a fatties ’ wet dream . Tall , athletic , muscular , and most of all … not fat . You can guess where this is going . Jesus . Fucking . Christ . The difference is alarming sometimes . Automatically , I assume a furry is fat as anything unless proven otherwise . All of them , besides the occasional nerdy twig , are at least overweight if not obese . While I ’ ve managed to gather a group of shitlords around me who ’ re into fitness and like , actually vaguely looking human , everyone else is so damn fat it ’ s horrifying . Furries in general are fatty-escapist shit taken to an extreme . All obeast fursonas have at least a six-pack , if not eight , if male , and are into the negative dress sizes if female . None of them are fat unless they ’ re into that disgusting fetish . It ’ s the ultimate proof of fat logic . While they can ’ t escape being fat , they realize how ugly their excess adipose makes them , and so create fursonas that ’ re uber-attractive as a form of compensation for that . Ugh … It ’ s hard being a furry sometimes . Literally , have a BMI of under <NUMBER> , girl or guy , and people get really creepy on you . I've been touched , groped , cat-called ( I'm a guy ) ... you name it , I've had it done to me , and I'm a high seven <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . I'm not smokin ' hot .

1917	politics	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

2155	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

2542	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

FBI is full of Trump supporters and is probably not eager to cross that bridge . Yeah that handful lose their appeal when the overwhelming majority are adamantly against you . Some of us don't possess the blanket ignorance to forgive entire countries that marry their children , stone their women , ruthlessly persecute homosexuals and slaughter religious minorities just because a few muslims say it's not a good thing ( while secretly praising jihadists ) Trump does business with the Saudis , he's not going to do anything to them . And now your kind are ready and willing to engage in a war with Russia because your starlet wants to impose an act of war over Syria . Funny how things change . Yeah , no . That is a completely baseless accusation with a blatant disregard for the truth . She has not said she was going to steamroll Russia , and the details are most likely still being negotiated . It's called Trump . The entire reason Trump has made gains is because the GOP and the Republican party have acted as controlled opposition . They have conserved nothing in the past four decades . Trump's appeal reaches to the conservatives who are disgusted with the GOP which is why the GOP hate Trump . So let me get this straight .

2925	uncensorednews	They're not required to be democratic , no , but they are presented that way and people expect them to be that way . When people see things that seem underhanded or corrupt in their elections it makes the people question other elections and their trustworthiness , effectively undermining the democratic component to our national government . The parties don't try to change that image because they know that if they did it would cause public outcry and many would vote against them for that express reason . To behave with integrity while having the primaries be handled by the party elite it would be necessary to announce in advance that the party elite want the common people to just trust them . At that point the party might capsize and cease to exist , but it would be a path with integrity . To try to enjoy the benefit of having the people feel that their votes decide the primary and then manipulate the situation behind the scenes so that the party elite handles things instead is essentially trying to have your cake and eat it , too .

A voter base that can be springboarded off of to push whatever the fashionable liberal cause of the day is , in this instance free healthcare . The left doesn't actually care about gay people anymore than they care about pandering to any other liberal political issue for votes and virtue signaling .

"" Yo what I never understood is why don't teachers actually give more problems where it's impractical to use the other methods ? If you truly understand the limitations and practical applications of the methods you are teaching , this should be easy . For example , suppose you are teaching the application of calculus to finding minima and maxima . If you ask me to find the minimum of the function x ^ <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> x + <NUMBER> , obviously I wouldn't bother to use calculus , I would immediately recognize that it factors as ( x - <NUMBER> ) ^ <NUMBER> . Instead , you should ask me to find the minimum x ^ <NUMBER> + 3x ^ <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> on the interval [ - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> ] or something . Here's another example : Solve the equation sin ( x ) + cos ( x ) = k . Yes one method is to write cos ( x ) in terms of sin ( x ) and do out the algebra and quadratic formula . But suppose the student is clever and realizes that you may rewrite the left side as sqrt ( <NUMBER> ) sin ( x + pi / <NUMBER> ) . Then he just needs to solve sin ( x + pi / <NUMBER> ) = k / sqrt ( <NUMBER> ) which is much easier . Basically I disagree with penalizing students for using correct methods that work .

3041	uncensorednews	"Nope . Let me put this in context for you . There is a real difference between going to "" bad areas "" and having an entire group of people in cities out to get you . Avoiding a dangerous place in New Orleans for instance is an easy task , just don't go too far down Bourbon at night . If all those dangerous people in New Orleans were actively hunting you and working in coordination with hotel staff to drug and micro kidnap you then that's a different story . That is Mexico City . So last year a friend of mine took over the Latin American sales unit of a competitor . We're still friends , it's all good . However I warned him about this kind of shit . So he's at the Marriott with an employee and goes to get into a taxi ( WRONG ! ) while his employee hops into another one to another destination . Well the bartender at the Marriott drugs my buddy and as he gets into the taxi he starts to feel it and partially passes out . Taxi driver brings him to the lowest level of the parking deck where a couple other guys are waiting . Driver shoves a gun into his face and they proceed to rob him blind , then take off . At least he wasn't hurt . Prior to that my technical assistant at the time went down to Colombia and I warned him not to get into taxis or any of that other crap .

Fractional reserve banking increases the size of the money supply ( i . e . amount of money in circulation ) but it doesn't let a bank lend out money it doesn't actually have . When we both deposit 200k in bank <NUMBER> , bank <NUMBER> can make a loan of up to $ 200k . Someone comes along and borrows 200k - this person may deposit 50k of that money into bank <NUMBER> , therefore allowing bank <NUMBER> to make out of a loan of $ 50k . This $ <NUMBER> . 4m number ( or whatever it is ) assumes three things , which aren't necessarily true : All loan proceeds are deposited back into bank accounts - which makes no sense , people take loans to buy things like cars and houses and pay off credit cards . In reality the money filters through the economy and may eventually end up at a bank anywhere in the world Any loan proceeds deposited into a bank account must be deposited with the same bank that made the original loan - which probably won't happen , given there are thousands of banks in the US , let alone the world . i . e . if bank <NUMBER> made a loan of 200k , there's no guarantee the 50k deposit would be with bank <NUMBER> , it's more likely to be elsewhere . No reserve ratio There is definitely some element of this happening ( i . e . loan proceeds becoming bank deposits at other banks ) , but the Federal Reserve puts brakes on lending by dictating reserve requirements for banks ( i . e . what fraction of deposits must be held at the Fed , the "" fractional "" in fractional reserve ) . Thus , the $ <NUMBER> . 4m thing never happens - maybe the money supply is inflated to $ 300k or $ 400k depending on reserve requirements , but this is split amongst many banks and potentially countries . Bank <NUMBER> is not going on a crazy lending spree . In economics this whole concept is called the multiplier effect of money . This lending / deposit / lending cycle has increased the size of the money supply , but it hasn't actually let bank <NUMBER> make $ <NUMBER> . 4m in loans . Yes , a bank can monetize future loan cashflows & package this as a securitized bond , and then use the proceeds of this securitized bond to make more loans - that happens all the time with mortgages - but really now , that's far beyond this topic"	NOT

Either the bible is right , or it's wrong .

Not everyone believes the bible literally . I do . I don't see any other way . To read it and take bits and pieces of it that satisfy you or fit your world view is to destroy the whole thing I think , or turn it into nothing more than a book of philosophy . I cannot do that . Many can , I cannot - it would be illogical . Now , because I came to conclude that our understanding of evolution is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the biblical account of creation , I've dived deeper and have discovered science that better fits my world view . You can see a lot of it at [ Answers in Genesis ] ( <URL> and and [ The Institute for Creation Research ] ( <URL> I recommend you check out those sites .

3262	uncensorednews	"“ Goy ” is a Jewish word used to refer to non-Jews . Let's be very clear about this - "" Goy "" or "" Goyim "" is by no means a simple little term for gentiles .

It denotes that gentiles are brainless cattle whose sole purpose in life is to serve and die for jewish ( "" God's Chosen People "" ) interests . The profane nature of this term is extensively present in the Talmud and would make things in the old testament seem tame , doctrines that state it is okay to steal from , rape and murder goyim freely , claims that a million goyim lives aren't worth a single jewish finger nail and more writings along the same thought pattern . Contrary to what many jews ( and the good goyim they employ ) this is not some bizarre conspiracy theory attributed to fascists / nazis / whatever buzz word they use at the time . All of evidence of what "" goyim "" means can be read in their own sacred books presuming you're reading one that hasn't been doctored to appear more gentile friendly .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

3765	sjwhate	But you're still not seperating the concept of ethnic class from pure statistical demographic .

You might disagree with this , but im firmly of the belief that there is a systemic bias in favour of white people in our culture , and it all stems back to the idea of ' minority ' class and ' majority ' class . To anyone arguing the bias doesn't exist , you only need to look back <NUMBER> years , not even a lifetime , and it was historical fact . White people were literally seen as the superior race . Keep going back and it's subjugation a long way down . Im not saying white people need to be guilty of this , im just highlighting that this sense of white superiority is ingrained in our culture . It doesn't disapear in a couple generations . This is why i feel the need to call out people propagating the idea of an attack against the white majority . It's not about the white , it's about the majority . It's a thinly veiled attempt to call for defense of historical white supremacy . In reality no one's attacking you . People just want equality . There is no other ' class ' that gets to take over . The class is human . It's about bringing the groups together into one , not dragging one down so another can rise .

The truth is that with a real partner , you do not have to earn basic kindness and respect . This is key . You BOTH get those things , right off the bat and for the duration of the relationship . Anyone who cannot manage basic , kindergarten-level kindness is not being a real partner to you , and you leave . I had trouble with the same thing you did : if he treated me so well right at the beginning , why couldn't we just go back to that ? Honestly , I never figured out why he thought it was okay to bait me with kindness and romance and then treat me poorly . But with time , I realized that his behavior would never make sense to me , because I want the people I date to feel good . Basically , I figured out that I'll never understand why he was a huge asshole because I'm not a huge asshole . Don't be scared .

4427	rpg	Their construction is actually pretty awesome . As I understand it , it's not physically possible to create those polyhedrons except by 3D printer . The ones I have are the Antique Bronze Matte . They've got some serious weight to them ( made of metal ) and they are every bit as pointy as they look . I haven't drawn blood yet , but that d4 could wreck a bare foot , lol . I have all my campaign notes on Google Docs that way I can write them out on my desktop and pull them up on my laptop while running the game . I'm in the market for a tablet to further improve this process while minimizing the table space requirement , but Google just completely threw me off by mentioning the possibility of a Nexus-like tablet . Anyway ... We meet every Sunday at one of the guys ' house around <NUMBER> , start playing around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , end around <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> . We alternate Sundays with me running a Divine 4e campaign and one of the other guys running a Pathfinder game . My game has the party as reincarnated high priests of Pelor getting sent out as a crack team of undead stompers . They're going up against one Vecna's top lieutenants , Osterneth , the Bronze Lich . I tossed out most of her back story and came up with my own , though keeping her personality traits . The world itself is one that I've run another campaign in about a year ago , except the current campaign is <NUMBER> years in the future after she's taken over and rules most of the world with undead . Suffice to say the party from the first campaign failed to stop her , lol . Unfortunately , two of the <NUMBER> players from that group ( not my Sunday group ) moved away and the game had to end . I was a little relieved because running <NUMBER> games simultaneously while playing in a 3rd is a wee bit taxing . I only got the thorn dice about a month ago and now I make sure to use them to maximum dramatic effect . Sometimes it's a treasure role , sometimes it's letting the dice decide how a chaotic NPC will respond , sometimes it's an environmental hazard or random encounter .

4582	uncensorednews	I've met her before , it was a few years ago but we attended the same undergraduate college . She's pretty nice irl , or was a few years ago . The comments on her weight are unwarranted and don't make anyone look correct , same goes for any misogyny or racism directed towards her . But I feel like this is a gross misunderstanding of what reparations are . Yes , black Americans do deserve monetary help to uplift them so they can receive the same opportunities as white people , this can also be said for other racial minorities . But this doesn't come in the form of individuals donating to someone's pay pals . It comes in the form of people who are literally rich from their families owning slaves , people who can trace their ancestry to that , ( not a huge population in America ) , donating to black communities , like helping out inner city schools get better funding , donating to food pantries in the area . White people did put black people in America in the position they're in now , due to slavery , segregation , the homestead act , the war on drugs , etc so yes white people should be helping to get black people out of that position . But that comes from rebuilding communities better , whether it's supporting black owned businesses or helping black teenagers go to college and leave without huge debt hanging over their head ( which should really apply to everyone ) . Donating to someone's PayPal doesn't actually do anything to dismantle institutionalized racism or help marginalized communities , it's just paying lip service to them . Actually helping black people rise out of poverty , and extinguishing white supremacy is what will dismantle institutionalized racism . It's really sad when I see things like this because a few months back I listened to Opal Tometti speak , she's the one who coined the hashtag blacklivesmatter after George Zimmerman was acquitted . She spoke of what people can do , why this is an important movement , and she made sense when she did it . She spoke of goals and solutions and the actions needed to get there . She's a really intelligent woman , and it wasn't that she was playing respectability politics that made people listen , she was absolutely not forgiving in speaking about white supremacy , she was not interested in coddling white people , but she explained what had been happening and why it's important and how it can be fixed . I've never heard anyone speak so well honestly . Basically , it's a really complicated issue but people are putting their emotions in front of rational discussions and it's causing a lot of arguments and unnecessary insults . You don't need to comment on her weight to argue her points , and believe me , she does not give a shit if you call her fat .	EXP

That , however , wasn't even the point of that link . You were actively confusing glyphosate for an organophosphate insecticide . Also your link mentions UDA , hmmm ... I think you meant USDA , but you're going on a tangent now . Same for posting a link to the Organic Consumers Association ( slightly hypocritical much for someone throwing around the shill card so much ? ) . I'm not sure how that seemed like a good tactic to dismiss your previous post where you demonstrated you have next to no working competency on the topic . Obviously the science is not clear on glyphosate because farmers are reporting horrible side effects to their animals which use glyphosate tainted feed , but they are too scared to go on camera and say anything for fear of Monopoly based law suits and have their farms taken . Citation still needed on the first part . Sounds like you're not familiar with the legal system if you think farmers would be getting sued if there was a problem . It sounds like an extension of . You're getting paid to shill for a company , so that doesn't make you a scientist , it makes you a paid propagandist with zero conscience who tracks down glyphosate keywords so you can shill for others instead of speaking your own mind These responses are always a little bit interesting considering there's no real world basis for the claim ( and some constantly try to engage in poisoning the well tactics to avoid facts they don't like ) . As explained before , independent scientists will call out the facts and the bullshit regardless of where they fall . Sometimes that means calling a company's advertising , etc . out ( which we do a lot of ) . Sometimes that also means calling out conspiracy theorist propgandists such as yourself that choose to ignore the science the same way those companies do . You're acting no better than what you perceive as a threat right now , which is why you're getting lumped into the same category as the very thing you're treating as a boogeyman right now . When agricultural companies are spewing figurative bullshit , we'll still be there telling the public it does not in fact smell like roses , but that also means you get the same treatment when you do the same .

4681	Terraria	"I can't help going in depth too much : Generally at that point you'll be ready for the Corruption . Hopefully you have gotten a grappling hook by this point , as the chasms in the corruption will just be plain annoying without one . The key ingredient is the hook , which is a frustratingly rare drop ( like <NUMBER> % ) from Skeletons and Piranhas . The boss in the Corruption is called Eater of Worlds and is summoned by destroying <NUMBER> Shadow Orbs , which are floating balls that spawn at the bottom of the Corruption ( they're super obvious when you see them ) . They can be broken with a hammer . The only snag is that they tend to be in their own mini caves and the Corruption is made of Ebonstone blocks , which you can only mine with a Nightmare pickaxe or better , which you can only craft once you've killed the Eater of Worlds ! ( He drops shadow scales , which are necessary to make almost all Demonite equipment ) . Luckily , Bombs and Dynamite still blow up Ebonstone , and you've probably found a bunch of those from pots and chests already . Alternatively you can craft a summoning item for him like the Suspicious Eye , but you'll probably want to get items from the Shadow Orbs anyway . When you break Shadow Orbs an item will fall out - either a Musket , a Ball O ' Hurt , a Vilethorn , a Starpower Band , or an Orb of Light . Vilethorn is a spell which I find to make this boss laughably easy . However , you'll need mana to use it . For that you'll need to craft <NUMBER> Fallen Stars into a Mana Crystal , which gives you <NUMBER> max mana just like the Crystal Hearts you can find underground give you <NUMBER> max health . So , fighting the Corruption boss . I think you have to fight him at night but I honestly didn't ever check time of day and didn't have an issue . You'll be so far underground when you summon him that you can't do much in the way of an arena , but there should be a long horizontal corridor right above the shadow orbs . The boss is just a huge version of those annoying burrowing worms , so you want to try to get in the air a bit to see him coming . Build a platform or find a naturally occurring one , it's not a big deal . Like I said , I find the Vilethorn to just destroy this guy . It basically makes a slow moving thorn that does a piddly <NUMBER> damage , but each piece of the thorn lingers for a few seconds . Each section of the boss has independent health , so if you shoot your vilethorn straight into his head as he comes at you ( or just at a good angle so it goes pretty straight down his body ) it will hit like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> sections of him depending on his speed . This will wreck him quickly . The only issue is mana usage , and you'll run out until you start killing sections , but once you've done enough damage to kill sections they will drop items that restore <NUMBER> mana and you'll basically continually refill mana as you destroy him . If you do run out of mana you can just run up and smack him with a sword . Keep health potions to chug if you get hurt , but avoiding him isn't that hard . You should get enough shadow scales and demonite from him to make full Shadow Armor , which is a big upgrade in defense from Gold armor , and to make a Nightmare Pickaxe . If you don't , just blow up <NUMBER> more shadow orbs and fight him again . Also , killing shadow orbs has a chance to cause meteorites to fall . You can mine them with your Nightmare pickaxe to make Meteor Armor ( which is low defense but has special attributes ) and the awesome Meteor Hamaxe , which fuses your Hammer and Axe into one item and is way more powerful than the Demonite equivalents . Okay , after that the Dungeon will probably be your next trek . I think you could do the Jungle at this point too , but the Dungeon gives you way more shit way more quickly . To get in you have to fight Skeletor . Technically you can go in without killing him , but try it and see what happens ;) . To fight him , you talk to the Old Man NPC out front of the dungeon entrance at night . This takes way less prep and ballyhoo than the last boss . Try to make a long , straight platform to fight him on . Generally I just level off the top of the dungeon and extend it with wooden platforms . If you have Shadow Armor your <NUMBER> % movement bonus will allow you to stay away easily . The boss is a giant skull with two detached hands . He will float around swinging his hands at you most of the time , and will sometimes "" roar "" and then his head spins and flies at you . During this time his defense goes way down , I think , and he's super easy to hit . If you've been fortunate enough to have a Goblin Invasion already you'll probably have a Harpoon , which is ridiculous for this guy . The Harpoon is a unique weapon because it autofires when you hold down the mouse button and it will fire the instant the harpoon returns to the gun ( you'll know what I mean when you get one ) . This means you can stand next to something and hold down the attack button to attack it <NUMBER> times a second . You can just run in front of Skeletor while he's spin-attacking you and rack up absurd damage . If you don't have a harpoon , the easiest to get weapon is a Demonite bow with Unholy arrows ( which are crafted from normal arrows and the worms ' teeth dropped by Corruption enemies ) or fire arrows . You can also go for guns . If you got a Musket from a shadow orb then an Arms Dealer will move into an open house . He sells the Minishark for <NUMBER> gold , which is a ton at this point in the game and will make it a pain to get for a new player . If you do get one you can use plain musket balls for ammo or you can craft meteor shot with musket balls and Meteor ore . The Minishark is an automatic gun that will demolish anything pretty quickly but eat through ammo . You can also craft a Space Gun with a flintlock pistol ( sold by the arms dealer ) , meteorite ore and fallen stars . It's a gun that uses mana instead of ammo , but if you get full Meteor Armor it is free to use . That's a shitload of money and / or time , though , for something you can get done with a bow . Once you've destroyed him , you can enter the dungeon . It's got a bunch of chests and a ton of enemies , traps , etc . You'll get some really cool stuff in there , though . At that point you can take on the Jungle or Hell . The Jungle offers some unique equipment , like an upgraded grappling hook , but hell offers Molten equipment ."	NOT

4809	uncensorednews	"lol u zionists are such liars . Even those snooty brits called Palestine ... PALESTINE when jewish terrorists were blowing them up with IEDs . "" Jewish Terrorism and the Modern Middle East "" <URL> "" ... an the contemporary Middle East conflict itself , in which terrorism plays a prominent role , be traced to a successful terrorist campaign ? I argue that Jewish terrorism in 1940s Palestine was both tactically and strategically significant . At the tactical level , Jewish terrorists were able to erode the ability of British security forces to control Palestine . Strategically , that persuaded Britain to withdraw from Palestine , which , in turn , created the conditions that facilitated both the founding of Israel and the creation of an Arab-Palestinian diaspora . The consequent Arab-Israeli conflict has shaped and dominated Middle East politics and diplomacy for much of the last <NUMBER> years . Thus , Jewish terrorism left the region with a dual legacy of tactical effectiveness and strategic influence . This article explores and assesses this dual legacy . ... . On the tactical front , they used innovative terrorism techniques to reduce the country to chaos , thereby making Palestine ungovernable . At the strategic level they expanded the armed struggle to Europe and Britain , and conducted an imaginative propaganda war against Britain in the United States that frustrated British policy efforts . Together , these two fronts undermined the British will to remain in Palestine . . The attack on the King David Hotel in July <NUMBER> was a devastating blow to the British administration in Palestine . The bomb had blown up the Secretariat , which was responsible for much of the day-to-day work that kept the government – and the country – functioning . It took the lives of twenty-one senior civil servants and of many junior staff , such as clerks , typists , and messengers . . While the insurgents relied on "" tried and true "" terrorist tactics , such as bombings , assassinations , and sabotage , they offset British military advantages with tactical innovations of their own . The road network and the British Army "" s vast pool of motor transport gave them freedom of movement throughout the country . The insurgents reduced British mobility with Improvised Explosive Devices ( IED "" s ) disguised as mile-stone markers that blew vehicles off the road and killed or injured their occupants . The insurgents regarded these as their most cost-effective weapon . They also placed bombs in abandoned vehicles . British police stations were heavily fortified , protected by high thick walls , so in at least one attack the insurgents blew up a station with a massive truck bomb ( vehicle-borne IED ) . <NUMBER> ( Edit : Now we know where those wahibbist fanatic terrorists got the idea of using IEDs and truck bombs on Murica soldiers ... from the JEWISH terrorists blowing up / MURDERING up british in Palestine during the <NUMBER> ' s . RIP Limey soldiers . ) . When the British passed death sentences on convicted terrorists , British military personnel and civilians were abducted and held for ransom . Two Intelligence Corps sergeants were executed by the Irgun after a mock trial . Their booby-trapped bodies were hung in an orange grove ... Man the palestinians freedom fighters could learn a thing or <NUMBER> from those Irgun , hagannah , Lehi jewish terrorists that were blowing up / murdering innocent british soldiers & innocent palestinian civilians in Palestine back in the day eh ? "" Cambridge event on ‘ how terrorism created Israel ’ pulled "" <URL> "" ... Published in October , the book was commended by Baroness Jenny Tonge and covers the Deir Yassin massacre in April <NUMBER> , where more than <NUMBER> Arab villagers were killed in their homes by Jewish paramilitary groups Irgun and Lehi . .

The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare , however , since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries . In fact , the verses urge offensive warfare , in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city ( which they later did ) . Verse <NUMBER> thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's rule ( ie . Muslim conquest ) . The use of the word "" persecution "" by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution ( idtihad ) - and oppression ( a variation of "" z-l-m "" ) do not appear in the verse . The word used instead , "" fitna "" , can mean disbelief , or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation . This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned "" until religion is for Allah "" - ie . unbelievers desist in their unbelief .

4980	milliondollarextreme	"I think in some respects it would be of great value to legalize psychedelics in a fashion similar to the way it was administered in the <NUMBER> ' s with lowkey , guided sessions . While the stigma still stands , psychedelics do in fact have a ton of potential for healing people who have anxiety / depression / or are just generally stuck in their own heads . I wouldn't say it's even close to the same realm as google articles that say shit like "" CBD heals little girl's autism and cancer "" when in reality weed has very little medical relevance aside from being a slight painkiller . While the boom of psychedelia in the late <NUMBER> ' s was interesting , the manner in which it went down was not necessarily cautious or beneficial for the image of psychedelics ( namely due to people like the merry pranksters and Leary ) . The explosion of psychedelia happened too quickly , and the hasty mobilization towards social change and upheaval was probably pretty fucking scary to our government so they illegalized it very quickly after . This may sound corny , but having a large group of people in the US that skew towards allocentrism rather than egocentrism ( in this case due to psychedelic experiences ) are not good for profit margins . Profit is gained through maintaining disparity , and essentially the fight between good and evil is one of spiritual and material wealth / power at odds with one another . I don't mean to say that wealth is ultimately evil but rather that those in positions of wealth and power are more wont to do shitty things to stay in such a position . None of this is to say that I'm unhappy with the position of psychedelics currently , as the internet has made it immensely easy to get a hold of such things--especially with this new market for what are essentially legal analogues of LSD under the guise of "" RESEARCH ONLY--NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION "" . As an aside I'll mention that LSD / psychedelics are generally one of the only drugs that has actually made me want to stop taking any other drugs ; and at least for me they are a good catalyst to start improving your life if you're letting your mind get in the way of what you truly want to to do and be .

The fallen angels are in chains of darkness until the end , and everyone was wiped out by the Flood leaving only Noah and his three sons , the founders of the principle arch-races Japheth ( Whites ) , Shem ( Asians ) , Ham ( Africans . ) Sadly it is true , even written in their own histories by their own hands that early on they turned to worshipping the daimons ( literally this is where the word demon comes from ) and that is where all the manner of their libtard degeneracy comes from . Their Neopaganism isn't new , it's just old failed ideas remixed because they're too stupid to read the ancient sources for themselves . As for man being gods , yes indeed the context both in the New Testament and in Psalms indicates man is born as gods , as man is made in God's image , and woman in man's image . It's the first lie and a recurring lie from the dragon called Satan that is prevalent in all pagan religions stating that they can become "" gods "" if they do this or that evil thing . Whereby they do testify against themselves that they are not gods . Jesus came to restore mankind to their position of godliness . So we can see Jesus refuting the Jews very well whom accused him of blasphemy while they themselves ironically were the ones blaspheming not just the Lord's anointed , but even themselves . As for claims that Christianity is Judeo based , that is nonsense . Clearly before Judah ( father of Jewry ) was Japheth ( father of whites ) and Japheth believed in God and was blessed by God . The True God is the God of the whites from the very beginning . Furthermore Judaism teaches contrary to the Bible , even contrary to just the Torah alone .

5350	europeannationalism	Juncker vows to use new powers to block the far-right The EU will isolate and use sanctions against any far-right or populist governments that are swept to power or presidential office on the wave of popular anger against migration . Jean-Claude Juncker , president of the European Commission , made clear at the weekend that Norbert Hofer would have been frozen out of EU decision-making if he had been elected president of Austria . “ There is no debate or dialogue with the far-right , ” Mr Juncker said . Under powers given to the commission in <NUMBER> , he can trigger a “ rule of law mechanism ” for countries that depart from democratic norms by putting a government under constitutional supervision . Ultimately , a country can be stripped of voting rights in the EU or have funding blocked . In a test run for the new EU constitutional powers , the commission has issued unprecedented orders to Poland , instructing the newly elected right-wing government to bow to Polish judges who have struck down laws passed by the parliament . Mr Hofer had alarmed the EU by threatening to politicise the office of Austrian president by wielding powers , never used before , to trigger national elections at a moment most favourable for the far-right Freedom party ( FPO ) . “ You ’ ll be surprised at all the things that are possible , ” he said before the vote . Though he lost narrowly , Austria witnessed the biggest far-right surge in Europe since the Second World War . The FPO is the largest party after the collapse of the Social Democrats ( SPO ) and People ’ s party ( OVP ) , the centre-right and centre-left parties that have ruled Austria between them since <NUMBER> . Mr Hofer repeatedly threatened to use presidential powers to dissolve the current SPO-OVP coalition government , which is racked by turmoil . He said in a newspaper interview in March that , as president , he would dismiss the government if it did not stop the influx of refugees , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> of whom reached Austria last year , and if it failed to alter its economic policies . Mr Hofer carries an Austrian-made Glock 9mm pistol because , he explains , of “ uncertainty ” caused by Muslim immigration . The FPO deputy leader is regarded as more moderate than Heinz-Christian Strache , the party ’ s firebrand figurehead , but his views are every bit as radical . In beer hall speeches he has railed about the “ invasion of the Muslims ” . Mr Hofer has warned that not all the refugees who have come to Austria are friendly and that some “ are prepared to cut off another person ’ s head ” . The EU faces the rise of other far-right parties , including the National Front in France and Geert Wilders ’ s Freedom party in the Netherlands . The deadline passed yesterday for Poland to back down in the government ’ s confrontation with the constitutional court . In January Frans Timmermans , the European Commission ’ s “ first vice-president ” in charge of humans rights , announced that he was triggering , for the first time , the EU ’ s “ rule of law mechanism ” over Poland . Talks have remained deadlocked since then as Beata Szydlo , the Polish prime minister whose Law and Justice party is affiliated to the British Tories , has grown increasingly enraged at lectures from Brussels . The row began when President Duda of Poland , who is allied to the Law and Justice party , refused to swear in three constitutional court judges . Then , in March , the constitutional court struck down a law rushed through parliament restricting the powers of the judiciary over the Polish government . The government ignored the ruling , provoking street protests and condemnation in Brussels , with the looming threat of an explicit EU diktat to Poland instructing the country ’ s parliament to back down . Hungary , which has also been criticised by the commission over constitutional questions , has pledged to fight alongside Poland to defend parliamentary sovereignty . The EU ’ s determination to head off and to keep in check far-right and populist governments could backfire . Witold Waszczykowski , the Polish foreign minister , said that the new powers went beyond the terms of the EU that his country joined in <NUMBER> . “ This is not the union , not the kind of membership that we have agreed to , ” he said .

Hell , BLM already has white blood on their hand with the Dallas killings and no one talks about that shit anymore .

It doesn't discredit their math . Of course it doesn't discredit their math , because their math has something going for it independent of it's creators .

5681	uncensorednews	This is very true . One of the main reasons that the Labour Party have been fervently against tightening up regulations relating to postal voting is because of the Party's relationship to the Muslim community . In many Muslim households in the UK , the family patriarch votes on behalf of all the female members of the family using postal votes . Voting on behalf of someone else is illegal , which is why postal voting is used to skirt the law . The Labour Party has courted Muslims so strongly in part because if they secure one vote for Labour ( the patriarch's ) , they will secure an entire family's - it's an easy way to pick up votes . Dependence on the subjugation of womens ' rights in order to ensure votes shows exactly where Labour's values lie - not with working British people , but with whatever it takes to keep itself in power .

So you are okay with him repeating his religious savage non-sense and hate speech , but defend him since he is not actually living in an islamic country , even though his religion commands him to further the advance towards islamization of non-islamic countries ? Personal take : if we hold standards to such extent , anyone who reads a religious book out loud should not be allowed to speak at any public place since all these books talk about God's punishment for some random thing Tolerant people should not tolerate the intolerant . We in the west should keep our safe space safe from totalitarian or authortiarian ideas . Especially not if we have a GIGANTIC immigrant subculture in our countries that is very susceptible to that .

5769	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) .

What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers .

5919	sjwhate	It doesn't exist in a vacuum , but it doesn't exist within the bubble of culture . It has grown , historically , as something independent of culture . Unless you see culture as something that envelops the whole of human thought , ( in which case we wouldn't have had revolutions and rebellions ) , science is not culture . Science is a study of natural phenomenon . Science is a system of higher reasoning than blindly following culture . I don't see the two of them as being very much related at all . Cultures never adopt scientific methods because cultures are groupthink while science , as with Nobel and Lister , exists sometimes in spite of groupthink . Edit : / u / triggermethis read the last line . I addressed that science exists irrespective of culture . Indian kings were scientifically educated , not the masses . The masses were given a simplistic explanation and expected to tolerate it because they couldn't read . Kind of like today where you can't read and censored me for it , but I'll live . / u / cashcow can't argue with that . If we'd stayed pagan / animist , we'd never have had science . There are still animists in the East . And the West has begun accepting pseudoscience .	EXP

5922	europeannationalism	Contrary to popular belief , Vichy France was not a puppet state of the German Reich . Yes , France was put under occupation by the Germans and put under an armistice and tributary . A real example of a German puppet state would be the Bohemian protectorate . Vichy France was an independent nation led by French Nationalists and Philippe Pétain who came into power by filling the vacuum the old regime created when they fled France . The purging of Jews , Communists , etc . were done under their own orders to appeal to the Germans . I wouldn't call Pétain's government a truly National Socialist state , or even a fascist one . It certainly was a nationalist one , and a reactionary one . Pétain very much emphasized the importance of going back to a time before the Liberalism of the French Revolution , the old French traditions , the Old Guard , so to speak . However , economically they weren't really fascists .	EXP

5945	uncensorednews	every time a bubble pops it's still above the last time the bubble popped . Just because there's up and down doesn't mean up and down are equal and for the last <NUMBER> years up has out-paced down . Hence , net long-term growth . Which is even worse as that second ( third , fourth , fifth ) , bigger bubble doesn't restore the lost value but instead simply pumps more of that money into the line of fire . Let's take an example from that infamous housing bubble shall we ? Take real estate with an actual worth of 40k . Now , because housing in that area is trendy in <NUMBER> , you're easily able to sell your house for 100k , because dumb fucks can be trusted upon to do dumb fuck things . The Millers buy this property for 100k and , because they have no damn clue how to handle money , take up some hefty mortgages . Life's easy , the economy is booming , your neighbourhood continues to be in high demand , everybody has money and is willing to spend it so your new property is deemed very low-risk by Dumbfuck Bank and the Millers get great interest rates . Because the Millers are dumb fucks who can't handle money , they take up more and more debt as it's very cheap and spend it on useless stuff with no lasting value , like sports cars or luxury goods . Then boom , something happens . Let's say the local lake turns out to be contaminated with radioactive substances . It's all over the news and within days , your trendy neighbourhood goes from \ <NUMBER> in demand to dead last . Dumbfuck Bank sits down and discovers that their risk management is now completely off - mortgage rates up for everybody . Oopsies , now the Millers ' monthly rate went from <NUMBER> bucks to <NUMBER> bucks and they can no longer pay the interest rates on their mortgage , let alone paying off the mortgage itself . Turns out they're going bankrupt . Dumbfuck Bank starts seizing assets to cover their losses . That real estate they valued at 100k before turns out to sell for 41k - well shit , where can Dumbfuck Bank take the other 69k from ? Turns out there's nothing to salvage for Dumbfuck Bank - they have to cut their losses and pay those 69k out of their pockets . As a consequence , Dumbfuck Bank stock plummets . But wait a minute , Smartfuck Insurance had previously bought Dumbfuck Bank shares to do investment banking with retirement money they have at their disposal - well shit , now that's going belly up too . Now , if you keep repeating that scenario , and even increase the amount of money on the line , things won't get better . They'll get much MUCH worse . Yes , the bailouts could have been handled better . But that was because of lobbying , not because of the system . It doesn't matter for past generations why things happened . They happened , and as a consequence the money is gone . The ' why ' matters for current and future generations only because that's going to be the next gambling money . If the funds do run out , they'll do so before I'm old so it won't be us who get the short end of the stick and we'll be able to diagnose the problem and make a better system . What the fuck kind of logic is this ... Of course you get the short end of the stick , because YOU're going to have your taxes increased in an effort to restore the money those companies owe to your elders ( or , alternatively , the system collapses and you'll have to foot your old man's retirement home bill all by yourself ) - and on top of that , you have to put money on the shelf for yourself . If you're not old now , you're THE target group because right now , you're the money maker generation .	EXP

For comparison , Russia spends about <NUMBER> % , and the UK about <NUMBER> % . The reason the spending is so massive in absolute terms is that the American GDP is so large .

5961	sjwhate	He did not make any demands . He gave points and evidence to show that google may have been wrong in their assumptions on the disparity in numbers . If he had demanded that they agree with him and follow his rules then I could understand that may create an environment where they couldn't work together . ETA This is exactly what google are doing . You must agree with what we think is happening in the world , or shut the fuck up , or get fired . He attempted to help his company with evidence and improve their understanding of a subject . He made no immoral demands or statements . There may be good reasons to fire someone for things that they say . But if you held a meeting with your employees and then afterwards one of them said , look I listened to what you have to say , and I would hope you may consider these alternative view points . Then you would probably agree firing that person would be a little unfair . If you are running anything with an ideology rather than an open mind then I'd say you were creating an environment for everyone of your staff to have no option but to agree with it or risk being fired . If google thinks that is a healthy way to treat their employees then that's up to them . I agree that society is more important than a corporation in terms of its attitudes effect on a population . The point about google being able to hire anyone according to the image they want is kind of legit and kind of not . Any company should hire whoever they feel is best for the job . If they are hiring people based on who they are or what their skin colour is , then it's a racist practice . If googles ideology is to have everyone who works for them to be Indian , and nobody else can work there , they do not have the right to force that to happen . Ideological practices are what cause problems , rather than logical and factual reasoning . Which is what the person was trying to explain . Google didn't like this , because it's exactly what they are doing . you don't have a right to terminate someones contract just because they don't agree with you . If I come into work tomorrow and my employer said , look , we think that men are a rape risk and so we're going to have to make you all work in the same room . If I disagree with that idea they can't fire me for it . Workers have rights too . I'm not sure where this stands legally , but this whole should they shouldn't they fire him is blurry . I think the main point here , is that he did not say anything sexist or racist , he used evidence and reason , he suggested that he would like feedback and other ideas , but google did not want this . Their response was , what he said is incorrect , google does not believe in this so we fired him . That response is lacking in so many ways .	EXP

6199	fatpeoplehate	"There is / was a whale pod at my gym . Fortunately I have figured out what time they all go so I can avoid them pretty easy . But for the first few weeks I was hitting up the gym with my SO when he would finish work ( he finishes much later than I do so we would go for evening weights about <NUMBER> - 8p m ) There is about <NUMBER> fatties who are doing one of the "" <NUMBER> WEEK BEST BIKINI BODY BOOTCAMP "" programs with one of the lady trainers . When I say trainers , its really weird at my gym , they don't have lots of "" employed "" trainers but I think trainers are allowed to design their own groups so long as they pay their own membership and people attending their group pay a $ <NUMBER> visit fee each time and / or possibly sign up for membership themselves . The bootcamps are an extra cost which participants pay directly to the trainer because they're not making an income off the gym owner . The lady trainer is BUFF , total beefcake babe who caught me mirin a few times . She actually approached me and asked about my weights routine and made a comment , something along the lines of "" Wish these girls would take on the weights but they don't want to get big "" with a flick of her sweet ponytail towards the fat fucks . This struck me as really odd , considering the trainers appearance was an obvious result of lifting heavy things , but when I thought about it later maybe she was actually being super sarcastic and was a super shitlord . I watched the whole bootcamp routine in the mirror as I was getting ready for my next set and realised that all the hams were fawning over the trainer and she was literally screaming in laughter at their comments . The next few times I saw this group I noticed some of the hams wearing knee or elbow braces , like those pull on ' tube sock without the toe ' looking sleeve things . After a few weeks the number of hams decreased or their "" injuries "" became so bad that they couldn't ( wouldn't ) do certain exercises . Keep in mind majority of the exercise was cardio based , row machine , bike , cross trainer etc . But nothing like plyometric ( jumping etc ) or anything that should be done specifically with a trainer unless you are a bit special in the head and / or need assistance with basic movement . By the 4th or 5th week the group was down to only <NUMBER> hams . She still had a super cheerful banter with the remaining two fatties and as my SO was going to leave ( I was off re-racking my weights like a good little pup ) SO over heard the trainer talking to some other hams out the front of the gym . They were saying something about signing up to another boot camp next month . When I jumped in the car my SO made a wise crack about me joining their bootcamp and "" making friends "" ( he knows I despise hams ) and I couldn't help but notice the trainer standing beside her car ... counting $ <NUMBER> bills . In Australia hundys are super recognisable , they're long and fucking bright green . It clicked . This trainer would put on these <NUMBER> week "" bootcamps "" and have people pay up front ( she had likely just signed up the two fat fucks at <NUMBER> sessions , for $ <NUMBER> per session for <NUMBER> weeks , additional FREE session to entice a sale ) She would know that the hams are in no way dedicated ( as I witnessed through their drop off rate ) so up front payment was fast and easy cash . She also probably knew she wouldn't have to put that much effort into making a routine for the boot camp and all she had to do was laugh at the all the fat fucks "" quirky "" jokes . She got her cash , gym go their cash / direct debit membership , hams fucked off after <NUMBER> weeks and a whole new set of hams rolled on in . Don't get me totally wrong , I will applaud anyone making efforts to better their lives providing they are committed to push through . But this is an exact behaviour of a fucking obeast . They think they can get the "" bikini body "" in <NUMBER> fucking weeks ( ONCE A WEEK SESSION FOR <NUMBER> MINUTES ) they have this beautiful trainer who is chatty and laughs at all their bullshit and doesn't "" judge "" the . Then they stop going , some wont even attend the full <NUMBER> sessions .

6496	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right ( negative freedom ) or far-left ( positive freedom ) social politics . But since , neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject , it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents , objectives and constraints . Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them .

FLASHBACK : <NUMBER> INT NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ is beautiful , just <NUMBER> , and quite pleased with herself because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her . RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , <NUMBER> , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT
6614	battlefield3	With these suggested foregrip changes , guns with high horizontal recoil will be unusable in close quarters ( this includes g36c , g53 , A - <NUMBER> , qbz - 95b , f2000 , famas , aek - <NUMBER> , kh2002 ) no matter what you attach into them other than a crap bipod . And attaching a bipod to carbines listed above is just retarded since it takes <NUMBER> bullets to kill on longer ranges ( something that I'd never understand ) . Even if you tried to attach a heavy barrel next to foregrip to these carbines , you'll just have to resort to your pistol in CQB as an engineer which shouldn't be happening . Alan Kertz will kill any run & gun play there is on close quarters with these changes and everybody will have to use low horizontal recoil weapons if they want to do so like m416 , m16 , m4 with either a suppressor or laser without foregrip . Suggested changes will basically make everyone start using the same weapons without foregrips or bipod then he'll come back here and bitch about everyone using the same <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> weapons as Assault and Engineer and not attaching a bipod or foregrip . He'll probably keep continuing by nerfing those since they'll all be overused by then . Making foregrip reduce horizontal recoil by <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> deg on all weapons gotta be the worst idea this guy ever suggested . My bet is that it'll be in the next patch since he's basically screwing the game over and over again every patch .	NOT

There was only one place in the entire room where you could view the "" carpet "" , a three by two foot section in front of a floor mirror where she would sit and apply makeup every day . Needless to say , I put "" carpet "" in quotations earlier because what you could view here was technically carpeting , but no longer the mauve color like in MY room , but a mottled splattering of reds , pinks , browns , tans , and blacks . The rest of the floor was covered in dunes of dirty clothes that measured between half a foot to two feet thick in places . It was like walking on a water bed when I would have to trek through her room to collect all the dirty dishes when I had nothing to eat on . Our cat , angry at life and at her , would periodically pee on her clothes . and cover them ( like a litterbox ) . One would think that this would entice her to clean ... but no ... she would just live in the stink and I was eventually forced to retreat entirely to my bedroom in the back and keep the door closed with the window open . When she moved out , I had huge plans for her spare room . I was going to put in some workout equipment , make it a nice man cave . So I rented a carpet cleaner . thirty minutes , one broken steam cleaner , and a 3ft by <NUMBER> ft patch of clean carpet later , I was overpowered by the smell . I closed the door , stuffed towels in the gap and walked away . When I moved out five months later I went to the office and turned in my key .

6744	OperationPullRyan	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section <NUMBER> ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section <NUMBER> renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year <NUMBER> to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section <NUMBER> modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section <NUMBER> , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section <NUMBER> requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section <NUMBER> before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section <NUMBER> could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section <NUMBER> requires the President to submit a report to the Congress <NUMBER> days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section <NUMBER> further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section <NUMBER> , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

6752	atheism	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following : The training and certification that teachers go through . Thereby , the recommended teaching methods . The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability . A broad control over what gets taught , in the form of a curriculum . A teacher's conduct , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would you like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in general are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

There's a reason fighting is super effective against dark ( that is , dark doesn't play by the rules ) . Moves are primarily physical based , which to me implies a sense of doing things the old fashioned way - the one who is the strongest makes the rules . Neutral good - Flying types . They're paired with almost every other type out there , implying they can get along with just about anyone . Resistant to fighting , so if they don't feel like going along with the rules , they can easily fight back . Several legendaries are flying types , so they can act however they wish too , on their own personal level rather than being bound to follow the rules . Chaotic good - Dark types . They play by their rules , not those set by others . Physical attackers , so they don't have to have a plan , just do any move and hope it hits . May not always get along well with the team , but they have their useful place . <NUMBER> Elite Four members use them , but no gym leaders - perhaps giving a sign of their usefulness , but also difficult part of being involved in a team . Lawful neutral - Bug types . The life of a bug is simple ... larva - [ cocoon ] - final form . Grow quickly , and follow the order - no questions asked . True neutral - Probably Normal types . Since they aren't super effective against anything , it seems to be that they are just there , trying to make their way in the world . Chaotic neutral - Psychic types .

6846	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" .

The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule .

7150	boardgames	no , not really . Most of the games I play end up being two <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> points , and one <NUMBER> or fewer . However , it's usually very easy to tell who is going to have the <NUMBER> points . A few things I've gathered over many games : People who get development cards generally win . The more you have , the easier it is . The robber helps the player with development cards win . The player with development cards is also often the player who can get cities easiest . There are <NUMBER> ( and sometimes <NUMBER> ) points that often rapidly change hands <NUMBER> / 3rds of the way through the game ( longest road and largest army ) . It's usually easy to predict this . For example , the longer a development card sits in front of someone , the more likely it is to be road building / monopoly . At least , with my group . Trading becomes much less ... innocent , the more frequently you play with someone . There are <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> people I play with who are very , very cagey with their cards at this point . We rarely will trade <NUMBER> resource for just <NUMBER> other . It's usually at least <NUMBER> for <NUMBER> . This is heavily influenced by who has the best position ( not who is currently leading ) . Finally , if you aren't first or second to secure a solid position on the board , you are likely out of the running for the game unless you get very , very lucky . - - - who can make the most devious trades at the end We almost never trade with people who have <NUMBER> points . It's too easy to give them a win by accident . The only exception is when trading gives you a victory first ( which means they won't trade with you ... ) find the most creative way to get that last point . There are really only two ways : development cards , or brute force . Brute force is just out spending your opponents ; lots of cities , settlements , and roads ( for longest ) . This is harder when people realize what you're doing and robber you up . Dev cards you've been planning for several rounds , and everyone already is wary of you . You probably have largest army , a road builder card , maybe a monopoly ... It's harder to defend against . I probably play too many boardgames ... this post ended up being longer than I intended . :D	NOT

7280	milliondollarextreme	"But you can't honestly say that this "" US cultural dominance "" wouldn't be a thing without black people . Because you really don't know since thats not how history progressed . I'm not saying that white people wouldn't come up with other forms of music if the US was hypothetically homogeneous , but it would be derivative forms of less musical styles and be developed from stuff like classical music and folk , and there would be less of it . If you have less styles of music to be inspired by , you end up having a culture that has a narrower type of music that only really appeals to the people in said country , and it would not be able to have the same widespread influence it would have otherwise . Japan is less than half the size of America , almost entirely homogenous , and their art and video games are appreciated throughout the entire world . Are you really going to tell me that diversity is necessary because it adds discourse so we can make new art ? I think you're underestimating how much japan is influinced by american culture , the classic anime art style is influenced mainly by disney , J-pop and K-pop is undeniably american influenced and is clearly not traditional in any way , and much more . I'm not saying that there's no Japanese element to modern Japanese culture but part of the reason why Japanese culture is so widely liked is because it's a combination of american and Japanese culture , do you think people in western countries were giving a shit or paying any mind to Japanese culture before WWII ? It has an appeal because it's similar , but unique at the same time . Most of asian pop culture is westernized american culture , but with more of an Asian / collectivist mindset . Also have you been listening to the discourse lately ? Have you seen rap videos and listened to rap music lately ? It's divisive , just like diversity . It calls for violence , it taps into anger , and ironically it can be pretty racist as well . All pop music is divisive , so is rock music , EDM , funk , disco it's all divisive in a way , especially rock music . You have to be blind to not see how voilent and intense rock music both in the past and currently , just look at metal , and punk , and post punk , and hard rock . If you're seriously saying that then you don't know what you're talking about . The fucking sex pistols for example had lyrics about rape , abortion and sexual submissiveness ."	EXP

7282	fatpeoplehate	They did an experiment on some morbidly obese dude in which they put him in a room hooked up to an IV of essential vitamins and minerals and saline I think , then just let him sit and burn off all his excess calories . Definitely something that would be hard to re-create but it actually worked - the guy lost all of his weight by just sitting around . He probably also lost a good bit of muscle too but you can always re-build that . Anyway , my original point was this chick could do the same thing . It'd probably take a year or so of just sitting to burn all of her excess fat , maybe more I don't know .

7292	sjwhate	I wasn ’ t trying to say that one is more corrupt than the other ... I just meant as far as my own person perception of the two parties .

The previous two elections with Obama , I was just a young kid . I think I had barely turned <NUMBER> when he first ran for president . And his second turn , I was still young and naive . This last election though was the first time I got really involved in the political process . I foolishly thought that the Democratic Party was the Party looking out for the little guys , the normal every day Joes ... and I thought it was only the Republican politicians that were looking out for the interests of the wealthy elites . But after this last election ... there weren ’ t any more delusions about the Democratic establishment . I ’ m no socialist but I do believe our Crony Capitalism has turned us into an oligarchy . I personally feel there needs to at least be some government oversight and regulation ( although that comes with its own problems ) ... because right now these billion dollar corporations are buying out politicians and giving themselves free reign to fuck us all over .

7405	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

Just this one sample of three physically obvious afflictions contains three very different and unusual ones , which one almost never sees in person . I believe I would stare at least a little bit , too , if I saw a man with no arms or legs on the bus , but after seeing ten morbidly obese people shuffle by me on my way to said bus , seeing another ten on it wouldn't exactly blow my mind .

8015	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money .

Imagine if motivational speakers were allowed into schools and told children it's okay to be proud of your body , whether that's black or white or brown , male or female or some other gender concept , tall or short , smoker or non-smoker . Imagine a world where smokers justified their bad behavior by saying that people in the past smoked , so it's okay to do it now ... that people in the past had it right , they were real men / women back then because they smoked . Imagine a smoker screaming at his / her doctor for saying , "" You are a smoker .

We realized it is a public safety concern and banned it in public areas . Cigarettes are still available . An adult can choose to smoke if s / he wants to . These are not intended for children , and insurance premiums are higher for smokers due to their increased chance of needing surgery , medication , and other treatment . Some people still choose to smoke . Some people choose to smoke and quit later . Others smoke for the rest of their lives .

8372	IAmA	Oh you play ? Yay That's so cool I'm not a goalie unfortunately . But I have seen our goalies doing a lot of fun drills . I think it's important that you focus on your leg strenh and reaction time . Our goalies do land drills with tennis balls to work on their reaction time . For example , stand facing a wall , a few feet away , and get someone to stand behind you . Get them to toss the tennis ball at the wall so it bounces back towards you , and you can try to catch it . That will help you with your hand / eye coordination , and your reaction time . And they do leg strenhening with jumping drills in the water . For example , have your coach hold a stick , or pole above your head in the water , and have you jump to touch it while he moves it to different positions . As you get better he can move it higher / farther from you , and you can do it for longer periods of time . There are a lot of good American Universities that offer scholarships . If you're good ( which I'm sure you are ) ) you'll get noticed with scouting . You could always make a highlight reel of some of your games .

Do people remember what things were like before multiculturalism ? You might still have similar levels of petty crime , but it wasn't as bad before . There's a dangerous criminal element that has grown in London and cities with brown skinned 2nd generations . Immigrants from Eastern Europe integrate better . And for all of our imperfections as humans , we still separate into tribes , it's ingrained in our DNA . Skin color plays a big role , in addition to culture , etc . In the next few decades , you will see less support for welfare programs from the general population . Taxpayers are ok with higher taxes when it's a support system for their own kinfolk . This is playing out in Sweden right now , where the Swedes don't see these newcomers as their own countrymen , so they are less in favor of high taxes to support services for them . It might help if they integrated better , but many groups don't care to . Thus exacerbating the problem . I'll be awaiting your response of , "" Well there's not much we can do about it now , these people were born here and are British .

8538	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

In cases where people support abortion past the first Trimester and some support it until the baby is out of the womb . I'd be fine with this . They get to kill babies , fundamentalists get to kill them and I have logical consistency along with one hell of a TV special . The human brain isn't fully developed until somewhere between <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> months after birth .

The ones that think you get to kill something if it's taking anything from you should be pretty intense Libertarians and should support things like shoot to kill as self-defense if not in general shoot to kill if you're compelled to provide your being against your will or otherwise forced have your life limited ; taxes come to mind . If it's the responsibility and <NUMBER> year work load being pushed on them then they should support financial abortion for the fathers and in general be against the notion of child support ( the father could of course still help out financially but it and the amount wouldn't be mandated ) .

However , when you are descended from a slave or someone who got their city firebombed in the 20s by the Oklahoma national guard ( Look up Black Wall Street ) , it's tough to have as much growing up . So while things seem unfair these days with affirmative action etc . I understand why . We may not have de jure racism anymore but there is still de facto racism . Trust me as an Asian it feels bad to have my masculinity neutered due to media perception . Not the end of the world but I could do without it . I can't imagine what blacks go through . I hold up a bag of weed to the window to see it in the light and my black friend instantly closes the blinds , I didn't even think about it . When you're a black senator and get pulled over six times a month for months on end , it must be frustrating . I know people aren't racist . I go to quaint mountain towns and see white , black and Hispanics getting along just fine . However , in those cases , they all share the same "" culture . "" The black kid is not from the hood , the Hispanic kid is not from Mexico or at least spent their early childhood in the US after immigration . What whites are afraid of is a cultural dismantlement of their values . It's more vital than ever for both sides to understand where each other are coming from because it's extremely difficult when you're from one side or the other . I've been friends with people who've marched in BLM rallies and propose going to the UN for sanctions against the US . I've also been friends Georgia rednecks , wall street republicans and the like . There is a legitimate rational fear coming from both camps . Both sides fear the same thing , that they can't defend themselves from the other side , that their future has been endangered .

8788	uncensorednews	Well , let's be fair : the effects of slavery on blacks in America are still being felt to this day . The argument that only blacks have been persecuted by slavery is , of course , farcical , but you lost sight of the real problem . <NUMBER> years ago , slavery ended . But only <NUMBER> years ago did systemic discrimination of blacks finally come to an end . It would be naive to assume that the socioeconomic status of blacks in contemporary society does not owe their past treatment blame . Don't get me wrong , the liberal trend of demonizing whites and elevating blacks without any regard to the state of their community has done terrible harm to race relations , and progressive attitudes , but you can't beget ignorance with further ignorance . Blacks are in this position due to past white supremacy , but the answer is not to lay blame on current whites , nor attempt to shift the balance of power through affirmative action or unequal treatment , as most liberal policies tend to strive for . The solution requires a much more nuanced and harsh look at both sides , and addressing problems from within .	IMP

EXP
8794	fatpeoplehate	Feel free to PM me about non-subreddit related questions . There's already a bit of a backlash on certian aspects of fat acceptance . Chiefly , the ' I want to be fat but get a hunky male ' type of fat acceptance . There's a lot of criticism in the feminist community of figures like Megan Trainor who promote fat acceptance at the expense of skinny girls . That said , I don't think fat acceptance is going to be completely dismissed as a topic in the near future . There's too much intersectionality with other popular discussion threads . Women tend to be judged more on their physical appearance than men are . Women in fields like science , education , politics , etc . are criticized if they're not attractive enough . ( Or if they're too attractive and thus must be a ditz . ) Women are criticized more for having abnormal body-types than men . ( Buff women considered ' gross ' and ' mannish ' , waifish girls are ' boyish ' ' twigs ' or ' skinny bitches ' , and fat insults ) . A guy can be skinny , buff , or fat and receive fairly little criticism on his body type . Those are just to brief examples , but you can see how it'd be easy to take a ' fat acceptance ' slant to these feminist issues . I think the best way to disassociate fat acceptance isn't by completely removing it , but by focusing on more important issues instead . There's way more serious issues that deserve attention , and they should be discussed . Women of color , trans women , abused women , women in power , gender vs sex , history of feminism , how feminism effects men , etc . There's a reason you can major in this , it's a huge subject . There's so much material you can cover , fat acceptance can easily take a back burner . Elimination via omission , rather than actively booting them out is liable to be most successful .	EXP

8810	askscience	"Well , here's the rub : it's not really sensible to talk about the mass of an individual bound nucleon ; the mass you refer to ( where a proton weighs a little less than a neutron ) is for a free neutron or proton . When nucleons come together to form a nucleus , the process gives off energy - - and the system loses a corresponding amount of mass ( E = mc ^ <NUMBER> ) . So if you think about the "" mass "" of a proton in a carbon - <NUMBER> nucleus , it is smaller than for a hydrogen - <NUMBER> nucleus ( i . e . a free proton ) . This is what is referred to as the "" mass defect "" and , when you convert it to energy , indicates the "" binding energy "" for the nucleus ( which is the energy it would take to blast the nucleus apart into its component free nucleons ) . So what you should think about is that when you have a beta decay , the creation of the emitted particle consumes a fraction of the energy released by moving a nucleon ( and thus the nucleus ) to a lower energy state . The rest of that energy is usually carried off as kinetic energy ( of the beta particle / neutrino / nucleus / Auger electron ) and / or a gamma ray . In fact , this interchange of mass and energy is what enables us to predict whether a nuclear decay will occur ! If the decay decreases the total mass ( of the nucleus plus any particles it emits ) , we know that it also releases energy and thus is moving "" downhill "" towards a more stable system with a higher binding energy ."

I've never claimed that you're adding anything . all authentic hadiths have to be put under the microscope . Indeed , which is exactly what I've done to present the position used by fundamentalists to justify all manner of horrific behavior . You can jump up and down and deny everything all you want . This will not remove Hadith from circulation nor stop them from being studied by Muslims in their effort to emulate the prophet . when read correctly Oh boy .

The real tragedy is , that your argumentation is the same as the one of muslim orthodoxy and extremists fundamentalists . Now you're getting the picture . Perhaps you should be reviewing these issues with them , yes ? I don't think you'll have much luck , since we've already established that <NUMBER> % of the shit that they're up to is completely condoned under reverence for Muhammad . Fortunately the arabic language allows detailed linguistic analyses ( a point in my previous post , you chose to ignore ) A couple of problems with the "" The Qur'an must be read in Arabic to be understood "" argument . First , this would assume that the <NUMBER> % of Muslims world wide who do not speak , read , or write Arabic are not Muslims at all .

8966	sjwhate	White people invented a few theories of racism primarily to justify mass slavery but both slavery and forms or theories of racism have been around for a long time , on and off all over the place . Brief summary of history : In Europe slavery was limited in a lot of places , sometimes illegal or frowned upon . In terms of a large scale international slave trade from Africa the Muslims really started that as a largely eastward trade . They also took a large number of slaves from Europe . Eventually in response to Islamic aggression the pope authorised the crusades which pretty much said do unto them as they do to us and this dragged on for a while . Europe was quite isolated at the time and because of the nature of how things worked then it was a bit of a cluster fuck . Europe was neither well organised or worldly so the crusades became essentially a war against outsiders . It was not really easy to entirely identify who the enemy was either . The invaders attacking Europe were also not fully solidified as a single easily identifiable foe . Do the same unto them also meant taking them as slaves as they had taken our people . At some point along the way the crusades lead us to often becoming like our foes , going on expeditions to ransack and pillage . We basically ended up doing as they do but also a lot better at it for various reasons . It's also the kind of thing that can spread like wild fire . In a competitive world everyone has to do what ever anyone else does that gives them an advantage to stay afloat . Once the ball is rolling though greed starts to take over . I've compacted the history quite a lot but it really culminates with the Dum Diversas and the discovery of the new world . Suddenly Europe , in particular Portugal had discovered a massive amount of easily captured and cultivated land but had very little in the way of people to hold the land , settle it and work the land . I don't know the exact order of events but that led to sourcing slaves from Africa especially since Portugal had a blank check . There had been slavery before but the discovery of the new land brought it up into a scale that was unimaginable that the entirety of Europe got dragged into . While Europe was actually not entirely for slavery in general it was overlooked because of the massive gains at the time , huge rush to capitalise on the new land , otherwise one nation that didn't do it would quickly fall out , because of the Papal approval or because it was far away and out of sight among a number of other reasons . Back to point , the moral backdrop of Europe wasn't such that you could just do slavery not only on that scale but to some of the extremes so a number of arguments come theories emerged to justify it . Some might have been in the works already for those accruing riches from conquest but the slave trade brought the necessity to a whole new level . Those theories didn't really count for much ultimately as it was white people that were the primary driver for changes that improved the lives of black people bringing them increasingly more equality as time went by . People today are obsessed with scientific racism but forget that many of the theories of that time were Biblical . While science might have certain things to say about different races science does not some to moral conclusions where as religion does . Anyway the history of mankind has long been a dog eat dog world . If anyone is alive today it's because their tribe , race or species brutally wiped out another . What white people have done in history to others is nothing beyond universal human nature . Really the biggest crime of white people is that they rose up to top dog in such a world . Retrospectively you can always say that the top dog could have done things better but in reality when judged by reasonable standards that take into consideration all other factors white people really weren't that bad in history and could have been far far worse .

As if ... they all had sensed a passing ice cream truck break down in the summer heat . Instead , upon hearing the words of the voice and its wisdom , they all suddenly decided that the disembodied voice is right ! They should all just deal with the struggle and lose the weight . I wish the above was the case but sadly this is just not reality . Your post has the right attitude but not the correct delivery . A normal regular reasonable person does not allow themselves to even get to the point of obesity . Many of these people are just plain crazy and deluded . Sadly the number is increasing and it is not just because of a modern luxury and convenience society . It is because there is fat acceptance . Where most would avoid becoming fat for the obvious reasonable reasons such as health issues others merely avoid doing so because society does not like the overweight . Suddenly there is this accepted notion that it is okay to be obese , that it is something that cannot be changed , and even that the obese can be beautiful . We cannot save all of these obese from sad miserable short deluded lives ... that is the reality . But the least we can do is prevent those right on the edge from falling over to the dark , I mean , fat side . People criticize fatpeoplehate and think we're bad people but honestly we care , and we see the situation for what it is . We understand that perhaps the only way to help some of these people is just plainly to show them hatred and disgust . To show them that we do not agree with the fat . Because in good conscious we cannot sit down and support the mass suicide that others claim to be known as ' fat acceptance ' This post , although it has the right attitude doss not work because those who would see this info logically and realize they need to lose weight already have . Or , haven't gotten fat in the first place .

9277	swtor	How do you get PvE gear ? A good start is just to PvP and trade Warzone Commendations for Mercenary Commendation and buy CHAMPION GEAR BAGS ( <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of each commendation ) . You can get lucky and get PvP modded gear that is ilvl <NUMBER> ( mods ) . Otherwise crafting is really good , take green level <NUMBER> items and reverse engineer them to the artifact quality . Get really good rolls and you can get triple secondary stats on them - only really sacrificing a bit of the main stats . Which to be honest isn't super big deal losing <NUMBER> STR when you gain <NUMBER> PWR instead . What's a Flashpoint and how do you find them ? Flashpoints are instances that are <NUMBER> - mans and have their own story and bosses , generally dropping better loot than quest rewards or crafting . You can find them in the Fleet stations , generally in the Drop Station of each larger ship . There are two on Ilum . What's the difference between a hardmode and a normal ? Boss ability wise there seems to be no difference between normal and hard-mode with the exception of a couple bosses now spawning adds . The major and most important difference is that every boss now gains an ENRAGE timer ( + <NUMBER> % DMG ) . So most of the bosses become a DPS race and healers should be DPSing whenever possible ( I recommend telling your tank to blow a cooldowns and bursting a good amount in that time frame ) . Most of the bosses are pretty easy and not super different from normal mode , some of their ability do not even increase in the amount of damage Trash is much much more difficult , highly recommend CC . Anything with a bestial animal seems to do crazy amount of damage as well as the elite robots not being a joke . How do you get gear tokens ? Final bosses in hard-mode flash points drop Columi gear token which seems to be the early raid equivalent . Otherwise as stated above CHAMPION GEAR BAGs house the PvP gear which is an excellent as well as solo-able gear up process . How do you get PVP gear ? ( And highend PVP gear ) By doing Warzones Stack up commendations ( <NUMBER> is the current cap of every commendation it seems ) , while leveling and PvPing you can get an entire gear set from the Fleet PvP vendors at levels <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> . If you have excess Warzone commendations convert it to Mercenary Commendations to prepare for an easier time gearing up at level - <NUMBER> . Gear bags contain either A ) <NUMBER> Centurion Commendations B ) <NUMBER> Centurion Commendation AND <NUMBER> Token for Champion level gear . Centurion commendations are used to buy the lesser Artifact gear for level <NUMBER> . There is also two PvP dailies as well as two Weekly quests . ( Win <NUMBER> Warzones & <NUMBER> Warefforts for the daily . ) ( Win <NUMBER> Warzone & <NUMBER> War efforts for the weekly ) Completing these will give you <NUMBER> bags per day and <NUMBER> per week . War efforts is taking part of Ilum PvP which is the far West part of the planet , you must destroy the enemy tank walkers and their battle station ( OR repair your turret at the base - there's a console at the base of the turret which fixes it ) Where are the daily quest hubs ? You must finish your main class story to do dailies , at least I'm fairly sure . First hub is in Ilum , there is another hub on Belvaius - generally someone in fleet will have a new quest informing you they need aid at a certain planet .	NOT

9329	GradSchool	If you're above the cutoff , then don't sweat . I'd say prove yourself by taking more advanced courses and doing well . You're close to the average , so no worries Clinical programs tend to be more like medical programs than do other psych programs - they're more about the numbers . So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US .

The fact that there is no evidence linking Hitler to the Holocaust just like there is no evidence linking OBL to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> : - - - Here is why the Wannsee Conference remains contradictory as it did decades ago . <URL> Even Jewish Journalists renounce the authenticity of the Wannsee Conference . As Jewish Lobbies continue to invest enormous efforts in dictating and imposing a rigid and unquestionable Holocaust narrative , Israeli Haaretz published a short , succinct and courageous report challenging the validity of the Wannsee Conference as proof of the Nazi ‘ final solution ’ . Just ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day , the Israeli paper reported that Dr . Norbert Kampe ( <NUMBER> ) , director of the “ Wannsee Conference ” Memorial Centre in Berlin , has challenged some of the most widely-accepted historical ‘ facts ’ associated with the conference and its meaning . Jewish Holocaust scholars have always insisted that the master plan for the Nazi Judeocide was conceived at the Wannsee Conference but Dr . Kampe is quoted as saying that the conference dealt only with “ operational matters ” instead of being a platform of any form of “ decision making ” . To prove his point , Kampe pointed to the fact that Hitler and his ministers were not present at the conference . Furthermore , he says , “ At the time , January <NUMBER> , there was no organized plan for extermination camps . ” And yet , Haaretz admits : “ Make no mistake . Kampe is not anti-Semitic . Certainly not a Holocaust denier . On the contrary . As expected of a professional historian , he studied countless relevant texts , documents and testimonies on the particular event … His conclusion is the direct outcome of an educated analysis of written material in his possession . ” So courageously , a Hebrew paper praises Kampe and his “ fascinating historical lesson ” and also acknowledges that the Israeli Ministry of Education lacks the capacity to engage in any form of informed Holocaust debate . Haaretz clearly admits that “ to this day no one knows with complete certainty and confidence what exactly happened on <NUMBER> January <NUMBER> , in this pretty villa in the wealthy suburb of Berlin . ” Only one copy of the Wansee Conference protocol , found in <NUMBER> , survived the war , others having been deliberately destroyed by the Nazis in an effort to conceal evidence . This protocol is the only authentic documentation as to what happened in Wannsee and one of the few that made explicit use of the term “ final solution ” . However , Haaretz concedes that , like any historical document , the Wannsee document should be read carefully . The words “ death ” or “ murder ” do not appear in the conference protocol . Instead , it refers to “ natural diminution ” , “ appropriate treatment ” , “ other solution options ” and “ different forms of solutions . ” In fact , the only explicit references in the document deal with deportation rather than extermination . Even the famous table attached to the protocol that counts the Jews in each occupied country , does not state that those Jews are destined to be destroyed . Just a few days ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day , a Hebrew paper found the courage to admit that “ decades of Holocaust research could not find a clear and explicit command made by high-level Nazi officials to engage in systematic mass extermination of Jews . ” According to the Israeli paper , the Nazis disguised their true intentions in some “ ambiguous orders and “ secret codes ” , which were supposed to lead officers to interpret and to react upon what they believed to be Hitler ’ s will . The moral here is simple . Once again we learn that some Israelis are far ahead of the Western press and academia in their criticism of Jewish ideology in general and the Zionist Holocaust narrative in particular .

You're really going to have to spell this out because you stopped making sense with this saddam shit a while ago . I don't even know where go to from here with that , so I'll just re-state my original position using simpler language . After ww1 germany was angry . They were hurt really really bad after they lost the fight and then the people who won the war forced them to sign a really bad deal that bankrupted an entire generation of germans . They lost their money , their land , their army , and they were really really mad . They wanted to get back at the people who they felt had hurt them , so they happily supported an angry nationalist party who promised to get revenge on the people who hurt them . A bad man named Hitler said ' I will help you get your revenge against the people who hurt you ' The general german population already did not like the jews , who they blamed for hurting them in ww1 ( look it up ) so when Hitler said ' I will hurt the jews for hurting us ' they said ' yay ' and helped him freely and enthusiastically . These days germans feel really really bad about this , and don't want to believe that grandma or grandpa could ever _want_ to do the horrible things that the german government did to the jews , so they say ' it was never grandma or grandpa , it was all Mr Hitler's fault that this happened . ' and then they don't feel so bad about themselves . They want to ignore that anyone could ever be so angry that they could support the murder of an entire group of people . They don't want to believe grandma or grandpa could look at a whole group of people and label them as sub-human . So they pretend it didn't happen . And now you're doing it to the arabs .

9945	uncensorednews	"Ah yes , this comment reeks of bigotry . So I'm just going to get out in front on this one . Here is my retort to this bull-shit argument as a middle class well-behaved white person . If you found a video of that occurring you would more than likely be pulling from one of like two sources . first would be in europe , and fuck europe , those people are all drunks , and europe has no bearing on american racial politics . First , way to judge <NUMBER> million people . Once again , you judge a whole group of people based on the actions of a few . second would be a trailer park in alabama , now , you kind of have a point , but the main difference is we ridicule these people viciously ourselves , and knowingly try to avoid that . Way to only judge the south . There are white people all across the country that stir up problems from all levels of income and walks of life , but this is really besides the main point . you black folks don't do that , we never see BLM people out calling out some black trash for dealing dope in the hood , and stealing all day long , we white people have daily battles in pop culture with how shitty white people are , in the news , on the radio on the way to work , we deal with it daily . Way to assume my race . I'm white and the funny thing is I never feel like I'm being targeted for my race because I don't live in a false reality . I don't know where you are getting these ideas . Answer me this , have you ever been victimized in person , not online , for being white ? Second , have you ever treated someone different in person because of their skin color ? Chances are the first has never happened and you are probably guilty of the second . Next , since apparently it is so widely discussed in the media that white people are the worst , can you give me just one reference form the past week from the mainstream news or media that backs up this claim ? I doubt you can . we never hear steve harvey on the radio telling on some black guy for talking shit about another race , steve harvey himself is in the news for being racist against asian men ... What is with this idea that if someone is black and a celebrity it is their job to bring upon themselves to try to fix racism in this country ? What an asinine argument . Second , Steve Harvey rightfully received backlash for his comments . Third , no one is saying black people cannot be racist . And the people that do are racist themselves . So what is your point ? But nobody gives a fuck , its not on the front page , why ? Oh but people do . These types of posts do make it on the front page . Remember what happened in Chicago a few weeks back ? They made the front page for like two or three days straight . Also , right wing media definitely cares . Oh they get off on this stuff because their viewers love to hate on topics like this and get riled up anytime they feel even the tiniest bit of unfairness , just like you are doing in this thread . I swear , right wing sites ran BLM smear articles every week of <NUMBER> , even when nothing had happened involving that group . Anytime someone that is black says something stupid or anything remotely in the realm of racist , oh they are there to talk trash about them , misrepresent a peaceful , awareness movement ( that has admittedly had a small portion of people stir up trouble and misrepresent them ) , condemn a whole race , and generally beat a dead horse . The first thing you wanna scream about is how "" You can't judge us all . "" why can't we judge any of you ? You should judge someone by the content of their character . It is that simple . So what is someone is black and from south Chicago ? That does not mean he's guilty and involved with the crime statistics of the area . If we start treating people like this , then that means I can label you for the worst of the people you can be associated with . Funny how this is lost on so many people like yourself . For people like you , it's all okay to racially profile someone until it gets turned around back on you . Are you from a rural area ? Must be stupid and married to your cousin . Are you white ? You must be racist . Female from the coast ? SJW feminist . Black ? Thug . Male from the center of the country ? Redneck . Hispanic ? Illegal that doesn't pay taxes . There are million different ways we can assume the worst of people . The irony is you are so fussy about this perceived hate and judgment towards white people , but yet you argue that should be able to judge others . You are such a hypocrite . But you see , this double standard is why you are a bigot . the second a white cop stops a black person for something its immediately racism , and not the fact you are wearing the uniform of a gangster . No it isn't . No one is saying this . If you look like a gangster and are only stopped because how you are dressed , that is racial profiling . You'd be pissed if the same happened to you . Oh by the way , do you remember the guy that got stopped for a broken taillight , told the officer he had a concealed weapons permit and the gun in the car so not to alarm the cop , and the cop still shot him when he was pulling out his car insurance information , all the while his wife and baby were in the car watching ? What do you say about that ? You assume the worst of blacks . You really do . The strenh of your argument is based on how poorly you look down on them , which is why you are blind to the good the people in the black communities do and stand for . You are also so blind to the failures of the white communities , unless it's Europe I guess ... There are good and bad people in both groups . However , you only see what you want to because it helps justify your narrow-minded viewpoint . The point im trying to make is nobody in the black community takes responsibility for anything . Takes a responsibility for what ? And yes they do . If you look for it you see it all the time . Here are some stats for you though , not that it will do you any good . You perceive black communities as this crime ridden filth that takes no responsibility for its actions , however apparently whites are such a beacon of accountability . What you don't notice is that the crime you focus on is product of poverty , not race . When you compare race and the same levels of income , crime is virtually the same . That means the same percentage of low-income whites are involved in the same percentage of crime as low-income blacks . However , when being sentenced , blacks receive harsher punishments for the same crimes and number of offences than whites . What do you say to that data ? You should step out of your white-only world and start talking with minorities of all races about these issues . I think then you may have a better understanding of this whole situation . Sincerely , A knowingly privileged white that's tired of hearing the stupidity from out-of-touch whites about race relations and how they are now the "" most mistreated group "" in the U . S ."	EXP

10030	sjwhate	To be fair , we did all we could to undermine them as well by blocking international trade and effectively besieging them . Capitalism works well because it's antonymous . That's also capitalism biggest weakness . It can go rogue and snowball out of control . Like socialism , whether it's fair or not has to be taken on a case by case basis . There's no perfect system . It's self regulating reasonably well but not flawlessly . The establishment is a legitimate issue in capitalism . For example you make a great chocolate bar and make lots of money because people like it . Now you have so much money that you can make another chocolate bar but this time you mass advertise it . You give it a leg up and make it an artificial success . Things becomes less dependent on the product itself . This is a form of inflation . People get what they deserve for producing but then can use that reward to inflate itself and get more reward . It's an exploit in the system . You have a number of processes where if you don't apply the right level of regulation to capitalism wealth can continually be drawn from the people at large into the hands of a small number of people . Sometimes capitalism isn't necessarily related to skill or the work you put in . It can come down the the luck of the draw . Socialism requires a significant micro-management burden compared to capitalism . That might change with the advent of computing but it wont solve everything . The level of micromanagement needed to accomplish true socialism that's also productive and successful is quite high . Communism loved its mega projects but couldn't accomplish as much if you divide the same effort into thousands of small scale projects . They also had a habit to embark on half baked mega projects and large scale management . Socialism has problems because it often avoids giving better contributors and people that are more skilled recognition for it . Hybrid systems tend to be the best with regulation for capitalism . Both systems can lead to inequality and unfairness . However much genuine inequality and unfairness there is , unfortunately , you'll always have ten claims to the one legitimate claim . People will lie if that raises their position and they can get away with it . Both systems can have serious moral issues if gone awry . I like some ideals in socialism in principle because I have a natural work ethic and passion to be productive . A lot of the pressures capitalism imposes are for me redundant . They can actually get in the way of being productive . I'm not representative though . A lot of people just don't like the pressure for the sake of it . The pressure is needed to motivated them to contribute to society and have a good work ethic . Many people are delusional about their own intellect and abilities as well as their ability to contribute to society . In reality it often turns out their biggest passion is themselves . Without passion in constructing and building things , solving problems , acquiring and applying knowledge , improving things , discovering things , etc then there's really little to motivate someone . The majority of people or a large portion , those that are representative of the type that might be pro-socialism , appear largely social . As in their existence is all about depending on the tribe . Evolutionary behaviour biology comes into play with this . Originally in a tribe you needed the effort of several members and could only afford a little slack . As farming developed one person could provide for a hundred ( ballpark figure ) . Since then people just had to be socially acceptable to get by , to not be rejected by the hand out system . This is likely why the human brain has been shrinking for thousands of years , humans are likely losing the parts not related to socialisation while socialisation is being selected for . By far and large the majority of people are not really producing anything but surviving with sufficient social skills . It's all in the name . Socialism . Other people just don't do very well in a meritocracy based system . They are afraid of losing the game . If someone is self-centred , they are likely to blame the game rather than the player if they don't come out on top . Alternatively they blame the winners for cheating . Not that those can never be true . That varies . It's more that out of what can be true , these people pick to believe or claim what is self serving . They have no loyalty to the truth , only to themselves . Many others are pretty much really just jealous thieves . You can never say never , there should be an effort to have things reasonably really distributed . However the kind of extreme socialism or social justice many people demand doesn't attack extreme elitism or real injury to the person . Instead they just want more and mathematically if you on average have less than half the wealth per person then evenly distributing it will make those people better off . They just want what you have . Socialist ultra egalitarian doctrine is a way for them to achieve that . For people who have worked hard in capitalism to earn their wealth then that is unacceptable . You'll always have this oscillating between those two extremes and it's one of the reason politics will always be bi-polar . In many ways Kim and Castro are not in the same boat as Stalin ( he's big in the meme for a reason ) . Socialism can work a bit better for a smaller country because of a smaller management burden . There's just less to deal with , smaller system , less divided attention . The positive side of Castro is what they did to be self dependent . Both Castro and the North Koreans developed a philosophy of national self-reliance . That's comparable for Cuba to when Germany tried to cut off Britain in the second world war . That's one reason people here are sentimental about the story . In a way they are more protectionist and nation first than the USA . This evolved from a mixture of the collapse of the USSR that satellite nations were dependent on and that the USA also has ensured they are cut off from much of the world and have as much an international trade disadvantage as possible . The USA actively does what it can to set them up to fail . Despite the incredible burden and cost versus just giving into the USA they have just about clung on and stayed alive . The expectation was that the satellites would also collapse . That they managed to cling on as much as they did despite the sacrifices and odds was shocking . On the other side of that , Castro was a relic , over confident and in many ways barbaric . Stalin was a relic as well . The appreciation of this used to sometimes be reasonable in the more left leaning circles . The pro-Castro thing used to be an expression of dissent and disagreement with our own government ( it was a kind of a fuck you statement ) . These days the left has gone complete cuckoo and elevated him to deity status . Fatty Kim as amusing as he is really just inherited a situation . We're so obsessed with just cut the head of the snake belief as a means to win a war or conflict easily that we never try to look beneath the surface . These things are rarely about one person and there's rarely really a side that's truly in the wrong , usually both have legitimate points of view . North Korea has food problems due to a mixture of natural disasters and their own attempts to manage farming without having as sophisticated knowledge as we do on the matter to get it right . It also keeps large stores of food in case of war which raises the food burden . What we're doing with that is actually morally dubious . We have an ultimatum to North Korea . Basically if they surrender unconditionally and let us take control then we give them food charity . They say no surrender then we accuse them of starving their people because of that . The situation in North Korea is bad but right now it's our attitude that is unhelpful and that will not lead to peace . We're still following a policy of there can be no substitute for victory . No one of consequence is looking for an avenue towards peace that doesn't require North Korean capitulation . That's sad because despite the food situation North Korea is a pretty amazing country , there's nothing like it in the world , nothing that has remained so immune to the spread of globalisation and global influence . As long as the stand off is resolved , the arms race scaled back and so on then I don't see what it matters to us who rules or if they are socialist or not . It's their business . Americans should value North Korean national independence as much as they value their own .	EXP

Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

10207	worldnews	I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally . If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

10318	uncensorednews	First thank you for giving me a reason to look into this . It's been interesting . This is not going to be the best arguments , but I found it interesting nonetheless As I dont have the software to quickly search court cases I had to slog through crap . In \ <NUMBER> . You can easily make the argument without need for federal precedent that these rules were invoked as a form of selective punishment as almost every student breaks these laws on a daily basis . By simply having their phones on in their pocket . And that the school administration used it to target this guy . I think it gets thrown out easily . Earlier I was making the argument for defence from the professor , not the school and I was incorrect to try that direction . This is from the school and not the professor . As to \ <NUMBER> . Legally , The 2nd court of appeals ruled in <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> - cv Caro v . Weintraub that “ We affirm , and , in so doing , hold that the exception to the one-party consent provision of <NUMBER> U . S . C . § <NUMBER> ( <NUMBER> ) ( d ) requires that a communication be intercepted for the purpose of a tortious or criminal act that is independent of the intentional act of recording , ” But that's legally and I am not sure this applies in this case . Though I think it or something close to it should hold up against the teachers union if they go after the student . A petty argument is that this was not done on tape . And that the rule is outdated and no longer applies . If I searched way longer than I feel like I could most likely come up with some precedent . Also nitpicky , all you would have to do is find a few incidences of this occurring and show no response by the school to also make it look like a subjectively and maliciously applied in this instance . And in this day and age of facebook it should only be an afternoon's work to find material . You make the very good point that these rules were signed off by a lawyer and I agree . But I believe from the wording that it was done in the <NUMBER> ' s or even earlier and the school has been negligent in updating them with new vernacular and context . This was fun nonetheless .	EXP

Even if the emails were the only bad thing about Hillary there's enough stuff in them to get her convicted to multiple felonies . Of course there's far more than just her emails , like the hidden cam footage of her campaign admitting to rigging elections , for starters . Also remember that Hillary has been a politician probably since elementary school and has a lifetime of training and experience with how to present herself , and answer questions . Trump has always been the brash , aggressive business man type , even if he's only posturing . He doesn't have experience in politics and therefore doesn't automatically jump into robot politician mode whenever he talks . Of course Hillary's going to sound more "" presidential "" when she speaks - she's been groomed to do so for decades . She's given all the answers before hand and still has a hard time competing against a "" bumbling idiot . "" That's pathetic . That's like a NEET getting his ass kicked at Halo by a girl who hasn't played video games before . Oh yea and the "" dozens of assault victims "" that came forward , coincidently during election crunch time , aren't that believable when many have already recanted their statements , and one ( or more ) have admitted the DNC offered them money to make false claims that Trump sexually assaulted her . On top of that , other accusers have been paid by the DNC at some point . Don't forget that Anthony Weiner's wife has a high paying job on HC's campaign ... I don't want to address each point I was just pulling things out quickly from my head , but i'm sure most of what you wrote can be debated as well , if not simply proven false . I don't believe Trump is some angel whose never committed some type of crime or done shady shit , especially since he brags about doing shady shit , but to pretend like the things he's done is worse than HC is just stupid . oh yea and one more of your points that just came back to me : he was right to imply the judge might have a bias seeing as how a lot of Mexicans were really mad at Trump .

I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since <NUMBER> has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in <NUMBER> I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then . I didn't like the Patriot Act , but the sunset clause made it ok . I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant .

I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the <NUMBER> dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden . When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food , he changed the old bathroom into a pantry . This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store <NUMBER> months of food for our family . We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country . If not , my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways . We could have kept on doing what we always have . I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad . I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received . I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than <NUMBER> washings . I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline . I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat .

So the fast food companies all started to try and save face .

The media kept crying out that people would eat healthier if there were healthier options available at these restaurants . Dude , I am NOT kidding you . nobody buys this shit at McDonalds . I remember throwing away countless salads and yogurt at the end of every shift , because no one was buying it . Yes of course , the occasional hambeast would buy a salad . But they would usually ask for two or three extra packets of ranch and a few extra packets of croutons rendering the salad virtually useless . Instead of supersizing their fries , they just buy two mediums now . Everyone declared victory when McDonald's bent to their whims regarding changing their menu .

10607	uncensorednews	While I disagree that it's a comparable issue to women in combat units , I agree that lowering standards to fulfill a political agenda is utter bullshit and ultimately costs lives . There's a lot of sexism in the form of special accommodations for females in the military - fitness standards being the most glaring . IMO those standards should be job-specific , not sex . It doesn't make sense for some desk-jockey at Finance to be held to the same fitness standard as something our Security Forces personnel ; it makes even less sense for a chick in SF to be held to a lower standard than a dude in Finance ... like , what the flying fuck . I digress . The whole trangender thing imo would be more comparable to something like homosexuals in the military ; they represent a pretty strong deviation from the norm , but not necessarily in a way that interferes with their ability to do their job . Their brains are almost certainly wired differently , but using that as a basis to bar them from military service all together seems unnecessary . Perhaps there are things they're inherently worse at - okay , limit them from career fields dependent on that trait ; but if that's the case , there are probably also things they are better at than the average Joe - we should identify what that may be and allocate our personnel accordingly .

But you made green haired , horse pig college girls care because pandering causes controversy , controversy causes press , press causes attention , and attention causes profit . The Hollywood machine is run by people who pretend to be liberal by making liberal decisions , but who are more capitalistic than anything . All of these college girls who have Funko Pops of The movie version of Wonder Woman sitting on their desk , they're all being played like a fiddle ... It's just incessant pandering / propaganda . Diversity , or ideologies third wave feminism that are excessively injected into media , is being used as a weapon to indoctrinate kids and other knuckle daggers who just don't know any better . And there's a growing market for it . Pop culture has become a Trojan Horse . And the shitty part is , the left is actually right on the Hollywood casting system . It's sort of built on a decades old , paradigm that is unintentionally racist . It's just based on fear of producers not making enough money back . There's allot of factors to it . It's a BIG fucking stretch , but it's the only tangible evidence of systemic racism out there . It's a stretch because there are allot of individuals factors involved and it barely effects anyone . Max Landis has done a video talking about it . He's a fag .

11345	uncensorednews	This is exactly what I'm talking about , congress can't fix it , laws can't fix it , and white people cant fix it . If the black community is going to move forward and reduce problems like violent crime , unemployment , high dropout rates , fatherless households , and so on , they're going to have to be the ones to fix it . Looking outward to fix the problem is what has been going on for years and is the main reason the problems are still as prevalent as they are , and unfortunately any black person that mentions that they as a community need to address these issues , they're immediately called a coon and an Uncle Tom by other blacks and told that they're doing softshoe for whites and they need to shut up . So I don't really see things changing any time soon .	EXP
11346	fatpeoplehate	Hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism and Graves disease are all fairly common in my family . During the initial stages of the disease you either gain a lot of weight very quickly or lose it very quickly . Then the doctor puts you on medication and begins working on the proper dose . During this time you will gain weight for the most part ( though my uncle lost weight until he looked skeletal ) . The medication is adjusted until crazy weight gain / loss is controlled and the person is then expected to live a healthy life and lose the extra weight or gain back weight until they look human again . PCOS can cause difficult weight loss but doctors work with you to try and help you work with your body to lose it since the condition is exacerbated by being overweight . Also autoimmune treatments when they put you on steroids cause weight gain . It is expected though that once equilibrium is reached you lose the extra weight . This is why I hate hearing about condishuns . :/	IMP

Most guns generally have much more range than they did in BC2 . There are also various attachments that effect range . Hit registration is much improved than BC2 ' s . BF3 doesn't suffer BC2 ' s sniper hitboxes . What you are most likely complaining about is the lag compensation . There are many ways to handle lag , but generally the best way is to prioritize the shooter's perspective . At least , to my knowledge . The old maps could have supported <NUMBER> players if they added more spawn points all of these features were possible before they just restricted them . Oh god no , that would of been terrible for the console port that BC2 was . Bad company's mechanics were made for <NUMBER> in mind . Even <NUMBER> players was pushing it . Heavy Metal is probably the only map that could fit that bill anyway . Your argument for why it is different is that they released the game they promised <NUMBER> years ago and labeled everything that should have been in the last game as a new feature They never promised <NUMBER> players , jets , etc . they promised a sequel to Bad Company .

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

11659	uncensorednews	"You think the US government is trying to get the country to hate whites even though it is made up of mostly older white men that want to stay in power ? That makes no sense Turns out a lot of those are Jews . Also intra-white competition and conflict is very much a thing . Upper class liberal whites strongly dislike prole whites . I asked for a link not some statement that you could have easily pulled out of thin air I linked to Colin Flaherty above . He's pretty good or you might like [ Stuff Black People Don't Like ] ( <URL> Or just read the sort of studies that looks at crime and pay attention to what the definitions actually means . Clearly you don't know the definition of a hate crime , because a "" crime "" done in defense is not a hate crime . That's my point . White hate crimes are inflated due to self defense being counted as hate crimes . Here's [ an example ] ( <URL> There was a demonstration by whites driving cars flying the confederate flag . One car got an engine failure and was stranded outside a black party . The blacks got hostile and surrounded them and the man brandished a shotgun to get them to back off . The white couple got <NUMBER> years in prison for flying gang colors and terrorising people . This despite several police officers present who saw no need to intervene . the news also tries to make hate crimes against black kids acts of "" defense "" I honestly believe there's not been a single case of that happening in the US in the last <NUMBER> years . Feel free to link to a case where you believe that happened . Your claim that the people that Dylan Roof murdered defended black murderers is an ignorant and blind assumption so I'm not even going to argue with that . Ok . Why do you think it's taboo in the black community to talk with the police ? Or why there's always black people to speak up for black criminals claiming they did nothing wrong and were just about to go back to college and get their life together ? Nobody did that for Dylann Roof . "" The primary cause of black suffering is black dysfunction "" again , wildly ignorant assumption so I'm not even going to bother . The person with the most influence over your life is you . If things go badly for you it is very likely to be hugely influenced by your decisions . If you look at black behavior they hugely make poor decisions like eating bad food , not saving , not studying , getting kids early , not getting married , taking drugs , commiting stupid crimes and so on . That's mainly due to their decisions . If whites have any influence over them they're very much trying to get them to act in the opposite direction . Of course you don't want to see white people tortured , but from your arguments it sounds like you want to see your racism be justified so you want to see cases where blacks act like the "" monkeys "" you think they are Other way around . Being racist means you're a pariah and never can state your views openly . I very much want not to be racist and spent a few years rationalizing away the evidence until I couldn't . and you don't want your squeaky clean view of white people to be tainted so you only want to see them as the great innocent people they are if not the victims . I think whites are a fundamentally broken and degenerate people and it's highly uncertain whether we'll survive as anything but an insignificant minority . "" Pretty sure most blacks do get welfare ... "" hahahahahaha good argument , very convincing . Again that entire paragraph is a bunch of bs assumptions of an entirely thought up description for black people that you contrived in your head , because you are racist [ Here's a discussion on the subject ] ( <URL> You keep throwing out percentages and statistics but I see no links That's because they are my rough estimates , I'm not writing a scientific paper here and I'm certainly not spending hours googling stuff I've read at some point in the last <NUMBER> years for you not to read . I'm presenting my views in a rough quantifiable manner to make it clear what I believe , not in order to convince you . If you care about the subject , you put in the hours of research yourself . You must think of yourself and the white race sooo highly that you think that they are the sole reason that black people can survive , even though they are the sole reason why black people were enslaved and held back for many many years . Compare the blacks with enslaved ancestors to those without and tell me which population does best . Hint : not those in Africa . Also , look into Muslim African slave trade . As for the white race . Yes , we did great things and yes we were uniquely merciful to other races . It is a historical fact that the only reason slavery was abolished was that white people wanted it abolished . Every other people were fine with the institution and had no problem owning or killing other people . Whether that's a good thing remains to be seen . Currently our altruism and acceptance of non-whites is killing us and destroying our countries , so maybe it's just a weakness that will be weeded out of humanity . I'd ask for a link to support your claim about the kkk , but I know it's not going to show up . But here , I'll give you one <URL> The South was destroyed and occupied by Northerners who mercilessly exploited them and forced them into abject poverty you seriously don't see the morality of an occupied people standing up for themselves against their conquerors ?

11666	Fitness	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

11736	uncensorednews	"It's often impossible to get a restraining order quickly , or at all . And as you note , they have no effect on a person who chooses to ignore them . Victims often have no proof that they've been assaulted , held captive , and threatened with worse . And violent perps often can't be found even if their victim can convince authorities that there's sufficient grounds for arrest . Many violent perps are part of organized gangs , and arresting / jailing one of them just means they have a fellow gang member do their violence and murder for them . Some gang leaders have successfully ordered hits from inside federal prison , in some cases against "" snitches "" who are in a different prison . I'm not really sure how a lot of this is relevant , I feel we are drifting really off course . We are now talking about a violent domestic partner who is ordering a fellow gang member to kill his spouse , and yet I still think that we would agree in this situation , your average single mother probably wouldn't fare too well against a trained killer , even if armed . Why should she have to take a class ? She may already be quite familiar with guns ? Who decides what the class consists of , how much it costs , where it's held , and how often it's held ? I have a second home in a state where these infernal classes are required . I've seen ads in the local newspaper announcing that a class will be held on a certain date a month or more in the future . Even aside from cost , transportation issues , and conflicts with work schedule , that's hardly a meaningful option for someone who needs to protect themselves NOW . Like tonight . She should have to take a class because guns are inherently dangerous objects . If she is already familiar with guns , that's great , she will breeze through it . Also , this assumes that someone who is familiar enough with guns hasn't been licensed before in their life . If you instituted gun safety classes and they became the norm , you would have young adults learning alongside their parents , and they would get licensed at a young age . The issue with the scarcity of gun safety classes is that they are optional , and generally boring , so few people elect to take them , and that drives up the cost . Gun stores tend to have a lot of competition and it's not difficult to imagine a store throwing in a free lesson with a firearm $ XXX . If the store down the road charges $ <NUMBER> / class , which one are you gonna buy from ? Even aside from cost , transportation issues , and conflicts with work schedule , that's hardly a meaningful option for someone who needs to protect themselves NOW . Like tonight . This still seems like such a specific scenario you are painting . How frequently do Americans find themselves in a domestic violence scenario that is severe enough to warrant a last minute outing to a gun store ( assuming it's open ) , but not so urgent or life threatening that <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> isn't involved ? Also , when a desperate looking woman comes trotting into a gun store out of breath , saying she needs a gun TONIGHT , what responsible gun store owner says : "" yeah , this seems like a normal situation , here you go . "" They would talk to her , and get the authorities involved . In <NUMBER> , America needs its citizens to be able to protect themselves and each other from government . Just like when the Bill of Rights was ratified . When the BoR was ratified , there were no police . There were no neighborhood watches . There was no Nat'l Guard . There were no gated communities , no ADT security systems , no <NUMBER> , no paramedics , no immediate help of any kind . There were county sheriffs of sorts , but they didn't get involved in matters until it was supremely serious . Also , women had no rights , and our fictional wife beating husband could act with impunity . We also didn't have 100M guns throughout our country , and all the people who owned guns were familiar with them from childhood because they were a necessary life item .

Remember that type <NUMBER> can develop at ANY age , and women in particular are prone to developing it in their 30s ( this happened to Mary Tyler Moore ) , which is when they are at most risk for developing all autoimmune conditions .

It's important that if you do develop diabetes , you're very clear about your history with an autoimmune condition and your family's history of type <NUMBER> . Unfortunately , many adults who develop type <NUMBER> are misdiagnosed with type <NUMBER> initially and treated as such . This can have deadly consequences because type 1s need insulin to survive . <NUMBER> . If your family history for type <NUMBER> is strong , you may be able to enroll in TrialNet , which provides free screening and sometimes tests therapies for delaying onset in people who are at risk .

11855	milliondollarextreme	I highly recommend American Psycho . Forget the anti-consumerism message that everyone keeps harping . I actually believe the point of the book goes past consumerist culture . It explores Bateman's discontentment with reality . Perhaps a bit of Weltschmerz in a way , but it's honestly a bit difficult to explain . Bateman , in his mind , tries to emulate perfection only to realize perfection cannot exist . Not only does he struggle to come to terms with imperfection , but he also struggles to choose between an egoist rationale and a utilitarian rationale . His motives switch back and forth between the two rationales , as illustrated many times by the book . His hypocrisies are kinda difficult to explain , but it all comes back to inability to cope.He ' s a hypocrite . In one part of the book , he has a radical suggestion of eliminating poverty by simply killing off the poor . Seems like a sociopath's mentality and pretty one-sided . But at the same time , Bateman glorifies poverty elsewhere in the novel . For example , the paragraph where he imagines a Sudanese child dying in the desert . He believes poverty is innocence and gratefulness . Not due to their lack of exposure to commercialism , but a failing society . Bateman glorifies innocence , purity , and perfection . He's the complete opposite and can't live with that . And here's a list of books for edgy people : Journey to the End of the Night , Ficciones , Naked Lunch , Death of Ivan Illyich , Stoner , Book of Disquiet , Ham on Rye , The Bet ( All of Chekhov's works honestly ) , Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man , Diary of a Madman , Nausea , Heart of Darkness , Picture of Dorian Grey , Hunger , Fear and Trembling ( good read even if you don't like philosophy ) , Murder of Roger Ackyrod , Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime ( recommended for people with autism ) , Brave New World , The Trial , Crime and Punishment ( I recommend skipping some of the marriage bullshit it gets boring ) , the works of Camus , Mass Murder and Suicide , Madness and Civilization , Inner Experience , Sound and the Fury , and Empire of the Sun .

11945	sjwhate	<NUMBER> . Generally if people are worried to take a seat from you it could very much be your appearance . Not skin colour but what you're wearing . Literally throwing on can earphones used to ensure that I'd get asked for ID into my 20s even though if I didn't wear cans and wore the exact same jacket at <NUMBER> no one would ask me even if I bought multiple bottles of liquor . Old people fear young people and in many cases for good reasons as it is a common thing for young degenerates to beat up old homeless people or mug old people since they are pretty defenseless . <NUMBER> . Racism really isn't mainstream on YouTube unless it's stuff like Black Hitler or the SJW types spouting that you can't be racist to whites or white people cannot be X . There'll always be some people who don't suit this bill but they are cracked down on heavily these days I presume . See CloudFlare & Google literally delisting the Daily Stormer . Meanwhile anti-white hate sites like anything Nation of Islam is still fine . <NUMBER> . Asian people due to their culture tend to try their best to not be an imposition on people . You didn't offer him a seat so you're jumping to conclusions but it wouldn't be ' un-Asian ' in terms of culture to not take a seat when offered but then take one when it is vacant . You'd be surprised how often people have to entice others to eat at BBQ equivalents . Whereas in Western culture you show up and grab a burger . <NUMBER> . Continued Honestly considering all your stories I would assume you're probably big for your age , in that ' dangerous teen age range ' where people worry about sketchy teens , dress non-chalant or ' street ' and seem like someone who while obviously good natured might come off as in some way awkward ( say saying things <NUMBER> times to get heard or ' getting caught ' glancing at people in buses ) . Those things generally lead to people not sitting next to you . Simply things like putting your leg up or ' spreading yourself ' are often things that seem natural and also are comfortable but serve to signal stay away to others . My guess is you're probably doing this without even noticing it since you sound good natured and probably wouldn't notice it . Reason I believe this is because I was usually a ' dapper ' teen but I had friends who were sketchy teens . You be amazed what tiny differences in demeanor signal . The people I hung out with were often very well dressed but they repelled pretty much any adults or kids that weren't sketchy as well . They were just a little looser in all their actions and a little more careless ( they were pretty rebellious and reckless in general ) and you could see every adult , families or kids red flags go off . White culture is often strung pretty tight . If you're casual or too outgoing people get worried . Being too nice , eager or outgoing at cashier checkouts or bakeries usually gets you weird looks ( and occasional is he on drugs remarks ) regardless of where you're from / skin tone . Another final thing to consider is the odd one out effect . If you're really black in a city that's predominantly not so people will look just because you stand out of the crowd . You can see this if you travel to Asian countries and go to remote villages where people treat white Europeans like a petting zoo animal ( it's literally like the worst SJW rant come to life ) . People rush in to grab their skin to see if it is the same / real and they're referred to as whitey . They aren't racist but by the mere nature of standing out you attract some interest . It's not different to say seeing someone who is very short or very tall . You have to be able to take a step back and see that it's not bad natured and in most cases not even surprising .	EXP

12076	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

OH NO TONS AND TONS OF SPLICERS You can't get out until you kill them all "" No more sneaking down hallways , no more feeling hunted by the creepy babbling splicer whose voice bounces down the hallway so you can't tell where he is , no more feeling of being stalked by a spider slicer . Just large open rooms fighting waves of splicers all rushing you at once , like they were trying to make Bioshock : Serious Sam Edition . - The big redemption would be if you could get the DLC , Minerva's Den , but that apparently was never released for PC .

12486	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

We know what the views of 2nd , and 3rd generation of muslims are , we know that Islam had conquered big part of the world using immigration , and over-breeding . So what if it will happen to people in <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> years ? They don't deserve free secular country ? This sounds like the police ( in the UK is assume , since you ever so often quote BBC ) has a problem with doning their jobs . Your attempt to solving this could be compared to throwing out all black people out of chicago , so the cops dont shoot them anymore , instead of making the cops do their jobs properly . This problem exist in every country with big muslim population , there is no place with perfect police ( and it is especially hard when it is done by families so it gets under reported ) . The only solution would be to address the root cause of those crimes , and the root cause are beliefs of those people . Skin color isn't ideology , those are two separate problems . Which is exactly their job . Punishment after crime . Its one of the basic foundations of a free country . You cannot be punished because of a specific ethincity , religion , or because your grand children might want to introduce sharia law when they vote in <NUMBER> years . You are innocent as long as you are not guilty , and therefore deserve all the help society is giving to non-criminals . Exactly my point , this doesn't solve the problem .

I don't have a problem with people who have extra meat on them , and some of these girls are have just "" normal "" extra weight .

Edit : it seems as though my second brain has decieved me .

But it's still important to realize that these women are not all in the same life category . A few are just normal girls , and there is nothing at all wrong with that . But some are planets , and need a heavy dose of reality ( see what I did there ? huh ? huh ? ) . A pig who weighs 300lbs because she can't stay away from Pizza hut doesen't deserve to have attractive , only slightly meaty normal human beings lumped together with them .

Bernie is very far left , more extreme than a lot of Democrats are willing to go . So you've got pretty much all conservatives and a decent amount of liberals not supporting Bernie at this point . How could he be the most popular ?

12993	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

13240	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

13264	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT
13265	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM ! "" But the specific persecution of religious institutions and individuals was carried out to advance state atheism ."	NOT

13282	gaming	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging .

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

13518	funny	although I think your sister has a valid point with the whole polyjuice thing , I think there may be another series of circumstances that led Voldemort towards baldness . I think Voldemort had cancer . He constantly was searching for ' eternal life ' . Magic is a known carcinogen and , ironically , is in itself unable to cure any kind of cancer other than pancreatic . What kind of steps did Voldemort take to combat his cancer ? He was constantly murdering people to create new horcruxes , which could easiy be reckoned to a kind of magical chemotherapy . Another symptom of the magical chemo is his apparent constant feeling of chills . seriously , even the dark lord is going to get a little muggy feeling wearing black robes in the middle of July . so I think maybe Voldemort just wanted to not day of cancer . we can safely assume the Dark Lord did not have pancreatic cancer . judging by his weak voice cancer of the lungs or larynx seems like a reasonable possibility .

13521	leagueoflegends	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around <NUMBER> to cast <NUMBER> to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an <NUMBER> mana , <NUMBER> turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip with + <NUMBER> / + <NUMBER> , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : <NUMBER> multicolored mana and <NUMBER> turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost <NUMBER> black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only . Sight Ward : Wouldn ’ t even be good if it cost <NUMBER> . Maybe cantrip it when it dies ? Vision Ward : Even worse than sight ward . Cantrip ’ ing it would still make it worse than a cantrip ’ d sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward . Warwick : Suffers from the exact same problems as corki , too complicated for an uncommon , will never find a place in constructed , but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity .	NOT

Finally one of the lards went and got him . Clearly they were just to lazy to get up and tell him someone was calling ffs . This was after me calling <NUMBER> times and seriously crying on the phone because it was an emergency . I honestly believed they weren't going to get him , and I didn't understand how they couldn't fucking care since it was urgent to me and I know my boyfriend found it urgent also . He was even pissed they didn't get him because it was important , not like I was calling just to bother him . My boyfriend came home stressed every single fucking day over those lards and I hope they all die . Constantly bitching at him , making his life hell . He had to work out in the freezing cold carrying stuff , + do their work also because they did none of it , and the manager didn't even fucking fire them . On top of everything the manager gave them money to all go out eating one time , like I said it's winter my boyfriend at the time is working all day , he barely was getting enough food when he got home it was whatever was there and then bed . So he was really happy about this . They went to some place called Dennys .

He was working constantly more then he should have had to , because he was also doing those other fat bitches work him and that other guy , and he was imo getting paid shit for it , so imo he didn't order to much and he should have ordered more because that shit fat lard manager owed him more . Fuck fat people . They honestly shouldn't be hired at any job .

14032	explainlikeimfive	From simple.wikipedia.org - Conductors usually beat time with their right hand . This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries ( when they start playing ) or to show them to play louder or softer . Most conductors have a stick called a “ baton ” . It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat . Other conductors prefer not to use a baton . A conductor stands on a small platform called a “ rostrum ” . To be a good conductor is not easy . It is not just a question of giving a steady beat . A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes . They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make . They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants . Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals . They make everything clear through the way they conduct . In short , they are showing the musicians the beat of the song , and telling different sections when it's time for them to get louder or softer , or pointing out whether or not they are too loud or two soft , among many other things .

Also , this giant migration that happened today was not a whole bunch of white nationalists ... it is probably the most main stream possible sample of Reddit . This is good for both sides as debate creates solutions and a middle ground . All these right-wing nationalists were banned from other subs for speaking their views ... You can call me whatever you want , I will just be excited that no matter what is said there isnt some mod playing favorites on who gets silenced ...

Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ? "" Because they've learned to be guarded with guys lest their friendliness be mistaken for attraction . Or maybe this girl is just really open . Or maybe she actually just genuinely likes you as a human being ! You're not her emotional boyfriend ; she's your emotional girlfriend . You cutting her off might hurt her , but she'll survive and she'll date and otherwise get over it . For you , it will definitely hurt because you have the most to lose . That's why she's your emotional girlfriend . You're stuck in an awkward point in your dating timeline . It's going to suck getting through this , but you need to focus on things you can control . The only thing you can control here is you . Focus on yourself and getting as healthy as possible . Invest everything you have into yourself . Go to the gym , read self-help books , meet new people , find a therapist , pick up that hobby you've been putting off , go travel , have fun with your friends , learn how to be at ease with yourself , but stretch yourself as much as you can . You'll learn more about yourself , you'll learn how much you're capable of , and you'll learn what you like and what you're good at and what sort of people you don't like .

They tried to increase the performance of the poor and found that their efforts had results when the children were young , but by the time they got into high school the program had zero long term impact . This is due to gene expression increasing with age . do people succeed and their offspring succeed regardless of race if they're given a strong start Entirely incorrect . Not only does the head start program entirely refute this notion , but there is a mountain of evidence weighing against this . I'll show you where you can start your studies .

It wasn't even a fucking convo , she wasn't even online and didn't respond to the question I wrote her for <NUMBER> hours anyway . The question was if she talked to my gf at that time today .

Fucking fatty hates his mother too and doesn't like when they do things at his family's house , even though they literally go to her parents house EVERY DAY .

She literally would text him every minute , EVERY FUCKING MINUTE , and if he didn't respond right away she would get mad at him . Made hanging out with him a massive pain in the ass . It gets even better , before she messaged him on POF for the first time , she messaged ME first . I told her no I don't like fat women , then she immediately messaged my friend after ( not knowing we were buds ) . I'm sure she's held contempt for me because of that since day <NUMBER> .

Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it .

I have no grounds to suppose she is just on account of my having experienced self-consciousness before . If it's imagined , the whole business of why she , and other black women , feel this way is not immediately clear to us ; we do not come any closer to explaining why , exactly , a particular group of people feel under observation . I doubt there is any research confirming the collective paranoia of black women , and think it's reasonable to assume their experience of being a black person in a white community is something not well understood by white people ( reasonably ! ) . What I can gather from my own experience is that when I've been the only white person in a room full of black people , they definitely all look ; they all attempt discretion and likely mean to impose no discomfort for me , but I notice it . Still further , I work in a community based setting , with lots of white people who are well-meaning and strive for anti-racist approaches . When a black person walks into a room of white people , people do take notice . It's not as if everyone is staring in unison ; you're not going to hear a needle come off the record because of the shock of seeing someone who looks different from them , but people do glance . I do too ; there is a kind of curiosity everyone has about matters of difference . I don't think that it's meant to be ill-intentioned , or even make someone uncomfortable . I don't think it means the person doing the looking is awful or anything like that . It's a simple observation about some experiential differences between being black and being white .

There are many embassies are in the area . Belgravia is generally quiet and is a great area to walk around and admire the Georgian houses . There are also a number of exclusive shops , restaurants and attractive pubs . Bloomsbury Bloomsbury is London's literary district . This district , a world within itself , is bound roughly by Euston Road to the north , Gower Street to the west , and Clerkenwell to the east . It is , among other things , the academic heart of London . Camden Shoppers and people-watchers flock from far away to crowd the streets and chill out at Camden Market . Good cafes and clubs make Camden much more than a great market area . Canary Wharf , on the Isle of Dogs , is the heart of Docklands . This <NUMBER> - hectare ( <NUMBER> - acre ) site is dominated by a 240m - high ( <NUMBER> - ft . ) tower , which is the tallest building in the United Kingdom , and was designed by César Pelli . The Piazza of the tower is lined with shops and restaurants . Chelsea Once a center of innovation in the 19th century when the area was a veritable Victorian artists ' colony , the Beatles and the Rolling Stones lived in the neighborhood that has since lost in youth culture and settled into a small town atmosphere in the midst of the huge city . Chelsea is famous for the King's Road for the bohemian sixties and punks in the 1970s . It's a wealthy area like Kensinon and Knightsbridge . City of London ( The Square Mile ) The first settlement of Roman conquerors , The City is now the soul of the world's financial markets . Modern structures like the Lloyd's Building may outnumber ancient buildings such as the Bank of England and the Old Bailey but The City also holds the sacred St . Paul's Cathedral , Old Spitalfields Market , and Leadenhall Market and the modern Museum of London and Barbican Centre . Clerkenwell This neighborhood , north and a bit west of the City , was the site of London's first hospital and is the home of several early churches . St . Bartholomew-the-Great , built in <NUMBER> , still stands as London's oldest church and the best example of large-scale Norman building in the city . In the 18th century , Clerkenwell declined into a muck-filled cattle yard , home to cheap gin distilleries . During a 19th - century revival , John Stuart Mill's London Patriotic Club moved here in <NUMBER> , and William Morris's socialist press called Clerkenwell home in the 1890s - - Lenin worked here editing Iskra . The neighborhood again fell into disrepair but has recently been reinvented by the moneyed and groovy . A handful of hot restaurants and clubs have sprung up , and art galleries line St . John's Square and the border of Clerkenwell Green . Lest you think the whole area has become trendy , know that trucks still rumble into Smithfield Market throughout the night , unloading thousands of beef carcasses . Covent Garden Covent Garden's Piazza has daily open-air entertainment .

The East End Traditionally , this was one of London's poorest districts , nearly bombed out of existence during World War II . The East End extends east from the City Walls , encompassing Stepney , Bow , Poplar , West Ham , Canning Town , and other districts . These days , many immigrants to London make their homes in the East End . London is pushing eastward .

Holborn The old borough of Holborn ( Ho-burn ) , which abuts the City southeast of Bloomsbury , encompasses the heart of legal London - - this is where you'll find the city's barristers , solicitors , and law clerks . Islinon This corner of North London has ' Upper Street ' - a long road of boutique stores and numerous restaurants and bars . There's also Camden Passage antique shops near Angel tube .

There are still enough attractions to support a good selection of hotels , pubs , B & Bs , cafes , and restaurants . South Kensinon has the ' Big Three ' museums : V & A , Natural History Museum and the Science Museum . King's Cross Long a seedy area in the heart of London , King's Cross is facing a massive regeneration program . Millions of pounds are going into its decaying infrastructure . The area is still far from chic , but was given renewed importance with the arrival of Eurostar , the Channel Tunnel Rail Link coming into St . Pancras instead of Waterloo . Because of this change in venue , it's estimated that some <NUMBER> million passengers will pass through King's Cross annually . Six tubes now convene underneath King's Cross Station , and it is the number-one connection hub enabling visitors to get to and from Gatwick and Heathrow airports . Knightsbridge One of the priciest and most exclusive areas in London known for upscale shops and restaurants .

It's a great place to visit , but you probably won't want to stay here South Bank Just across from Westminster , don't miss the London Eye ( a gigantic wheel offering unrivaled views of the city ) and the newly-refurbished Royal Festival Hall which is part of the South Bank Centre . See the skateboarders under the Royal Festival Hall and visit the South Bank Book Market under Waterloo Bridge . Loads of free entertainment every summer : music , theater and performances . Southwark Shakespeare still appears at the famous Globe Theatre while Tate Modern boasts a shining cultural program . Stroll the riverside to Lambeth Palace , the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury or pay homage to cricket at the Oval . Westminster The British Empire , and once the world , was ruled from Whitehall . Royalty , government , and monumental London come together in the shadows of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament . Walk near the Kings and Queens buried in Westminster Abbey and take your own quiet stroll through St . James's Park and Green Park . Westminster also encompasses Victoria , an area that takes its name from bustling Victoria Station , "" the gateway to the Continent . "" Many B & Bs and hotels have sprouted up here because of the neighborhood's proximity to the rail station . Victoria is cheap and convenient if you don't mind the noise and crowds . Welfare recipients occupy many hotels along Belgrave Road . If you've arrived without a hotel reservation , you'll find the pickings better on the streets off Belgrave Road ."	NOT

It's actually important for our survival to know what the REAL limits are . As such people will test them out , often through edgy humor , to see where the actual push back is , where the real taboo begins . And when all you have is the knobheads and prudes with no life experience calling you out for it , well then you are just being cool and edgy and that taboo doesn't really exist . You can say nigger and make fun of Jews and you aren't really being a nazi or racist , and anyone who thinks you are probably doesn't know how to take themselves less seriously . It seems to me that this is exactly what is happening . The morality bandwagon is pretty strong but the taboo testing bandwagon really takes off in that sort of condition . The taboo testing bandwagon really needs a strong force to oppose it and really say its wrong , and in the USSR that was the KGB etc , for the nazis that was the Gestapo , and time and time again it has been proven that that doesn't work . So they need social consent . Of all people , Noam Chomsky covers this quite well . But he is ultimately a leftist shilling for Hillary . He offers liberals a couple of red pills and mixes blue pills in with them , but he really nails how they manufacture the consent of the populace to do things . Now just insert certain "" groups "" into the picture and cultural Marxism , and you get an idea of what could be going on .

Email a few different psychiatrists and ask about their procedures for Adult ADHD . Explain that you feel like you're not being listened to , and everything that happened with that other psychiatrist . Odds are , you'll get an answer from everyone , but there'll be one or two standouts--one or two that email you in detail , and talk about how they look at more than test results . These will likely be the ones that will give enough shits to listen to you .	NOT

15139	AskReddit	Posted this in a different thread , but it fits better here , so brace yourself : Boyfriend and I had been together for a mere week or so . Smitten , we decided to take a romantic bubble bath together . Cut to bubble bath , we've got the swanky background music and softly flickering candles going . We're kissing and things begin to heat up , he decides to turn on the jets . We continue our sexytime for a few moments before he looks down and emits a strangled cry of horror and scrambles to escape from the tub . Hundreds of dead cockroaches / cockroach body parts are swirling around us . When we got out there were antenna , legs , wings and other bits of roach bodies plastered all over our naked bodies . Turns out the tub was in the guest bathroom and hadn't been used in a couple of years and a colony of roaches had taken up in the pipes of the jets , their bodies gradually building up over time before being flushed directly into the midst of our would-be romantic bath time moment . Let's just say that neither of us were in the mood after that .	NOT

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage .

Also , to say that the limp-wristed , flamboyant gay guy doesn't exist is ridiculous . There are definitely gay guys who fall in line with that stereotype . A lot of stereotypes exist because there is truth in them . You also , I think , misunderstand exactly why atheists are so hated . The common person on the street has most likely not heard of Dawkins or Hitchens . Bill Maher and Penn Jillette are entertainers , so I'm sure more people have heard of them , but they don't really think of atheism first when they think of them . Bill Maher is a comedian . Penn Jillette is an illusionist . People hate and distrust atheists because many times , they feel that their religious background gives them some kind of monopoly on ethics and morality . They think atheists can't care about something bigger than themselves ( which is wrong , we can , it just happens not to be a god ) , and therefore don't have any reason to have moral or ethical concerns .

I was <NUMBER> years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend .

15734	politics	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : <URL> Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

"" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

I also think it's completely sensible to say that a demographic which is involved in more violent crime will have more police interaction and therefore more deaths by police . Having said that though , do you really think that after Rodney King , Walter Scott , Philando Castile , Eric Garner , and countless others , there's no argument that police violence against blacks is disproportionate , even considering the increased crime rates ?

Anyways one of the things you could do was "" eat the chicken salad sandwiches in the fridge "" , since there was no other food available , you weren't sure how long you'd be trapped in the building , and the power was out . I was arguing with my classmates that that was a high priority thing to do , that you didn't want to eat some mayo that had been sitting unrefrigerated for a few hours . Especially when you were trapped in a building with no running water in the toilets . They thought I was crazy , but it turned out I was right . We watched a video and the disaster survival team said eating unrefrigerated mayonnaise was a bad idea since it could easily lead to food poisoning .

16517	milliondollarextreme	"Sam Hyde's early days : his struggle to find a place in the world , and release through comedy Sam Hyde is more than a man , he is the hallmark of the modern western male raised on estrogen infused chicken and broken human relationships . The reason he has drawn such a following is his embodiment of all of us . We all share traits with Sam , and this is what drew us and him to the 4chan culture . Sam does what most of us don't have the courage to do , allowing his real and virtual world to combine in the form of MDE . Sam was born on April <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and from the very moment he first gasped air , his raison d'être has been comedy . His mother always laughed at toddler Sam's mischiefs around the house . This ultimately affected his life path ; Sam was raised into a predefined image stemming from his youthful and innocent vigor . This impacted him greatly , and his sole method of gaining the trust and friendship of others became humor . Sam does not remember his youth fondly , experiencing the divorce of his parents as well as a troubled school life , and would often miss classes or just not pay attention , preferring simply to make his classmates laugh . During his schooling , Sam perfected his ability to play the role of "" class clown , "" though we can see in retrospect that perhaps this facade arose as a defense against the bullying and alienation he experienced in elementary , which might be due to the lack of a father figure . Sam is like most of us in this respect , an ' outsider ' , but did not drop his guise after it successfully got him through highschool with only minor hiccups . Taking on a 40k USD Film major at RISD , and pursuing further study at Carnegie Mellon , Sam still saw a need to protect himself through a constant miasma of insincerity , and this is when the Million Dollar Extreme alter-ego truly came into form . Starting out with film projects for his major , Sam honed his obscure form of humor further , before creating the MDE Youtube channel on Dec 30th , <NUMBER> , around the time he finished his postgraduate studies at Carnegie . Sam was living in Pawtucket at this point ; not exactly an upper class neighborhood . It would be no understatement to say that Sam's tertiary studies had an impact on the family finances , despite Sam pitching in as much as he could , working as a car salesman with Nick . Sam was not able to find a job with his qualifications despite classmates getting placements at production studios like Nickelodeon , and so his student debt became a looming and increasingly troubling figure over his head . Sam's relationship with his mother was strained at this point , and he became upset with his lot in life . Sam took up weightlifting to relieve the stress he was constantly under , as he could not meet the expectations his college life had set him up for . From <NUMBER> onward , Sam devoted most of his free time to MDE ( doing freelance graphic design on the side ) with the help of now laid-off Rochefort , who brought childhood friend Charles into the MDE group . This was the era of the vertical video ; starting in <NUMBER> at MDE's true inception and effectively ending with the publication of "" College Cunts "" on June the 19th , <NUMBER> . These vertical videos reflect a disillusionment with the world around him , and Sam would post these videos on 4chan and 4chon , ignoring any negative feedback he received . It is interesting to note that Sam had a skin affliction of some sort at this time , and it may have contributed to his depression ; his only girlfriend left him in <NUMBER> , later joining the Occupy Wallstreet movement before becoming a realtor . Sam , Nick and Charles would hold frequent creative meetings , trying to think up content which would help them break through to a larger audience – efforts such as Tissuebox , despite good work from the team , failed to receive much traction . However , with the efforts of Sam and Nick in Mid <NUMBER> ( Charles was busy recording multiple audiobooks at this time ) , after long creative discussions into the early hours of the morning in a Providence apartment , MDE drifted away from their roots in vertical videos , moving onto more mainstream works such as "" Ideas Man "" , and even releasing a comedy album ( "" TWAT "" ) . From then onward , it was only a matter of time . Sam's videos were now being viraled on 4chan , Reddit and Facebook not only by him , but by his new fans who enjoyed a mixture of amateur , Sam-only phone videos , and the exercises of Sam's technical skill he had paid the world for , starring the trio we know today . Sam's fanbase continued to grow , and he fostered his internet presence with a new drive , marketing himself first via mde.tv , which he launched in <NUMBER> , and then finally founding the MDE subreddit on December 15th , <NUMBER> , all the while releasing more and more content for his fans to enjoy and spread around . Finally , after the Kickstarter TV full series was funded on Indiegogo , and many costly metallic T-shirts were shipped around the globe , MDE landed an Adult Swim slot in <NUMBER> , secured through old friends from Carnegie . The show "" World Peace "" , named by fans , is now in the works , and things are looking up for Sam Hyde , as well as Million Dollar Extreme as a whole ."	EXP

16537	Music	I remember always liking Jimi Hendrix , and alwasy hearing he was the best , a super psychadelic monster that was invincible , and I believed it to some degree , but I guess I had just never totally understood the utter reverence that so many people had for him . One day , I met up with some friends at the beach who were all tripping , and one of them casually asks if I want to as well . It was a beautiful sunny day on the San Juans in Washinon , on a rocky coast with seals dipping in and out , and starfish everywhere . I decided to do it . Well , after spending some time with them , the sun started to go down , and they all began to head on , but I realized my trip was just beginning . I made my way home alone , decided to play some music as the trip took hold and thus began my moment with Jimi . I made my way slowly into my friend's room , which was still somewhat dark . I could hear things crawling and creaking on my peripherals , my vision swam with color and things gently breathed all around me . I sat down the couch and saw my roomie's guitar hooked up to the amp . I grabbed it , and in so doing touched his computer which had been left on . Immediately , a Jimi Hendrix playlist that he had been jamming along with began to play , the guitar already set in tune , with perfect crunch . I looked up , and lo and behold the moonlight had begun streaming through a window covered by a cloth wall hanging of Jimi hendrix himself . His lines , his rhythms , his playing suddenly all made totaly sense to me . He weaves this incredible psychadelic pattern that is amazing colorful and delicate . You can hear two or even three gutair parts weaving in and out of his playing effortlessly while he plays . It drives itself directly to your core , and explodes with joy and light . I don't know how long I was there playing with Jimi , but I'll never forget it , it really opened my eyes to what Psychadelic music really was , and the power music can have over a person who has a gift like that . Luckily , there are MANY wonderful musicians with that gift .	NOT

16576	atheism	I have no evidence to support that hypothesis , so at this point I must conclude that no , I am not . To support my previous statement however , we are able to measure gravity with tremendous precision , and it varies depending on where you stand on Earth due to your physical proximity to core . Similarly , gravity is weaker on the moon than it is on Earth , and the moon's gravity also affects Earth's rotation . Meanwhile , there is also the other planets of the solar system and of course the Sun itself , not to mention the contents of the milky way galaxy . Even a planetoid's gravity is not constant , as it accrues or loses mass its gravity consequently alters . Therefore , I conclude that gravity itself is subjective and not immutable .

16600	milliondollarextreme	as sam once said : Just speaking for myself ( Sam ) - - I'll always have anarchic / outsider sympathies / tendencies but ... the SJW stuff and the diversity stuff have gone too far , past the point of no return . And I'm a super tolerant guy , I'm perfectly happy to have people screaming in my face and insulting me if that's what it takes to have prosperity and a stable and fair society . But if you read enough of this shit you realize that's not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white / masculine / traditional totally eliminated or suppressed . A year or two back , I might've said the most important issues were ... surveillance , ending the war on drugs , campaign finance reform , military adventurism--something like that . But I've grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap , and I'm tired of people telling me that I've got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise . Gamergate was eye-opening , BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening , but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham ... Europe is in a dire situation : culture is being destroyed , some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps , and a lot of these places might not ever be the same . I don't think that's a good thing , or a healthy thing , to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are <NUMBER> - 20x more likely to rape . I'm sorry I just don't think that's good , I know it's insensitive as hell , but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently . This is just the way it is , Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here . It's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate . Send them money , let them use the technology we invented , give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty , quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good , but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive , inventive , civilized , free countries and dumping them into the incinerator . Of course we have problems , of course the NSA is bad , of course it would be nice if we could all have $ <NUMBER> an hour for whatever , but would you rather live here , or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia ? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays , Chinese , or Saudis ? Whether you think the problem is genetic or cultural , it doesn't matter when you import immigrants in large numbers , because they form communities that don't integrate . They bring their language and their religion with them , and they vote for socialist policies . This will continue until white people have been sucked dry , and then there won't be any voting anymore , there'll be Sharia law instead . We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us . We didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit , our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard , not to flush down the toilet . You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical , your ancestors did , so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you . These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side . Comedy shouldn't be ' political ' ... Sensitive WASPy types don't like when things get publicly political . Sam Hyde is funny I just wish he wouldn't be ' political ' ... First of all , nobody even BATS A FUCKING EYE when Zach Galifianakis or Jim Carrey dips into some political issue that they know nothing about ( because their views fall safely in the bubble of insanity that is societally accepted as ' OK ' ) . Secondly ... THIS ISN'T EVEN POLITICAL The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue , it's a historical issue , as in we are toying with the fruits of <NUMBER> years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes . I don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time . I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad . I voted for Gary Johnson in <NUMBER> . If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea , or that weed should remain illegal , or think whatever about gay marriage , I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible . Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls , whatever , I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes . But this isn't about politics , it's about having an identity and a home and not losing these beautiful civilizations that took so long to create . The future is headed towards Cormac McCarthy's The Road and talking / thinking about it gives you an uh-oh boo-boo feeling in your tummy because someone might call you waycis ? A lot of people have been hitting me up recently to ask about this , and everybody comes to the same conclusion , they agree and can see what's happening , but addressing it head-on gives them a no-no feeling , like a bad . They feel a bad , and they worry that people will think they're bad racers , shame no-no . This doesn't mean you have to start hating black people or using racial slurs or deliberately making yourself unpopular at parties , but whites need to regain some sort of cohesive tribal self-interest and identity right now just like everybody else has or in fifty years this country is going to be like Brazil ( the bad parts , not the sexy babes and beaches and rich dudes in white linen suits ) . It's possible to have compassion for Third-Worlders , goodwill towards all mankind , respectful conversations with and attitudes towards people who don't look like you , and at the same time not want your own country to become a cesspit :) Sorry for getting all ' political ' , I'll go make some funny faces now	EXP

Where agnostic really falls in is on the nature of God , what God's true will is , what Christ's true teachings were and if they were corrupted in translation , is the organised church good ? All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang . Not to mention the model of abiogenesis has to account for starting evolution , ie the first organism would have to be capable of reproducing and evolving . edit : grammar"	NOT

In regards to what you're saying I completely understand , and I feel like it fits the characteristics of a gluttonous bugbear to misinterpret something , rework it in their head in a way that suits them the best , and then gorge themselves on it . Instead of taking the idea that the relationship between a dom and sub is equal ( they both work to satisfy one another ) , they remove the effort from their end and place it entirely on the sub , expecting that their mere presence is good enough . I'm sure there are instances where that is the kind of relationship two people want , but it isn't every case , and definitely a lot less likely when an obeast is involved . I have long thought about getting involved in kink scene and giving it a try , but looking online and seeing what I'd have in store for me I think I'd rather just leave it be . I've seen too much .

17148	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

However , while there is the testing of certain cognitive abilities , some of the stuff like mathematics and language skills are fairly relative to your previous knowledge .

17570	OperationPullRyan	Statement by the President on H . R . <NUMBER> : Today I have signed into law H . R . <NUMBER> , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <NUMBER> . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over <NUMBER> pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section <NUMBER> affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> U . S . C . <NUMBER> note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the <NUMBER> AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section <NUMBER> confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section <NUMBER> ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section <NUMBER> ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the <NUMBER> AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section <NUMBER> seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section <NUMBER> is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section <NUMBER> provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section <NUMBER> provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past <NUMBER> years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

He's not your buddy , he isn't on our side , start looking at him as the man with more power than anyone else in the world , and realize if he wants to , which he does since he requested the provisions , he could detain you for life due to whatever he sees fit as a reason .

Regardless of what you think about this issue , regardless of whether you normally research things before you opine on them , this is the time to do it . BIG EDIT : I've never had more posts to reply to than I have the time to , and honestly , I'm impressed , a lot of you know your history . Granted , a lot of you are treating this like a game of football . What matters isn't what is right or wrong , you and I , regardless of where in the world we are , are now in a struggle against worldwide tyranny , or far worse , the full on destruction of our only planet . You need to be aware that there is a lot of uncertainty to all of this . We aren't sure what any of these people are planning , just that their methods to reach their plans have moved away from the common interest of all humans . I do not know what will happen , as I've never witnessed tyranny first hand , all I know is that if we do nothing , we can assume the worst will happen . But , if we act now , and protest , and let those we interact with know how we feel on this issue , and debate , and discuss , and improve our thoughts , as we have been on reddit , we have a chance of turning the tide . The closest way to that solution I see now is what Occupy is , it's what the hippie movement was , it's a movement for human actualization , let's try to not fuck it up this time with the drugs and anti-establishment message , and make this a message all humans want to be a part of . This is more important than all of that . We need a new constitution that reflects our greater understanding of humanity , as the founders gathered to develop years ago .	NOT

17711	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT

17984	holocaust	What is anti-semitic here ? Jews are no people of the Almighty God , they are an abomination of this world . Their blood is not clean , their souls are not clean . They are a mixture of Negros , Asians , and Muslims . Jews have no home and Israel is not their home , Jews are wanderers of this world like Satan is , kicked out of Heaven to wander the Earth seeking who should he devour . Jews are like that , normal people connect with their land , with their blood , with their race , their nation . A Jew cannot do this because he has none of the above , he is an eternal wanderer of this world . In his jealousy of the others , he ( Jew ) wants to destroy a once normal society built by our ancestors , a Jew wants to create chaos and hatred among nations to disguise their master plan to conquer the world and control all the investments banks and media ( which they do control and had been in a control ) , they squeeze the system and manipulate it to their own benefits . They push their own people into Hollywood and top paid jobs . We are slaves to the money [ CAPITALISM ] which was created by them . When Germany was economically destroyed in the 1920s - early 1930s the Jews were doing fine in Germany . Doing the only thing they can : buying and selling . Because a Jew cannot do a proper job , because he doesn't wanna benefit the nation in which he is , he wants to devour it . Because a Jew doesn't have a nation . Only tricks to manipulate the society and make it more degenerate until it is completely destroyed without people noticing this . A Jew is the ETERNAL ENEMY of the world .	EXP

17989	magicTCG	Did a lot of those people who complained play netdecks ? That is often an issue . When I make my own decks , I get irritated losing to netdeck players . Netdeck players also get REALLY upset if I beat them with something that I obviously made up , as they feel , I tihnk , that they spent more time researching and learning the best decks and if they lose to ' jank ' , then it was just luck . Conversely , if I lose to someone who also made their own deck ... I am happy to lose , or at least , as happy as I will ever be losing . On cockatrice I chat away with people who make their own decks , and congratulate them when they win . Vs net deck players I often rage quit . :/	NOT

17992	politics	Which is exactly why he should've veto'ed it . Either he's too arrogant and thinks he will win again , or he's simply irresponsible to leave such power in the hands of future presidents , especially if anyone besides Ron Paul from the Republican party gets the presidency .	NOT
17993	Korean	I've been using Integrated Korean for the last <NUMBER> months and I think it's great . The Beginner books are very new ( <NUMBER> I think ) , but the later books were written around <NUMBER> I believe . So far I've gotten to Intermediate <NUMBER> and it's helped me a lot . I would say that they're best with other materials like TTMIK though , as otherwise you end up with a lot of grammar but no vocabulary or speaking ability .
