"" Rights for gays , oh yeah "" repeated over and over again doesn't seem particularly high brow . Seems lifeless , juvenile , almost uncaring . I think the verse that really needs to be paid attention to is the one where he starts talking about free healthcare for all . I think it's a satire of how the left reduces gay people , real humans with real human issues and concerns , to a mere political talking point . A voter base that can be springboarded off of to push whatever the fashionable liberal cause of the day is , in this instance free healthcare . The left doesn't actually care about gay people anymore than they care about pandering to any other liberal political issue for votes and virtue signaling . Gay people are reduced to a number , an issue to be resolved . Anyway , that's my two cents . Maybe I'm reading too deeply into it but that's what I got out of it ."	EXP

123	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

192	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

227	europeannationalism	Juncker vows to use new powers to block the far-right The EU will isolate and use sanctions against any far-right or populist governments that are swept to power or presidential office on the wave of popular anger against migration . Jean-Claude Juncker , president of the European Commission , made clear at the weekend that Norbert Hofer would have been frozen out of EU decision-making if he had been elected president of Austria . “ There is no debate or dialogue with the far-right , ” Mr Juncker said . Under powers given to the commission in <NUMBER> , he can trigger a “ rule of law mechanism ” for countries that depart from democratic norms by putting a government under constitutional supervision . Ultimately , a country can be stripped of voting rights in the EU or have funding blocked . In a test run for the new EU constitutional powers , the commission has issued unprecedented orders to Poland , instructing the newly elected right-wing government to bow to Polish judges who have struck down laws passed by the parliament . Mr Hofer had alarmed the EU by threatening to politicise the office of Austrian president by wielding powers , never used before , to trigger national elections at a moment most favourable for the far-right Freedom party ( FPO ) . “ You ’ ll be surprised at all the things that are possible , ” he said before the vote . Though he lost narrowly , Austria witnessed the biggest far-right surge in Europe since the Second World War . The FPO is the largest party after the collapse of the Social Democrats ( SPO ) and People ’ s party ( OVP ) , the centre-right and centre-left parties that have ruled Austria between them since <NUMBER> . Mr Hofer repeatedly threatened to use presidential powers to dissolve the current SPO-OVP coalition government , which is racked by turmoil . He said in a newspaper interview in March that , as president , he would dismiss the government if it did not stop the influx of refugees , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> of whom reached Austria last year , and if it failed to alter its economic policies . Mr Hofer carries an Austrian-made Glock 9mm pistol because , he explains , of “ uncertainty ” caused by Muslim immigration . The FPO deputy leader is regarded as more moderate than Heinz-Christian Strache , the party ’ s firebrand figurehead , but his views are every bit as radical . In beer hall speeches he has railed about the “ invasion of the Muslims ” . Mr Hofer has warned that not all the refugees who have come to Austria are friendly and that some “ are prepared to cut off another person ’ s head ” . The EU faces the rise of other far-right parties , including the National Front in France and Geert Wilders ’ s Freedom party in the Netherlands . The deadline passed yesterday for Poland to back down in the government ’ s confrontation with the constitutional court . In January Frans Timmermans , the European Commission ’ s “ first vice-president ” in charge of humans rights , announced that he was triggering , for the first time , the EU ’ s “ rule of law mechanism ” over Poland . Talks have remained deadlocked since then as Beata Szydlo , the Polish prime minister whose Law and Justice party is affiliated to the British Tories , has grown increasingly enraged at lectures from Brussels . The row began when President Duda of Poland , who is allied to the Law and Justice party , refused to swear in three constitutional court judges . Then , in March , the constitutional court struck down a law rushed through parliament restricting the powers of the judiciary over the Polish government . The government ignored the ruling , provoking street protests and condemnation in Brussels , with the looming threat of an explicit EU diktat to Poland instructing the country ’ s parliament to back down . Hungary , which has also been criticised by the commission over constitutional questions , has pledged to fight alongside Poland to defend parliamentary sovereignty . The EU ’ s determination to head off and to keep in check far-right and populist governments could backfire . Witold Waszczykowski , the Polish foreign minister , said that the new powers went beyond the terms of the EU that his country joined in <NUMBER> . “ This is not the union , not the kind of membership that we have agreed to , ” he said .

249	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

259	uncensorednews	"Ah yes , this comment reeks of bigotry . So I'm just going to get out in front on this one . Here is my retort to this bull-shit argument as a middle class well-behaved white person . If you found a video of that occurring you would more than likely be pulling from one of like two sources . first would be in europe , and fuck europe , those people are all drunks , and europe has no bearing on american racial politics . First , way to judge <NUMBER> million people . Once again , you judge a whole group of people based on the actions of a few . second would be a trailer park in alabama , now , you kind of have a point , but the main difference is we ridicule these people viciously ourselves , and knowingly try to avoid that . Way to only judge the south . There are white people all across the country that stir up problems from all levels of income and walks of life , but this is really besides the main point . you black folks don't do that , we never see BLM people out calling out some black trash for dealing dope in the hood , and stealing all day long , we white people have daily battles in pop culture with how shitty white people are , in the news , on the radio on the way to work , we deal with it daily . Way to assume my race . I'm white and the funny thing is I never feel like I'm being targeted for my race because I don't live in a false reality . I don't know where you are getting these ideas . Answer me this , have you ever been victimized in person , not online , for being white ? Second , have you ever treated someone different in person because of their skin color ? Chances are the first has never happened and you are probably guilty of the second . Next , since apparently it is so widely discussed in the media that white people are the worst , can you give me just one reference form the past week from the mainstream news or media that backs up this claim ? I doubt you can . we never hear steve harvey on the radio telling on some black guy for talking shit about another race , steve harvey himself is in the news for being racist against asian men ... What is with this idea that if someone is black and a celebrity it is their job to bring upon themselves to try to fix racism in this country ? What an asinine argument . Second , Steve Harvey rightfully received backlash for his comments . Third , no one is saying black people cannot be racist . And the people that do are racist themselves . So what is your point ? But nobody gives a fuck , its not on the front page , why ? Oh but people do . These types of posts do make it on the front page . Remember what happened in Chicago a few weeks back ? They made the front page for like two or three days straight . Also , right wing media definitely cares . Oh they get off on this stuff because their viewers love to hate on topics like this and get riled up anytime they feel even the tiniest bit of unfairness , just like you are doing in this thread . I swear , right wing sites ran BLM smear articles every week of <NUMBER> , even when nothing had happened involving that group . Anytime someone that is black says something stupid or anything remotely in the realm of racist , oh they are there to talk trash about them , misrepresent a peaceful , awareness movement ( that has admittedly had a small portion of people stir up trouble and misrepresent them ) , condemn a whole race , and generally beat a dead horse . The first thing you wanna scream about is how "" You can't judge us all . "" why can't we judge any of you ? You should judge someone by the content of their character . It is that simple . So what is someone is black and from south Chicago ? That does not mean he's guilty and involved with the crime statistics of the area . If we start treating people like this , then that means I can label you for the worst of the people you can be associated with . Funny how this is lost on so many people like yourself . For people like you , it's all okay to racially profile someone until it gets turned around back on you . Are you from a rural area ? Must be stupid and married to your cousin . Are you white ? You must be racist . Female from the coast ? SJW feminist . Black ? Thug . Male from the center of the country ? Redneck . Hispanic ? Illegal that doesn't pay taxes . There are million different ways we can assume the worst of people . The irony is you are so fussy about this perceived hate and judgment towards white people , but yet you argue that should be able to judge others . You are such a hypocrite . But you see , this double standard is why you are a bigot . the second a white cop stops a black person for something its immediately racism , and not the fact you are wearing the uniform of a gangster . No it isn't . No one is saying this . If you look like a gangster and are only stopped because how you are dressed , that is racial profiling . You'd be pissed if the same happened to you . Oh by the way , do you remember the guy that got stopped for a broken taillight , told the officer he had a concealed weapons permit and the gun in the car so not to alarm the cop , and the cop still shot him when he was pulling out his car insurance information , all the while his wife and baby were in the car watching ? What do you say about that ? You assume the worst of blacks . You really do . The strenh of your argument is based on how poorly you look down on them , which is why you are blind to the good the people in the black communities do and stand for . You are also so blind to the failures of the white communities , unless it's Europe I guess ... There are good and bad people in both groups . However , you only see what you want to because it helps justify your narrow-minded viewpoint . The point im trying to make is nobody in the black community takes responsibility for anything . Takes a responsibility for what ? And yes they do . If you look for it you see it all the time . Here are some stats for you though , not that it will do you any good . You perceive black communities as this crime ridden filth that takes no responsibility for its actions , however apparently whites are such a beacon of accountability . What you don't notice is that the crime you focus on is product of poverty , not race . When you compare race and the same levels of income , crime is virtually the same . That means the same percentage of low-income whites are involved in the same percentage of crime as low-income blacks . However , when being sentenced , blacks receive harsher punishments for the same crimes and number of offences than whites . What do you say to that data ? You should step out of your white-only world and start talking with minorities of all races about these issues . I think then you may have a better understanding of this whole situation . Sincerely , A knowingly privileged white that's tired of hearing the stupidity from out-of-touch whites about race relations and how they are now the "" most mistreated group "" in the U . S ."	EXP

Assigning a monetary value isn't necessary . Shunning a registrar based on their political positions is valid and a part of economics . Another example would be buying a product due to unaccounted negative externalities of other products , like buying organic produce because you believe it's bad to create dead zones due to fertilizer runoff from industrial agriculture .

531	milliondollarextreme	as sam once said : Just speaking for myself ( Sam ) - - I'll always have anarchic / outsider sympathies / tendencies but ... the SJW stuff and the diversity stuff have gone too far , past the point of no return . And I'm a super tolerant guy , I'm perfectly happy to have people screaming in my face and insulting me if that's what it takes to have prosperity and a stable and fair society . But if you read enough of this shit you realize that's not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white / masculine / traditional totally eliminated or suppressed . A year or two back , I might've said the most important issues were ... surveillance , ending the war on drugs , campaign finance reform , military adventurism--something like that . But I've grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap , and I'm tired of people telling me that I've got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise . Gamergate was eye-opening , BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening , but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham ... Europe is in a dire situation : culture is being destroyed , some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps , and a lot of these places might not ever be the same . I don't think that's a good thing , or a healthy thing , to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are <NUMBER> - 20x more likely to rape . I'm sorry I just don't think that's good , I know it's insensitive as hell , but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently . This is just the way it is , Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here . It's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate . Send them money , let them use the technology we invented , give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty , quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good , but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive , inventive , civilized , free countries and dumping them into the incinerator . Of course we have problems , of course the NSA is bad , of course it would be nice if we could all have $ <NUMBER> an hour for whatever , but would you rather live here , or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia ? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays , Chinese , or Saudis ? Whether you think the problem is genetic or cultural , it doesn't matter when you import immigrants in large numbers , because they form communities that don't integrate . They bring their language and their religion with them , and they vote for socialist policies . This will continue until white people have been sucked dry , and then there won't be any voting anymore , there'll be Sharia law instead . We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us . We didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit , our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard , not to flush down the toilet . You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical , your ancestors did , so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you . These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side . Comedy shouldn't be ' political ' ... Sensitive WASPy types don't like when things get publicly political . Sam Hyde is funny I just wish he wouldn't be ' political ' ... First of all , nobody even BATS A FUCKING EYE when Zach Galifianakis or Jim Carrey dips into some political issue that they know nothing about ( because their views fall safely in the bubble of insanity that is societally accepted as ' OK ' ) . Secondly ... THIS ISN'T EVEN POLITICAL The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue , it's a historical issue , as in we are toying with the fruits of <NUMBER> years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes . I don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time . I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad . I voted for Gary Johnson in <NUMBER> . If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea , or that weed should remain illegal , or think whatever about gay marriage , I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible . Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls , whatever , I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes . But this isn't about politics , it's about having an identity and a home and not losing these beautiful civilizations that took so long to create . The future is headed towards Cormac McCarthy's The Road and talking / thinking about it gives you an uh-oh boo-boo feeling in your tummy because someone might call you waycis ? A lot of people have been hitting me up recently to ask about this , and everybody comes to the same conclusion , they agree and can see what's happening , but addressing it head-on gives them a no-no feeling , like a bad . They feel a bad , and they worry that people will think they're bad racers , shame no-no . This doesn't mean you have to start hating black people or using racial slurs or deliberately making yourself unpopular at parties , but whites need to regain some sort of cohesive tribal self-interest and identity right now just like everybody else has or in fifty years this country is going to be like Brazil ( the bad parts , not the sexy babes and beaches and rich dudes in white linen suits ) . It's possible to have compassion for Third-Worlders , goodwill towards all mankind , respectful conversations with and attitudes towards people who don't look like you , and at the same time not want your own country to become a cesspit :) Sorry for getting all ' political ' , I'll go make some funny faces now	EXP

573	fatpeoplehate	"There is / was a whale pod at my gym . Fortunately I have figured out what time they all go so I can avoid them pretty easy . But for the first few weeks I was hitting up the gym with my SO when he would finish work ( he finishes much later than I do so we would go for evening weights about <NUMBER> - 8p m ) There is about <NUMBER> fatties who are doing one of the "" <NUMBER> WEEK BEST BIKINI BODY BOOTCAMP "" programs with one of the lady trainers . When I say trainers , its really weird at my gym , they don't have lots of "" employed "" trainers but I think trainers are allowed to design their own groups so long as they pay their own membership and people attending their group pay a $ <NUMBER> visit fee each time and / or possibly sign up for membership themselves . The bootcamps are an extra cost which participants pay directly to the trainer because they're not making an income off the gym owner . The lady trainer is BUFF , total beefcake babe who caught me mirin a few times . She actually approached me and asked about my weights routine and made a comment , something along the lines of "" Wish these girls would take on the weights but they don't want to get big "" with a flick of her sweet ponytail towards the fat fucks . This struck me as really odd , considering the trainers appearance was an obvious result of lifting heavy things , but when I thought about it later maybe she was actually being super sarcastic and was a super shitlord . I watched the whole bootcamp routine in the mirror as I was getting ready for my next set and realised that all the hams were fawning over the trainer and she was literally screaming in laughter at their comments . The next few times I saw this group I noticed some of the hams wearing knee or elbow braces , like those pull on ' tube sock without the toe ' looking sleeve things . After a few weeks the number of hams decreased or their "" injuries "" became so bad that they couldn't ( wouldn't ) do certain exercises . Keep in mind majority of the exercise was cardio based , row machine , bike , cross trainer etc . But nothing like plyometric ( jumping etc ) or anything that should be done specifically with a trainer unless you are a bit special in the head and / or need assistance with basic movement . By the 4th or 5th week the group was down to only <NUMBER> hams . She still had a super cheerful banter with the remaining two fatties and as my SO was going to leave ( I was off re-racking my weights like a good little pup ) SO over heard the trainer talking to some other hams out the front of the gym . They were saying something about signing up to another boot camp next month . When I jumped in the car my SO made a wise crack about me joining their bootcamp and "" making friends "" ( he knows I despise hams ) and I couldn't help but notice the trainer standing beside her car ... counting $ <NUMBER> bills . In Australia hundys are super recognisable , they're long and fucking bright green . It clicked . This trainer would put on these <NUMBER> week "" bootcamps "" and have people pay up front ( she had likely just signed up the two fat fucks at <NUMBER> sessions , for $ <NUMBER> per session for <NUMBER> weeks , additional FREE session to entice a sale ) She would know that the hams are in no way dedicated ( as I witnessed through their drop off rate ) so up front payment was fast and easy cash . She also probably knew she wouldn't have to put that much effort into making a routine for the boot camp and all she had to do was laugh at the all the fat fucks "" quirky "" jokes . She got her cash , gym go their cash / direct debit membership , hams fucked off after <NUMBER> weeks and a whole new set of hams rolled on in . Don't get me totally wrong , I will applaud anyone making efforts to better their lives providing they are committed to push through . But this is an exact behaviour of a fucking obeast . They think they can get the "" bikini body "" in <NUMBER> fucking weeks ( ONCE A WEEK SESSION FOR <NUMBER> MINUTES ) they have this beautiful trainer who is chatty and laughs at all their bullshit and doesn't "" judge "" the . Then they stop going , some wont even attend the full <NUMBER> sessions . Edit : Holy fuckballz this turned into a mega rant so obligatory : TLDR : Fat fucks think <NUMBER> forty minute sessions at the gym will leave them feeling lighter when in reality only their wallet will lose the weight"	EXP

The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

740	milliondollarextreme	""" admitting sexual assault "" ok if you believe Trump's claims in that instance , than you have to believe his other claims like his wealth and achievements . everyone knows he has a history of frequently lying and exaggerating , yet this one thing must be absolutely true ? Even if the emails were the only bad thing about Hillary there's enough stuff in them to get her convicted to multiple felonies . Of course there's far more than just her emails , like the hidden cam footage of her campaign admitting to rigging elections , for starters . Also remember that Hillary has been a politician probably since elementary school and has a lifetime of training and experience with how to present herself , and answer questions . Trump has always been the brash , aggressive business man type , even if he's only posturing . He doesn't have experience in politics and therefore doesn't automatically jump into robot politician mode whenever he talks . Of course Hillary's going to sound more "" presidential "" when she speaks - she's been groomed to do so for decades . She's given all the answers before hand and still has a hard time competing against a "" bumbling idiot . "" That's pathetic . That's like a NEET getting his ass kicked at Halo by a girl who hasn't played video games before . Oh yea and the "" dozens of assault victims "" that came forward , coincidently during election crunch time , aren't that believable when many have already recanted their statements , and one ( or more ) have admitted the DNC offered them money to make false claims that Trump sexually assaulted her . On top of that , other accusers have been paid by the DNC at some point . Don't forget that Anthony Weiner's wife has a high paying job on HC's campaign ... I don't want to address each point I was just pulling things out quickly from my head , but i'm sure most of what you wrote can be debated as well , if not simply proven false . I don't believe Trump is some angel whose never committed some type of crime or done shady shit , especially since he brags about doing shady shit , but to pretend like the things he's done is worse than HC is just stupid . oh yea and one more of your points that just came back to me : he was right to imply the judge might have a bias seeing as how a lot of Mexicans were really mad at Trump .

1226	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America .

In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

1241	uncensorednews	"You think the US government is trying to get the country to hate whites even though it is made up of mostly older white men that want to stay in power ? That makes no sense Turns out a lot of those are Jews . Also intra-white competition and conflict is very much a thing . Upper class liberal whites strongly dislike prole whites . I asked for a link not some statement that you could have easily pulled out of thin air I linked to Colin Flaherty above . He's pretty good or you might like [ Stuff Black People Don't Like ] ( <URL> Or just read the sort of studies that looks at crime and pay attention to what the definitions actually means . Clearly you don't know the definition of a hate crime , because a "" crime "" done in defense is not a hate crime . That's my point . White hate crimes are inflated due to self defense being counted as hate crimes . Here's [ an example ] ( <URL> There was a demonstration by whites driving cars flying the confederate flag . One car got an engine failure and was stranded outside a black party . The blacks got hostile and surrounded them and the man brandished a shotgun to get them to back off . The white couple got <NUMBER> years in prison for flying gang colors and terrorising people . This despite several police officers present who saw no need to intervene . the news also tries to make hate crimes against black kids acts of "" defense "" I honestly believe there's not been a single case of that happening in the US in the last <NUMBER> years . Feel free to link to a case where you believe that happened . Your claim that the people that Dylan Roof murdered defended black murderers is an ignorant and blind assumption so I'm not even going to argue with that . Ok . Why do you think it's taboo in the black community to talk with the police ? Or why there's always black people to speak up for black criminals claiming they did nothing wrong and were just about to go back to college and get their life together ? Nobody did that for Dylann Roof . "" The primary cause of black suffering is black dysfunction "" again , wildly ignorant assumption so I'm not even going to bother . The person with the most influence over your life is you . If things go badly for you it is very likely to be hugely influenced by your decisions . If you look at black behavior they hugely make poor decisions like eating bad food , not saving , not studying , getting kids early , not getting married , taking drugs , commiting stupid crimes and so on . That's mainly due to their decisions . If whites have any influence over them they're very much trying to get them to act in the opposite direction . Of course you don't want to see white people tortured , but from your arguments it sounds like you want to see your racism be justified so you want to see cases where blacks act like the "" monkeys "" you think they are Other way around . Being racist means you're a pariah and never can state your views openly . I very much want not to be racist and spent a few years rationalizing away the evidence until I couldn't . and you don't want your squeaky clean view of white people to be tainted so you only want to see them as the great innocent people they are if not the victims . I think whites are a fundamentally broken and degenerate people and it's highly uncertain whether we'll survive as anything but an insignificant minority . "" Pretty sure most blacks do get welfare ... "" hahahahahaha good argument , very convincing . Again that entire paragraph is a bunch of bs assumptions of an entirely thought up description for black people that you contrived in your head , because you are racist [ Here's a discussion on the subject ] ( <URL> You keep throwing out percentages and statistics but I see no links That's because they are my rough estimates , I'm not writing a scientific paper here and I'm certainly not spending hours googling stuff I've read at some point in the last <NUMBER> years for you not to read . I'm presenting my views in a rough quantifiable manner to make it clear what I believe , not in order to convince you . If you care about the subject , you put in the hours of research yourself . You must think of yourself and the white race sooo highly that you think that they are the sole reason that black people can survive , even though they are the sole reason why black people were enslaved and held back for many many years . Compare the blacks with enslaved ancestors to those without and tell me which population does best . Hint : not those in Africa . Also , look into Muslim African slave trade . As for the white race . Yes , we did great things and yes we were uniquely merciful to other races . It is a historical fact that the only reason slavery was abolished was that white people wanted it abolished . Every other people were fine with the institution and had no problem owning or killing other people . Whether that's a good thing remains to be seen . Currently our altruism and acceptance of non-whites is killing us and destroying our countries , so maybe it's just a weakness that will be weeded out of humanity . I'd ask for a link to support your claim about the kkk , but I know it's not going to show up . But here , I'll give you one <URL> The South was destroyed and occupied by Northerners who mercilessly exploited them and forced them into abject poverty you seriously don't see the morality of an occupied people standing up for themselves against their conquerors ?

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

1486	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

Generally the way these government backed stats are wrong is due to bullshit reasons to begin with . They aren't disproved . My saying the white people shooting up schools is to show that society doesn't grab their pitchforks and go out looking for white people after a school shooting . No but blacks will burn down their cities and assault whites if a criminal black man is killed by a white ( or hispanic ) officer . Hell , BLM already has white blood on their hand with the Dallas killings and no one talks about that shit anymore . On the same topic , when blacks shoot up some public place I don't see whites calling them out though this is generally because these shootings get very little national coverage . But if a black person shoots a white guy , all hell breaks loose and everybody on social media suddenly starts saying nigger every sentence , while claiming they're not racist . Firstly - I am a racist . I accept and embrace this . Secondly - The justified rage on social media is not equivalent to actual hate crimes against whites .

1597	uncensorednews	Islam is a whole system that lead to it becoming the only religion look at ME . If you want it explained then here it is a good place to start : <URL> Sorry , but a satirist / comidean on youtube is no real source of information . Similar as i do not quote John Oliver , simply because everything they use tends to be cut out of context for time and laughter , so you cannot know when it is in context and when not . They aren't an organization they are people that are living there . Just because they aren't part of any organization it doesn't mean that they aren't Islamist . Never said that . Talking about these Organisations because I wanted to differentiate them from normal muslims . Also , Islamist is basically meaning being part or affiliated to those organisations . everyone else is no worse than christian orthodox : They are focused on religion , but they won't blow you up because of it . Small ? You mean vast majority are Islamist . I don't care if they are radical or not , they views are incompatible with secular free society . Islamist is synonymous with radical . And the vast majority are muslim , not islamist . No it isn't since that would be a silly stereotype not something that is well researched , and factual . and calling Syrians / Irakis / Afgahns etc , all those refugees nationalities , ( mostly ) Islamic is not ? Calling them mostly muslim is already close to being a stereotype , given there are several other confessions there too . but already going in to calling them Islamist , and extending that to the refugees , is outright unjustified . Do those kids get more welfare ? You understand that they have no papers , and they just claim what they age is , right ? Yes , they might not have papers . But no , childs do not get more welfare in germany . They actually get less ( since they are assumed to have less expenses ) , and a lot of them travel alone , so they would actually have an interest to say they were older . I call that bs study . Sorry , i am no native speaker . Do you mean you want a source ? So not very useful to see how it works for muslim population . No , actually as useful as it gets . Like i said , it said that there were almost no variances between different origin countries . It is too general because it isn't only about muslims . As i said , the data was consistent throughout all different groups . I am saying that families that do pre-arranged marriage with females from Pakistan or Somalia can be in minority but steal become a significant % due to how many kids they have . Even if that were to work ( and there is much more factors to it than just this , like 2nd gens likelyhood to not marry another 2nd gen or a pre-arragned partner ... ) , it would take so many generations that we cannot predict how other groups will have changed up until that point . Again , i have to ask , where are you from ? UK ? US ? Germany ? I just want to understand your POV .	EXP

1608	fatpeoplehate	Feel free to PM me about non-subreddit related questions . There's already a bit of a backlash on certian aspects of fat acceptance . Chiefly , the ' I want to be fat but get a hunky male ' type of fat acceptance . There's a lot of criticism in the feminist community of figures like Megan Trainor who promote fat acceptance at the expense of skinny girls . That said , I don't think fat acceptance is going to be completely dismissed as a topic in the near future . There's too much intersectionality with other popular discussion threads . Women tend to be judged more on their physical appearance than men are . Women in fields like science , education , politics , etc . are criticized if they're not attractive enough . ( Or if they're too attractive and thus must be a ditz . ) Women are criticized more for having abnormal body-types than men . ( Buff women considered ' gross ' and ' mannish ' , waifish girls are ' boyish ' ' twigs ' or ' skinny bitches ' , and fat insults ) . A guy can be skinny , buff , or fat and receive fairly little criticism on his body type . Those are just to brief examples , but you can see how it'd be easy to take a ' fat acceptance ' slant to these feminist issues . I think the best way to disassociate fat acceptance isn't by completely removing it , but by focusing on more important issues instead . There's way more serious issues that deserve attention , and they should be discussed . Women of color , trans women , abused women , women in power , gender vs sex , history of feminism , how feminism effects men , etc . There's a reason you can major in this , it's a huge subject . There's so much material you can cover , fat acceptance can easily take a back burner . Elimination via omission , rather than actively booting them out is liable to be most successful .	EXP

1675	uncensorednews	every time a bubble pops it's still above the last time the bubble popped . Just because there's up and down doesn't mean up and down are equal and for the last <NUMBER> years up has out-paced down . Hence , net long-term growth . Which is even worse as that second ( third , fourth , fifth ) , bigger bubble doesn't restore the lost value but instead simply pumps more of that money into the line of fire . Let's take an example from that infamous housing bubble shall we ? Take real estate with an actual worth of 40k . Now , because housing in that area is trendy in <NUMBER> , you're easily able to sell your house for 100k , because dumb fucks can be trusted upon to do dumb fuck things . The Millers buy this property for 100k and , because they have no damn clue how to handle money , take up some hefty mortgages . Life's easy , the economy is booming , your neighbourhood continues to be in high demand , everybody has money and is willing to spend it so your new property is deemed very low-risk by Dumbfuck Bank and the Millers get great interest rates . Because the Millers are dumb fucks who can't handle money , they take up more and more debt as it's very cheap and spend it on useless stuff with no lasting value , like sports cars or luxury goods . Then boom , something happens . Let's say the local lake turns out to be contaminated with radioactive substances . It's all over the news and within days , your trendy neighbourhood goes from \ <NUMBER> in demand to dead last . Dumbfuck Bank sits down and discovers that their risk management is now completely off - mortgage rates up for everybody . Oopsies , now the Millers ' monthly rate went from <NUMBER> bucks to <NUMBER> bucks and they can no longer pay the interest rates on their mortgage , let alone paying off the mortgage itself . Turns out they're going bankrupt . Dumbfuck Bank starts seizing assets to cover their losses . That real estate they valued at 100k before turns out to sell for 41k - well shit , where can Dumbfuck Bank take the other 69k from ? Turns out there's nothing to salvage for Dumbfuck Bank - they have to cut their losses and pay those 69k out of their pockets . As a consequence , Dumbfuck Bank stock plummets . But wait a minute , Smartfuck Insurance had previously bought Dumbfuck Bank shares to do investment banking with retirement money they have at their disposal - well shit , now that's going belly up too . Now , if you keep repeating that scenario , and even increase the amount of money on the line , things won't get better . They'll get much MUCH worse . Yes , the bailouts could have been handled better . But that was because of lobbying , not because of the system . It doesn't matter for past generations why things happened . They happened , and as a consequence the money is gone . The ' why ' matters for current and future generations only because that's going to be the next gambling money . If the funds do run out , they'll do so before I'm old so it won't be us who get the short end of the stick and we'll be able to diagnose the problem and make a better system . What the fuck kind of logic is this ... Of course you get the short end of the stick , because YOU're going to have your taxes increased in an effort to restore the money those companies owe to your elders ( or , alternatively , the system collapses and you'll have to foot your old man's retirement home bill all by yourself ) - and on top of that , you have to put money on the shelf for yourself .

I honestly don't mind fat people if they are just overweight or even the lesser stages of obesity , yeah they could lose weight but that's a personal health issue at that point , they are not projecting their problem fatness onto other people like hamplanets do . Being a hambeast is as much a state of mind as it is a size of body . A sense of entitlement , that the world owes you because of your size . There is refusing to acknowledge the problem or accept responsibility . Selfishness , being bitter or resentful at people who are smaller than you and I also see lots of pettiness but I think that's petty people who got fat not fat people who became petty .	EXP

The people here majority aren't descendent of the founding fathers or anyone that was responsible for conquering this land , they are either here because of failed policies or political asylum . However it's not fair that they don't have a place , hate mongering and beating the drums is worthless ... There needs to be a plan for people to pack up and go back where they are capable to align under a country that supports them rather than continue to take ours away , it's pathetic they blame us , blame the people that sold you . They are the truly to blame . White people at least tried to fix things , however nothing is good enough ... The only way it will stop is by accepting the way the world is , we don't mix and no one else in the rest of the worlds countries is even trying to create the abomination that America has become . Why should we continue to listen to this type of non sense as the poster has initiated . If he doesn't like it get on the boat and leave , it would be fine with everyone that's rightfully from here .

2381	islam	What guarantee do I have that the woman I will marry would be right for me ? I think the problem stems from two different notions of marriage . I assume you were raised in the West , so your notion of marriage is very different from a more conservative and traditional idea of marriage . You are looking for a life partner it sounds . In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts . The concept of ' right for me ' doesn't exist in that set up , it's more of ' right for both families ' .	NOT
2382	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

Their Neopaganism isn't new , it's just old failed ideas remixed because they're too stupid to read the ancient sources for themselves . As for man being gods , yes indeed the context both in the New Testament and in Psalms indicates man is born as gods , as man is made in God's image , and woman in man's image . It's the first lie and a recurring lie from the dragon called Satan that is prevalent in all pagan religions stating that they can become "" gods "" if they do this or that evil thing .

So we can see Jesus refuting the Jews very well whom accused him of blasphemy while they themselves ironically were the ones blaspheming not just the Lord's anointed , but even themselves . As for claims that Christianity is Judeo based , that is nonsense . Clearly before Judah ( father of Jewry ) was Japheth ( father of whites ) and Japheth believed in God and was blessed by God .

2509	uncensorednews	"It's often impossible to get a restraining order quickly , or at all . And as you note , they have no effect on a person who chooses to ignore them . Victims often have no proof that they've been assaulted , held captive , and threatened with worse . And violent perps often can't be found even if their victim can convince authorities that there's sufficient grounds for arrest . Many violent perps are part of organized gangs , and arresting / jailing one of them just means they have a fellow gang member do their violence and murder for them . Some gang leaders have successfully ordered hits from inside federal prison , in some cases against "" snitches "" who are in a different prison . I'm not really sure how a lot of this is relevant , I feel we are drifting really off course . We are now talking about a violent domestic partner who is ordering a fellow gang member to kill his spouse , and yet I still think that we would agree in this situation , your average single mother probably wouldn't fare too well against a trained killer , even if armed . Why should she have to take a class ? She may already be quite familiar with guns ? Who decides what the class consists of , how much it costs , where it's held , and how often it's held ? I have a second home in a state where these infernal classes are required . I've seen ads in the local newspaper announcing that a class will be held on a certain date a month or more in the future . Even aside from cost , transportation issues , and conflicts with work schedule , that's hardly a meaningful option for someone who needs to protect themselves NOW . Like tonight . She should have to take a class because guns are inherently dangerous objects . If she is already familiar with guns , that's great , she will breeze through it . Also , this assumes that someone who is familiar enough with guns hasn't been licensed before in their life . If you instituted gun safety classes and they became the norm , you would have young adults learning alongside their parents , and they would get licensed at a young age . The issue with the scarcity of gun safety classes is that they are optional , and generally boring , so few people elect to take them , and that drives up the cost . Gun stores tend to have a lot of competition and it's not difficult to imagine a store throwing in a free lesson with a firearm $ XXX . If the store down the road charges $ <NUMBER> / class , which one are you gonna buy from ? Even aside from cost , transportation issues , and conflicts with work schedule , that's hardly a meaningful option for someone who needs to protect themselves NOW . Like tonight . This still seems like such a specific scenario you are painting . How frequently do Americans find themselves in a domestic violence scenario that is severe enough to warrant a last minute outing to a gun store ( assuming it's open ) , but not so urgent or life threatening that <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> isn't involved ? Also , when a desperate looking woman comes trotting into a gun store out of breath , saying she needs a gun TONIGHT , what responsible gun store owner says : "" yeah , this seems like a normal situation , here you go . "" They would talk to her , and get the authorities involved . In <NUMBER> , America needs its citizens to be able to protect themselves and each other from government . Just like when the Bill of Rights was ratified . When the BoR was ratified , there were no police . There were no neighborhood watches . There was no Nat'l Guard . There were no gated communities , no ADT security systems , no <NUMBER> , no paramedics , no immediate help of any kind . There were county sheriffs of sorts , but they didn't get involved in matters until it was supremely serious . Also , women had no rights , and our fictional wife beating husband could act with impunity . We also didn't have 100M guns throughout our country , and all the people who owned guns were familiar with them from childhood because they were a necessary life item . You can barely even compare the scenarios , other than the need to protect against tyranny and home invaders ."	EXP

"" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it .

Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say .

This last election though was the first time I got really involved in the political process . I foolishly thought that the Democratic Party was the Party looking out for the little guys , the normal every day Joes ... and I thought it was only the Republican politicians that were looking out for the interests of the wealthy elites . But after this last election ... there weren ’ t any more delusions about the Democratic establishment . I ’ m no socialist but I do believe our Crony Capitalism has turned us into an oligarchy . I personally feel there needs to at least be some government oversight and regulation ( although that comes with its own problems ) ... because right now these billion dollar corporations are buying out politicians and giving themselves free reign to fuck us all over . But I honestly don ’ t see things changing anytime soon so I ’ ve sort of become apathetic about our political system .	EXP

2884	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

Do people remember what things were like before multiculturalism ? You might still have similar levels of petty crime , but it wasn't as bad before . There's a dangerous criminal element that has grown in London and cities with brown skinned 2nd generations . Immigrants from Eastern Europe integrate better . And for all of our imperfections as humans , we still separate into tribes , it's ingrained in our DNA . Skin color plays a big role , in addition to culture , etc . In the next few decades , you will see less support for welfare programs from the general population . Taxpayers are ok with higher taxes when it's a support system for their own kinfolk . This is playing out in Sweden right now , where the Swedes don't see these newcomers as their own countrymen , so they are less in favor of high taxes to support services for them . It might help if they integrated better , but many groups don't care to . Thus exacerbating the problem .

3130	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

3245	uncensorednews	While I disagree that it's a comparable issue to women in combat units , I agree that lowering standards to fulfill a political agenda is utter bullshit and ultimately costs lives . There's a lot of sexism in the form of special accommodations for females in the military - fitness standards being the most glaring . IMO those standards should be job-specific , not sex . It doesn't make sense for some desk-jockey at Finance to be held to the same fitness standard as something our Security Forces personnel ; it makes even less sense for a chick in SF to be held to a lower standard than a dude in Finance ... like , what the flying fuck . I digress . The whole trangender thing imo would be more comparable to something like homosexuals in the military ; they represent a pretty strong deviation from the norm , but not necessarily in a way that interferes with their ability to do their job . Their brains are almost certainly wired differently , but using that as a basis to bar them from military service all together seems unnecessary . Perhaps there are things they're inherently worse at - okay , limit them from career fields dependent on that trait ; but if that's the case , there are probably also things they are better at than the average Joe - we should identify what that may be and allocate our personnel accordingly .

No way he'd be able to come on any of our backcountry canoe trips , he'd never survive . Not long ago he asked me to carry a bike to his truck a half block away . He ’ s that fucking lazy he either wouldn ’ t or can ’ t ride a damn bike <NUMBER> feet . The thing is he ’ s a super nice guy that ’ s actually friends with like the <NUMBER> hottest girls in my city . It ’ s insane , I don ’ t know how or why it ’ s happened but he ’ s super outgoing and gregarious . He ’ s built up this persona that gets us into every bar , club , event that we ’ d want without waiting and before we all settled down we never ran out of great looking women to party with . Between the other <NUMBER> of us , we ’ ve fucked at least <NUMBER> girls he ’ s “ wrangled ” for us over the years . The fat guy works as an anchor point for the rest of us so we look like greek gods in comparison … . I ’ ve had actual relationships with <NUMBER> girls that he fancied but they wouldn ’ t give him a look romantically . The 2nd girl , I stopped seeing because it was really making him down and well … . bro ’ s before hoes even if bro is a hippo-bro . Now that <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of us have grown into relationships , marriage , kids whatever , this guy still parties like we did <NUMBER> years ago . HE ’ s onto his 3rd crop of hot girls ( the previous two crops are now married with kids like us ) and they flock to the guy because he now gets them into the clubs etc . He ’ s constantly complaining about not being able to find a girl to settle down with but the girls he parties with and thinks he ’ s going to sleep with are literally choosing professional athletes over him and he can ’ t figure out why . I ’ m sure he knows why but he won ’ t admit it to himself . He makes comments about his weight and posts selfies from the gym only to be followed by a pic of his <NUMBER> calorie breakfast an hour later . Then his <NUMBER> calorie lunch an hour after that … . I don ’ t know why I ’ m ranting here , I feel terrible for this guy . I love him like a brother but he ’ s eternally unhappy because the only way he gets laid is when he hires a prostitute . He sees all of his best friends enjoying healthy active lives with great looking women and he equates happiness to sex and money . He ’ s got lots of expendable income but no happiness . He honestly makes me depressed just thinking about him . He ’ s the perfect example of how you can be the nicest guy in the world but if you ’ re a fat fuck females will just use you for whatever social benefit they can derive and then marry prince charming with the 6pack .

3840	sjwhate	He did not make any demands . He gave points and evidence to show that google may have been wrong in their assumptions on the disparity in numbers . If he had demanded that they agree with him and follow his rules then I could understand that may create an environment where they couldn't work together . ETA This is exactly what google are doing . You must agree with what we think is happening in the world , or shut the fuck up , or get fired . He attempted to help his company with evidence and improve their understanding of a subject . He made no immoral demands or statements . There may be good reasons to fire someone for things that they say . But if you held a meeting with your employees and then afterwards one of them said , look I listened to what you have to say , and I would hope you may consider these alternative view points . Then you would probably agree firing that person would be a little unfair . If you are running anything with an ideology rather than an open mind then I'd say you were creating an environment for everyone of your staff to have no option but to agree with it or risk being fired . If google thinks that is a healthy way to treat their employees then that's up to them . I agree that society is more important than a corporation in terms of its attitudes effect on a population . The point about google being able to hire anyone according to the image they want is kind of legit and kind of not . Any company should hire whoever they feel is best for the job . If they are hiring people based on who they are or what their skin colour is , then it's a racist practice . If googles ideology is to have everyone who works for them to be Indian , and nobody else can work there , they do not have the right to force that to happen . Ideological practices are what cause problems , rather than logical and factual reasoning . Which is what the person was trying to explain . Google didn't like this , because it's exactly what they are doing . you don't have a right to terminate someones contract just because they don't agree with you . If I come into work tomorrow and my employer said , look , we think that men are a rape risk and so we're going to have to make you all work in the same room . If I disagree with that idea they can't fire me for it . Workers have rights too . I'm not sure where this stands legally , but this whole should they shouldn't they fire him is blurry . I think the main point here , is that he did not say anything sexist or racist , he used evidence and reason , he suggested that he would like feedback and other ideas , but google did not want this . Their response was , what he said is incorrect , google does not believe in this so we fired him . That response is lacking in so many ways .	EXP

4052	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

Relationships - Have my soulmate and never been a party kind of person so never really had to worry about this . I'd laugh though if a fat person did try and flirt with me . I honestly don't think a fat person deserves to talk to me let alone try and flirt with me . I'd tell him straight up to fuck off and that he is fat . Complete nazi when it comes to fat people . No respect or sympathy for them . I honestly wouldn't mind them being put in concentration camps and forced to lose the weight . They are sick , a fucking disease and the worst types of people . People are starving in the world , and they gobble down loads of food . Children are dying trying to get even a little bit of education in some parts of the world , and fat people in the US and EUR ( and other countries ) have all the education in the world , and what do they do with it ? Nothing at all . Just continue to make excuses and stay fat . We have to pay for their health care , which I think is absurd when some healthy people can barely afford their own health care as is . Companies have to pay more to situate fat people , clothes , seats in airplanes ext which all equals out to everyone having to pay more . They are selfish , uncaring , unwilling to change freaks of nature that have no right even speaking to me , or any other healthy person . Not to mention they are killers when they have children . Just killing their own kids with food , if they would do that to their own children imagine wtf else they would do . I don't even know why this isn't considered child abuse . Then they own pets and make the pets unhealthy along with them . HONESTLY worst fucking people . Oh and they spit on the art of fashion with their circus tents , and fucking king size sheets they put around themselves and call that "" Fashion "" ... Concentration camps is what I'm voting for . Work - My boyfriend works at a lot of different places . The worst place he has worked out , won't say the companies name but they had like <NUMBER> fat chicks and <NUMBER> fat guy working there . My boyfriend and this other guy who were both skinny literally did all the work . The fat guy only came in once in a while cause he was manager , the four fat lards just sat around fucking talking and giggling all day . They were fucking cunts also . Had to call his work place one time because my boyfriend had broke his phone , it was urgent and I needed to talk to him ( something I don't want to talk about here sorry ) and the fat cunt proceeded to tell me "" We can't give out information if he works here or not , I can't get him because I can't tell you he works here "" I fucking told the lady I was his girlfriend and I knew he fucking worked there and that it was urgent that I talked to him . Finally one of the lards went and got him . Clearly they were just to lazy to get up and tell him someone was calling ffs . This was after me calling <NUMBER> times and seriously crying on the phone because it was an emergency . I honestly believed they weren't going to get him , and I didn't understand how they couldn't fucking care since it was urgent to me and I know my boyfriend found it urgent also . He was even pissed they didn't get him because it was important , not like I was calling just to bother him . My boyfriend came home stressed every single fucking day over those lards and I hope they all die . Constantly bitching at him , making his life hell . He had to work out in the freezing cold carrying stuff , + do their work also because they did none of it , and the manager didn't even fucking fire them . On top of everything the manager gave them money to all go out eating one time , like I said it's winter my boyfriend at the time is working all day , he barely was getting enough food when he got home it was whatever was there and then bed . So he was really happy about this . They went to some place called Dennys . My boyfriend was starving he got like a sandwich , some potatoes and vegetables , then a huge bowl of soup after , and a piece of pie . He's not fat but just a fucking man that's hungry as fuck . Hasn't had a proper meal in idk how long ( before I was living with him ) and one of those fat fucking lards had the nerve to come up to him and tell him they think he ordered to much , that the manager was paying and he should be more respectful . GOD if I ever see that cunt I'll beat her to death I swear it . He was working constantly more then he should have had to , because he was also doing those other fat bitches work him and that other guy , and he was imo getting paid shit for it , so imo he didn't order to much and he should have ordered more because that shit fat lard manager owed him more . Fuck fat people . They honestly shouldn't be hired at any job . They are lazy , they are rude , they whine , complain , and they simply are not physically fit or mentally fit for any job I can even think of . My boyfriend had a crazy nervous break down over that job and eventually decided for his own health it was best to just quit and find a new job . fuck planets ."	EXP

4220	uncensorednews	"“ Goy ” is a Jewish word used to refer to non-Jews . Let's be very clear about this - "" Goy "" or "" Goyim "" is by no means a simple little term for gentiles . There are several jewish holy texts regarding "" goyim "" mostly contained within the jewish Talmud and by no means is "" goyim "" something innocent . It denotes that gentiles are brainless cattle whose sole purpose in life is to serve and die for jewish ( "" God's Chosen People "" ) interests . The profane nature of this term is extensively present in the Talmud and would make things in the old testament seem tame , doctrines that state it is okay to steal from , rape and murder goyim freely , claims that a million goyim lives aren't worth a single jewish finger nail and more writings along the same thought pattern . Contrary to what many jews ( and the good goyim they employ ) this is not some bizarre conspiracy theory attributed to fascists / nazis / whatever buzz word they use at the time . All of evidence of what "" goyim "" means can be read in their own sacred books presuming you're reading one that hasn't been doctored to appear more gentile friendly .

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

However , the more involved I get , the more disturbed I get by the sheer level of fatlogic and general fat-ness of the community . Like , this chick is common . Either furries are nerdy twigs with thick glasses and braces , or they ’ re something out of / r / justneckbeardthings ; fat as a whale , wearing a fedora , and cracking distasteful sexual jokes in public . You know , standard fat nerd with no social skills shit . But that ’ s not the worst part about the furry community . Most people look nothing like their furry avatar , or fursona . Generally , all of them are a fatties ’ wet dream . Tall , athletic , muscular , and most of all … not fat . You can guess where this is going . Jesus . Fucking . Christ . The difference is alarming sometimes . Automatically , I assume a furry is fat as anything unless proven otherwise . All of them , besides the occasional nerdy twig , are at least overweight if not obese . While I ’ ve managed to gather a group of shitlords around me who ’ re into fitness and like , actually vaguely looking human , everyone else is so damn fat it ’ s horrifying . Furries in general are fatty-escapist shit taken to an extreme . All obeast fursonas have at least a six-pack , if not eight , if male , and are into the negative dress sizes if female . None of them are fat unless they ’ re into that disgusting fetish . It ’ s the ultimate proof of fat logic . While they can ’ t escape being fat , they realize how ugly their excess adipose makes them , and so create fursonas that ’ re uber-attractive as a form of compensation for that . Ugh … It ’ s hard being a furry sometimes . Literally , have a BMI of under <NUMBER> , girl or guy , and people get really creepy on you . I've been touched , groped , cat-called ( I'm a guy ) ... you name it , I've had it done to me , and I'm a high seven <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . I'm not smokin ' hot .

Regular bloodwork would catch it if it progresses to the point where it significantly affects thyroid function . My understanding is that if you have it , you will eventually require replacement therapy . <NUMBER> . Type <NUMBER> diabetes does have a genetic component but it's actually less significant than type <NUMBER> diabetes ( yes , type <NUMBER> diabetes has a significant genetic component . In some cases , dietary changes and exercise can halt progression but there are plenty of people who are at a healthy weight and eat a healthy diet who develop type <NUMBER> ) . The generally accepted theory is that type <NUMBER> diabetes develops when you have a genetic predisposition to the condition but then contract a virus that triggers the onset . Having relatives with type <NUMBER> increases your risk of developing type <NUMBER> and other autoimmune conditions . <NUMBER> . It's pretty easy to monitor for the development of type <NUMBER> . Each year you should have your glucose and a1c checked . If you develop any symptoms ( excessive thirst , weight loss , frequent urination , recurrent infections ) , you should get to a doctor ASAP . If your symptoms progress or get really severe , or you have blurred vision , funny smelling breath , rapid breathing , you should go to an ER . You can also be checked for antibodies , which can show if you're at high risk for the condition . <NUMBER> . Remember that type <NUMBER> can develop at ANY age , and women in particular are prone to developing it in their 30s ( this happened to Mary Tyler Moore ) , which is when they are at most risk for developing all autoimmune conditions . Pregnancy can also trigger the condition in some women . <NUMBER> . It's important that if you do develop diabetes , you're very clear about your history with an autoimmune condition and your family's history of type <NUMBER> . Unfortunately , many adults who develop type <NUMBER> are misdiagnosed with type <NUMBER> initially and treated as such . This can have deadly consequences because type 1s need insulin to survive . <NUMBER> . If your family history for type <NUMBER> is strong , you may be able to enroll in TrialNet , which provides free screening and sometimes tests therapies for delaying onset in people who are at risk .

4952	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

5132	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

5204	uncensorednews	First thank you for giving me a reason to look into this . It's been interesting . This is not going to be the best arguments , but I found it interesting nonetheless As I dont have the software to quickly search court cases I had to slog through crap . In \ <NUMBER> . You can easily make the argument without need for federal precedent that these rules were invoked as a form of selective punishment as almost every student breaks these laws on a daily basis . By simply having their phones on in their pocket . And that the school administration used it to target this guy . I think it gets thrown out easily . Earlier I was making the argument for defence from the professor , not the school and I was incorrect to try that direction . This is from the school and not the professor . As to \ <NUMBER> . Legally , The 2nd court of appeals ruled in <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> - cv Caro v . Weintraub that “ We affirm , and , in so doing , hold that the exception to the one-party consent provision of <NUMBER> U . S . C . § <NUMBER> ( <NUMBER> ) ( d ) requires that a communication be intercepted for the purpose of a tortious or criminal act that is independent of the intentional act of recording , ” But that's legally and I am not sure this applies in this case . Though I think it or something close to it should hold up against the teachers union if they go after the student . A petty argument is that this was not done on tape . And that the rule is outdated and no longer applies . If I searched way longer than I feel like I could most likely come up with some precedent . Also nitpicky , all you would have to do is find a few incidences of this occurring and show no response by the school to also make it look like a subjectively and maliciously applied in this instance . And in this day and age of facebook it should only be an afternoon's work to find material . You make the very good point that these rules were signed off by a lawyer and I agree . But I believe from the wording that it was done in the <NUMBER> ' s or even earlier and the school has been negligent in updating them with new vernacular and context . This was fun nonetheless .	EXP
5205	videos	I had actually forgotten about that . I do know a little about this stuff , emphasis on the ' little ' . Without doing any googling , what I remember about the mini-shuttle is that is was a testbed for the SR - <NUMBER> follow-on , sometimes known as the ' Aurora ' , and not intended as a production craft . I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

5287	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	"You do realize that animals eat plants , right ? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten ? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

Im now just repeating myself , but the problem isn't the fact that white people happen to be a majority based on numbers , the issue is the social connotations of the word majority as if it implies superiority by nature . You might disagree with this , but im firmly of the belief that there is a systemic bias in favour of white people in our culture , and it all stems back to the idea of ' minority ' class and ' majority ' class . To anyone arguing the bias doesn't exist , you only need to look back <NUMBER> years , not even a lifetime , and it was historical fact . White people were literally seen as the superior race . Keep going back and it's subjugation a long way down . Im not saying white people need to be guilty of this , im just highlighting that this sense of white superiority is ingrained in our culture . It doesn't disapear in a couple generations . This is why i feel the need to call out people propagating the idea of an attack against the white majority . It's not about the white , it's about the majority . It's a thinly veiled attempt to call for defense of historical white supremacy . In reality no one's attacking you . People just want equality . There is no other ' class ' that gets to take over . The class is human . It's about bringing the groups together into one , not dragging one down so another can rise .

5567	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

5621	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

5706	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> .

There were people in the region before whitey showed up and it makes one wonder just why there was no infrastructure to begin with until the big bad white man came along . You act as though the government disappeared entirely and the earth was salted when Rhodesia fell . These things happened because of the leadership that entered after Rhodesia's fall . Do you even know anything about Mugabe ? The obscene dictator who seized control and chased out the big bad whitey ? This was not a corrupt official appointed by vengeful whites so honestly if you're going to blame anyone for the state Zimbabwe is in it's not going to be the white boogeyman , it's going to be Mugabe and his horrid administration . With that in mind though , what is preventing those agricultural techniques from being used again ? I'm pushing the topic of food hard here because Zimbabwe has longed suffered a starvation problem and is largely what has a dictator who despises whites people begging them to return . You'd think these people who were handed a nation whose ability to cultivate such fertile fields and crops from them would managed to get their shit together after thirty seven years .

I'm curious where I said the executive branch should do the job of the judiciary branch . It seems like you have serious projection issues .

I'm not sure whether the executive or legislative branch is in charge of changing the rules banning us from sending violent criminals back to the countries they came from , but whichever one it is , they should do it . That will allow the judiciary branch to send violent criminals back to where they came from when they are found to be violent criminals .

5734	gaming	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

5870	fatpeoplehate	Hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism and Graves disease are all fairly common in my family . During the initial stages of the disease you either gain a lot of weight very quickly or lose it very quickly . Then the doctor puts you on medication and begins working on the proper dose . During this time you will gain weight for the most part ( though my uncle lost weight until he looked skeletal ) . The medication is adjusted until crazy weight gain / loss is controlled and the person is then expected to live a healthy life and lose the extra weight or gain back weight until they look human again . PCOS can cause difficult weight loss but doctors work with you to try and help you work with your body to lose it since the condition is exacerbated by being overweight . Also autoimmune treatments when they put you on steroids cause weight gain . It is expected though that once equilibrium is reached you lose the extra weight . This is why I hate hearing about condishuns . :/	IMP
