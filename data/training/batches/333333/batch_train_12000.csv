29	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

157	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general .

You don't get to have both . So now you ARE saying that you think I'm offended by it ? But you just said you never claimed that . You're spewing so much bullshit you can't keep it straight . Except they don't , if you read it you would know this Except I did . The reason for originally being taken off air and for being permanently taken off air were decisions made by two different groups of people . Reading comprehension is hard for you I guess . You literally proved my point for me , it says that obscenity was not the grounds for his punishment . So you admit that the case has no bearing on "" obscene language "" that you are claiming the college student made . Glad you agree finally . Nope . His argument was that the original punishment did not include "" obscene language "" but the school later added it on . And the Supreme Court sided with the school . They are completely separate . There are many things you can do in college that you can not in high school . You are simply refusing to acknowledge this since your entire argument is based on court cases with high school students . There are different guidelines and rules , no matter how much you want to say their isn't you are wrong . No dipshit , their constitutional rights to not change when you graduate high school . Show me one single precedent for this . And who exactly decides this ? The FCC . My god you are dumb . The FCC does NOT have jurisdiction over what is or is not a violation of a person's freedom of speech . They only enforce previous decisions on what is or isn't allowed in the constitution . They do not get to interpret the speech on their own . Otherwise known as unsubstantiated bullshit . You are showing how little you actually know . Yeah , that's why I said it was likely a conduct violation . They were not at the school , they were in a public forum . No matter how you try to approach this it is simply a fact . The FCC is the authority in this situation . Yes , they were . How are you so wrong on such basic shit ? It's a UNIVERSITY radio station on the UNIVERSITY campus using UNIVERSITY facilities and equipment . So you have no proof of anything you are trying to say , interesting . As far as the conduct violation , no . It was a guess . A public student is a public student , regardless of the level of education . Wrong again . You know you actually have to provide proof for that , right ? Your proof only works if high school and college are considered the same . They are not . If you are going to spout bullshit at least have the sources to back it up , otherwise you just look like a moron . Says the guy who has provided no sources showing university students and high school students have different first amendment rights . Come to think of it , have you provided any sources whatsoever ? So that means that you just called yourself a moron . Good job , bud . Still a fact that using the word tranny was not the reason he was removed . Debates have never been the lefts strong suit , stick with finding new ways to look idiotic since you guys are very good at that . That is demonstrably the reason why they were originally taken off air . “ And so for today I am going to have you stop your show . Specifically tranny . That is a hate slur it is not allowed on radio . I need you to leave . ” As she says these words , a campus police officer stands in the background , the video shows "" The only way you would win this debate is if I got tired of reading your retarded bullshit lies and unsupported claims ."

RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , <NUMBER> , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

388	fatpeoplehate	"I just joined this subreddit yesterday , and never could I have imagined that I would find a topic I felt I HAD to comment on this soon after subscribing . This is a topic I have been dying to discuss openly , but is considered rather taboo in what people I know call the "" rare performance art community . "" I am a percussionist , and have been for about <NUMBER> years now . Started off learning Afro and Latin rhythms , and eventually became interested in Middle Easter rhythms . A group of us used to meet at a local park for sessions on Sundays . Now mind you , we weren't some hippie drum circle , we were made up of very skilled percussionists , some of which have been playing for over <NUMBER> years . In that group is one of my best friends , and my drumming brother . We are awesome playing off of each other and can communicate mid rhythm with just glances and nods . <NUMBER> years of playing side by side will do that to you . One Sunday , we were approached by two very fit and attractive girls , asking us if we would be interested in expanding our Mid East drumming knowledge and visit them during one of their belly dance practices . Of course , we agreed . We showed up , and these were by far the most physically fit women I have ever laid eyes on . You could shoot a cannon at their stomachs , and the cannonball would have shattered . Needless to say , we agreed to start working with them , and little did we know how much of a work out it would be for us . Those girls can shimmy and shake at speeds that are very difficult to keep up with on the drum . You see , belly dancers and drummers go hand in hand , and when you work together long enough , you end up forming a relationship that can only really be expressed through rhythm and dance . Each pop , ting , or bang I make on the drum is in turn mirrored by a movement in the dancers hips or stomach . Not only that , to play and dance to the tempo these rhythms are supposed to be played requires top physical shape , and a fairly strong tolerance for the pain of muscle cramps . For a couple years , we did great shows with these girls . Casino gigs , private corporate parties , etc . Both my drumming friend and I ended up each dating girls from the group , which made the experience of drumming for them that much more personal and rewarding . Everything was choreographed , and we were constantly pushing ourselves to the limit of endurance and speed . Then something horrible happened ... There teacher started offering "" casual "" courses for "" fitness "" reasons . I am sure she thought she would get some college girls that need to shed a pound or two of that freshmen beer weight , but what she got instead was a stampede of water buffalo . Obese women of all ages signed up , and since the teacher offered to pay my buddy and I to drum for the "" casual "" courses , we started helping out . It was horrible . Not just because I wanted to pull my eyes out , but because there was no challenge . Even after the girls learned the moves and practiced often , the simply could not hold up the the speed we were used to drumming at . Not only that , my friend and I weren't able to make out the specific and individual movements of their hips and bellies , which is often helps keep us on track with where we are in the song . After about a year , one of the moo cow girls quit and started teaching her own classes . From there , it spiraled out of control . More and more fat girls started belly dancing , and next thing we know , they are performing for free ( bc no one would pay them to see that shit ) in all sorts of places . Suddenly , people just didn't want to see belly dance at all . There were too many fat girls doing it , and people just quit reaching out to the belly dance community as a whole . As a result , it has been over <NUMBER> years since I have picked up my doumbek to play for a belly dancer of talent . It really sucks how fat girls have ruined it for the people that really took it seriously . You see , there are some things that physically fit dancers can do that the fat dancers simply cannot . Many of the moves are very subtle , and each hit of the drum is supposed to be mirrored by the subtle movements . When an obese dancer attempts this , one body movement is used for <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> or even <NUMBER> drum hits . Partially because they can't keep up with the speed , and partially because their fat jiggles , and masks any other movements they might be trying to make underneath all the blubber . Sure , you are "" supposed to have something to shake "" , but per the standards of M . E . drumming and belly dancing , the movements are ALL supposed to be visible in your muscles and bones , not in the flapping or your fat . Fat girls can claim all they want that this is a style of dance they have just as much right to do , but in reality , their bodies simply aren't cut out for it . Not only that , but because most of the teachers that work with the overweight girls won't push them to try , therefore they never get pushed enough to shed off the pounds . Most view their weight as a limiter , and not something that can be lost with the same hard work the fit girls put in . Holy shit . I had no idea that would be this long ... TLDR : I drummed for physically fit belly dancers . Fat belly dancers simply are not physically cut out to perform in the moves at the speeds the traditional dance style calls for ."	EXP

453	milliondollarextreme	Automation actually drives prices down so it would be helping those who have less money . This is wrong . Interest , capital and rent will always be costs of production for a business , whereas labor may not be . Certainly labor is the most expendable of these factors as there is and always has been a systemic glut . As labor shrinks to a minimum out of the total costs of production , rent , capital and interest will make up the remainder of the income streams . Therefore the lower the labor costs in an economy , the greater the disparity between the purchasing power of the currency and labor-based income , as well as demand in general for that matter . TL ;D R - Even if automation drives labor to zero , the costs of business will remain non-zero , and therefore the reduction of labor costs by necessity only benefits those whose incomes are non-labor derived . And as for people not deserving to struggle , struggle isn't something inflicted upon one person by another . Don't confuse human systems with a state of nature . You're discussing the pros and cons of economic ideologies , not whether humans were born into struggle . For the record though , medieval peasants worked less hours than most people in the 1st world do today .	EXP

The people who built this country ( black and white ) are being replaced by Central American mestizos who have no legal claim to this country .

He's stated how miserable of a struggle it was , how he could have utilized his time better , and is warning people to face the reality that not everyone is going to make it . Who knows where they'd be if Sam didn't fight for his own relevance by not only making consistently good content , but forcing himself into the public consciousness through his provocative publicity stunts .

684	milliondollarextreme	"Holy shit are you dead set on announcing your utter contempt for thinking things through . Not really , you're assuming too much to make a point . Is the lesson to stop handing propaganda victories to your enemies too tough to digest ? HA . Another MUH PR fag . That shit never works because if your enemy is in charge of the distribution of propaganda then there is no amount of begging that you can do to change what they will publish . Moreover trust in the media is at the lowest its ever been as the internet becomes more widespread . Go back to gaymergate days and find out why constantly capitulating to their enemies for good PR flooded their movement with leftist politics and brought about their eventual downfall . Muh pr has always been a losing strategy and if you actually endorse it then you will lose . A good recent example is cnn blackmail , maybe political strategy isnt your thing And what strategy do you propose besides the always losing muh pr strategy ? Ridicule and truth are effective strategies , it got trump in the white house and its turned generation z into the most conservative generation weve seen in decades . Socialist policies are already killing this country , its technically living own borrowed time , once it collapses ( and it will , no bubble lasts forever and keynes admitted that the end result of his economics is "" who cares , we'll be dead by then "" ) there is nothing that will attract these iphone owning , starcucks loving , materialistic revolutionaries of the left . Antifags and shit like blm are either paid by soros or literal larpers who refuse to come to terms with the fact that marx was wrong and capitalism did not die because it provided more goods to the worker than socialism and communism ever could . The proper way to handle muh car of peace or muh nazis incident is to use video of the event to show the centrists what side to pick . Emotional blackmail works well too , go tell a british leftist the myriad of rapes of children are on her as she voted to import the very rapists responsible and the PC policies that kept their operation running . The best strategy you can induce is to ask questions because your average leftie cannot provide a logical answer or justification for their beliefs exposing their cult mentality . Nah I'm just cucking . Keep trying to resuscitate "" dems r real racists "" for killing of civilians , and the Nazi Movement . Just make sure you don't question why Spencer insists you preform the CPR on his little Richard . You bring up spencer like i actually give a single shit about some e-celeb who is only there to make a profit . Dems are real racists is a fact though as a strategy its horrible because it falls under muh PR and because everyone is born racist due to the tribal nature of humans . "" I'm not racist , dems r real racists ! "" Meanwhile fake news reports the opposite . Sorry if my insults aren't good enough , to be fair though nothing could be quite as humiliating as living your daily life as a True Believer of the National Socialist Movement Admitting hitler loved his people , nation and did incredibly positive things such as rebuild an econony without kike banking , putting millions back to work , eliminating the crushing debt imposed on them via the treaty of Versailles , advancement of animal rights , preservation of nature , etc . is all just a matter of admitting the truth of a mans policies and actions . I dont care one bit for nazism , socialism will never work in the long run and it always leads to mass slaughter . I'm merely a white nationalist and even hold some libertarian ideals to mix with a traditionalist view of society . and their never-ending blunders and their worship of ineffectual shysters . Muh nazis are larping about a time that they will never live . Literally the "" born in the wrong generation "" meme but applied to politics . Same with the leftists who desperately wanted to go die in a gulag in communist russia or live in the hippie movement ."	EXP

942	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

1222	hockey	"I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement : "" In short , it is illegeal specifically ... "" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

She banned a guy for asking "" how did historians arrive at the six million number , "" I'm not kidding or making that up . The sort of consensus that you've seen , in such an environment , is by design , not by neutral historians following evidence . The Soviet Union was being extremely aggressive in its foreign policy in <NUMBER> , particularly , and of course completely escaped blame for splitting up Poland with Germany in <NUMBER> , while Germany apparently deserved to be destroyed for it . The Winter War against Finland everybody knows , but the annexation of the Baltic states , Bessarabia and North Bukovina , and Vyacheslav Molotov's demands at a subsequent meeting with Joachim von Ribbentrop and Hitler made it apparent to Hitler at least that the Soviets were intent on bullying a Germany weakened from the Battle of France into concessions that would have doomed its oil supply , and future ability to defend itself . All this is completely overlooked in the leadup to World War II . Whereas everybody is aware of Germany "" taking over the world "" ( as if the British and French had not already done so ) by peacefully reclaiming and occupying German speaking lands it held before World War II in the Rhineland , Bohemia , Poland , and the Anschluss , which was merely a lesser realization of Großdeutschland delayed by <NUMBER> years , and welcomed by its population , nobody pays the slightest mind to the Soviet Union spreading communism westward toward Europe ; there was no Munich Conference for it , no discussion whatsoever about what all this portended , despite the tens of millions dead from the Russian Civil War , the Kronstadt Rebellion , war communism , the Five Year Plans , collectivization , the Holodomor , the Great Purge , compared to ... broken glass of store windows from Kristallnacht . The composition of many of the commissars forcing peasants onto kolkhoz while deporting so-called "" kulaks "" as revenge for Kishinev and other pogroms , and that of the victims of the Night of Broken Glass , and the international press , make the reasons for this valuing of a stubbed toenail over a genocide abundantly clear . Without looking , I'm sure they'll talk about the Five Year Plans , how Stalin said they had to advance <NUMBER> years in <NUMBER> , Stalin's freakout after Barbarossa launched . What they won't talk about is Hans-Ulrich Rudel and others ' observations of Soviet positions , which were curiously extended far westward in positions that would have made zero sense for defense in depth . That's the problem with that sub and establishment historians , they determine the parameters of the discussion before it even begins . With the growth and dominance of the Holocaust Industry , taxpayer-funded Holocaust museums , Israel and the U . S . ' s special relationship , and the overwhelming presence and influence of Jews and Jewish ideas in History Departments , all this is simply a taboo subject , or as close to such as to make a pariah of even a Jew like Arno Mayer , though he of course has seen his prospects remain in a better state than , say , Germar Rudolf . This can be seen all the way down to even petty censorship on internet fora like reddit , where asking questions and looking into a topic is grounds for being silenced . Not for the Holodomor , not for the Bengal famine , not for the Taiping Rebellion or the Great Leap Forward , only for one topic , and the suffering of one people . Any deviation from the gospel ( except when the Auschwitz and Majdanek museums do it , or "" functionalists "" like Christopher Browning ) is to be seen as wrong , it's an article of faith that "" Holocaust Denial "" is a monolith of deviance that is to be pathologized , and its uniform adherents to be slandered , fired , and humiliated , when not imprisoned outside the U . S . Understanding this bizarre climate is key to understanding why you've got the responses that you have . Rather than listening to those spin doctors and their pre-ordained conclusions , just listen to Hitler himself discuss the run up to Barbarossa , his reluctant decision to launch it over the objections of his generals , and the massive tank buildup which had been going on in the Soviet Union and directed at western Europe . Really interesting bit of history , he was secretly recorded talking with Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim , the great Finnish general , on a train in <NUMBER> , [ right here . ] ( <URL> Be very careful on looking to wikipedia for anything accurate , especially regarding the Holocaust . Like most major media of information , there are people behind the scenes making sure that a very ... [ favorable interpretation ] ( <URL> is put forward , from their perspective . It's ultimately as reliable as talking to a guy on the street . It's not a crazy conspiracy , not by estherke , or those wikipedia editors , or the media , it's just people looking out for their own people's interests . All it means is that it takes an extra level of looking into things , because there can sometimes be a deliberate veil placed between us and the truth . Aeschylus's observation that truth is the first casualty of war holds true to today , and the largest war in history has predictably had the most untruth attached to it ."	EXP

1571	gameofthrones	After resurrecting Jon , Melisandre burns Shireen to summon a dragon at Dragonstone . This dragon attacks Storm's End , which Aegon has conquered , and he tames it . Victarion makes his way to Meereen , finds Dany absent , and uses the horn to tame Viserion and find Dany . They and Tyrion's company finally arrive in Westeros . The Others destroy the Wall and invade the North . Jon follows them down , they gut Ramsay and Roose , he reunites with Stannis , and eventually meets with Dany . Somewhere around this point R + L is revealed and he manages to tame Rhaegal . Dany and Stannis meet , find that they are opposed , and get into a bitter fight . Both of them as well as Drogon die in a power struggle . In some horrible situation , Arya appears without her own face and Jon kills her , imbuing her spirit into Longclaw which becomes the true Lightbringer . Stannis ' men and the Unsullied fall behind Jon and he leads a united army south . They meet with Aegon , march on King's Landing , and plant Aegon on the throne . The final three heads of the dragon are Aegon , Jon , and Victarion and they crush the white walkers forever . Their reign lasts a thousand years	NOT

This fat fat waddles in and starts chainsmoking , while gabbing on her phone ( ear buds in of course , ignoring everything going on around her ) , hot-boxing the whole place . Bunch of people ended up leaving and waiting outside . My blood pressure skyrocketed and I decided to leave before I lost it . Then , just today , I see the same landwhale doing the same thing to some poor guy on the other side . Although she _was_ outside the bus stop , the smoke was going directly into the enclosure ( there was a guy swatting the smoke away before he yelled something and moved out ) . The kicker is , when the bus finally came , she didn't even get on . Like she was just hanging out there being fat useless bitch , killing herself and everyone around her with one of her filthy habits , most likely supported by the taxpayer .	EXP

1652	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

1914	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks . Male Hollywood already knows that chick flicks are soul-sucking monstrosities that should be taken out back and shot . Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

1958	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

The individual before the machine , and the machine at its root only to the support of the life , prosperity , and freedom of each individual bar none . When you label me a racist you rob me of status within the machine ... a machine which has lost its way and must be reassembled into the new form . The new form which denies the killing , torture , and mental enslavement of any individual on the planet and places the cessation of these atrocities as its highest function . All other designs are bereft of their status . There will only be one monoculture , and if you support in its inclusion the demand for inroads into the individual psyche you will see such designs fail as they are replaced by the design outlined here . Adopt early , for the road is long and hard and the fate of the human species , neigh all life on Earth , hangs on the rapidity of this new machine's adoption .	EXP

2306	holocaust	"Hope this answers your question , and I guarantee if you search you will be able to verify all that I've presented . Good luck You think it requires searching to refute often-repeated lies ? That's cute . All I wonder is if you really believe the bullshit you're spouting or if you're an even worse kind of denier - the kind who knows he's lying and does it either for the appreciation lauded upon him by his peers or to recruit others to his cause for personal gain . Truly , your parents , grandparents and their generations are ashamed of you . It occurred at Treblinka where the 700k - 900k victims were gassed with diesel fumes , corpses buried , then dug up and cremated en masse to "" cover up the crimes , "" I think you Problem is , there are no train records or aerial photographs that establish the delivery or existence of fuel adequate to accomplish the task , so it becomes necessary that the bodies must have been combustible without such means . That's not even to mention the implausibility of the scale of such an operation during such a short period . <NUMBER> - Fuel was on site . Besides wood , there were diesel engines . Perhaps you don't know this but humans are very , very combustible and have been burned to ash before the invention of petrol or discovery of magnesium . Human fat is an excellent propellant and clothing is an excellent wick . Don't believe , please go sleep with a cigarette burning . <NUMBER> - Because fuel delivery is not necessary it is also not necessary that combustion must occur without fuel . <NUMBER> - You believe it's out of the realm of possibility to incinerate a lot of people in a short time . Cute . There are so many examples from history that you already know about that I am sure you know how ridiculous that claim is . But , as pointed out , there's already photographic and scientific evidence of why you're wrong , so , doesn't matter . I assume you're talking specifically about the conspiracy to perpetrate the Hoax Yes , the hoax that the holocaust did not occur . You make a good attempt to deflect the accusation and chase a red herring and that in itself is enough evidence to show anyone that you cannot refute it . You know there's no conspiracy to fabricate the holocaust , and so you know you can't find evidence , and so you try to redirect . I'm sure anyone reading this will see that clearly , and not fall into the wall of delusion that is your essay , since I'm now pointing it out . :) Your plan isn't a bad one - redirect , confuse and drown - but it doesn't really work in text when you're dealing with a thinking human being , does it ? No , I would say not . Why is it that you loudmouths always try to preach and carry on so like that douche who recently got mouthpunched ? the actual Holocaust itself , for which there is in fact no existing evidence of communication ? LOL that's a fact is it ? <URL> <URL> It's like you don't even have Google . Is there anything else you'd like to me to find for you ? You seem challenged . As for your ' evidence ' it's an interesting memo , certainly , and it says one thing : Concentrate on the atrocities committed against the Jews and not on the atrocities that will be committed by the red army . I ... don't see where it says those atrocities against Jews didn't occur . Can you possibly point that out to me ? I'm sorry - it doesn't seem to be the smoking gun you think it is . Hardly even noteworthy , a typical political move . When an ally is bad distract . Simple . Just like you try to do - the Nazis were evil and you try to say , no the Jews were . Simple , yeah ? The wartime propaganda of extermination and death camps ( much of which was published before historians assert that the "" Holocaust "" ever began ) was simply validated in post-war efforts to cleanse Germany of Nazi party affiliation . Yes , it was . And rightly so You think the German people should have continued to live with the wool pulled over their eyes about what was happening ? And it was quite simply validated , true . Propaganda ... this word , at the time and before it , simply meant ( and technically STILL means ) distributed information . It doesn't mean true or false . If you think it does you might want to rethink that considering all the shit your dear leader published against Jews was also called propaganda . The Allied powers viewed it as necessary to accomplish a final defeat of Nazism and to validate the very nasty bombing campaign that resulted in millions of German civilians losing their lives What ? They had no need . There was no anti-war sentiment at home . You're ridiculous . Please , do provide proof of this nonsense . and the lie that began as completely fictional ( even historians recognize this ) bellylaugh.jpg <NUMBER> extermination rumors as part of the warmongering campaign of FDR finally stuck and is now written into the history books as absolute , unquestionable fact . Um ... wot ? People in America had no idea there was anything like this going on . There were some rumors , and everyone knew that the German Charlie Chaplin wannabe was an antisemite but they didn't really care - europe's problem - and there was plenty of antisemitism in the USA at the time as well . Lord have mercy . Get a clue . You've been fed so many lies it's amazing . Largely this is due to powerful Jewish groups co-opting the narrative shortly after the war to accomplish their own political goals ( most notably at the time the Zionists ) . And here comes the crazy . This would be part of that , "" Invisible non-communicating worldwide conspiracy , "" I first asked you about . Retarded . Seriously .

Without them , NONE OF US WOULD BE HERE ! We would still live in the stone ages . I mean , what other group can be said to be wholly responsible for the major advancements of modern society ? Come the fuck on . As a Latino man , I thank white Dudes every day for what they have accomplished that make my life easier . No other group deserves that praise . Just because he isn't white doesn't mean he should not speak his mind about issues that affect him , even if it does so indirectly . Liberals continue to LOSE simply because many of them have never truly grown up . It's like dealing with children . How do you argue with a child about issues that concern adults ? It's ultimately pointless . I didn't know who he was before , but all this shit has made me a fan . I subscribed and I hate Youtube personalities . He has gained a new fan for not following the diseased and uninformed liberal narrative ."	EXP

2438	uncensorednews	It's kind of fucked up , like how castle doctrine is worded in some US states - warning shots , verbal warnings or shooting to disable rather than kill can get you an attempted murder charge whereas killing the person ( even if it's an old man with Alzheimer's who thought it was his house or a drunk teenager pulling a dumb prank ) means they won't live to testify against you , so it's legally advisable to go for the kill no matter what . China is seeing something similar with the hit-and-run laws there , if you're hit by a Chinese motorist then chances are you'll testify against them , so Chinese pedestrians who are non-fatally hit are often mowed down on a second pass by the panicked driver to eliminate the key witness to the crime .

Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

2935	uncensorednews	This points to an even worse problem : we took a massive amount of resources that could have made Africa a self-sufficient , competing nation national block with a high standard of living and we mismanaged almost every penny . Same for all sorts of foreign aid . I understand the impulse to help , but you need to start from first principles with these things . You can't just chuck money and tech into a society ; then it isn't theirs , and it gets misused or squandered . Start with the culture . What do they value ? How do you communicate ? How do they see their world and evaluate their quality of life ? Now , apply that to education . Don't just build schools , make sure kids can get to them . Make sure the teaching is effective , and give the kids easy access to information of all sorts for self-directed learning . Make sure it's communicated in a way that they can value within the scope of their own culture and experience . Next , set up small financial institutions . Design systems with existing , low-tech solutions to enable the flow of credit and debit . Raise small , family-owned institutions to do things like microcrediting and agricultural co-ops . Again , understanding the culture and social fabric is key to making this work . Who loans to whom , and for what reasons ? Are there certain protocols for settling financial disputes ? Make sure you marry that into the system , or at least put up some kind of interface to weld them together . Otherwise , in the best-case scenario , nobody uses it . At the same time , work with local farmers , elders , and craftspeople to develop more efficient agriculture and transport infrastructure for goods . Listen to the locals here , because they know the land better than you . Take that and mix it with a heavy dose of ecological engineering and sustainable techniques , the lower-tech the better . Toss the result to the kids and the local makers ; I've seen some truly brilliant solutions come out of that last step before implementation . Never underestimate a curious kid or a resourceful scrap metal artist . Finally , empower the populace to protect themselves from predation . Train them in basic self-defense , how to counter modern weaponry , and simple , tried-and-tested methods for defending their fields , families , and livelihoods . Throughout these things , approach each implementation through the people . Enable them to make the technologies , processes , and knowledge their own . If they own it , and they can see its power , they'll fight tooth and nail to keep their own from misusing it . They evolve with it , tinker with it , and most importantly , they preserve it for their children . When those newly-educated children get their hands in the game , they will surpass even the people who helped their fathers build their qanats and raise the first satlinks . - - - We could have given them the greatest gifts any young civilization could receive , if we had been a little wiser and a little more discerning . Instead , we threw money at the problem , and that mostly to virtue-signal ; half in arrogance , half in misplaced guilt , entirely in self-satisfied ignorance . Africa has promise . Resources , abundant solar exposure , and countless humans with unlimited promise . If they weren't hamstrung by the warring psychopaths among them and the constant fight for the absolute basics of survival , they might do well for themselves . Injecting raw cash into various systems isn't about to change that . It's the basics , the low-level stuff that's rarely funded , that gets things done .

3047	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

3231	milliondollarextreme	Although the extent to which these intellectual and political movements influenced gentile society cannot be assessed with certainty , the material presented is highly compatible with supposing that Jewish-dominated intellectual movements were a critical factor ( necessary condition ) for the triumph of the intellectual left in late twentieth-century Western societies . No evolutionist should be surprised at the implicit theory in all this , namely , that intellectual activities of all types may at bottom involve ethnic warfare , any more than one should be surprised at the fact that political and religious ideologies typically reflect the interests of those holding them . The truly doubtful proposition for an evolutionist is whether real social science as a disinterested attempt to understand human behavior is at all possible . This does not imply that all strongly identified Jewish social scientists participated in the movements discussed in the following chapters . It implies only that Jewish identification and perceived Jewish interests were a powerful motivating force among those who led these movements and among many of their followers . These scientist-activists had very strong Jewish identities . They were very concerned with anti-Semitism and self-consciously developed theories aimed at showing that Jewish behavior was irrelevant to anti-Semitism while at same time ( in the case of psychoanalysis and the Frankfurt School ) showing that gentile ethnocentrism and participation in cohesive anti-Semitic movements were indications of psychopathology .

Followed to the letter it leads to fucking murder and oppression just flat out suffering . Not much if anything man made has caused more death and suffering than religion . People from Europe wanted to get away from the church so bad that they loaded there entire families on a boat came to the new world with their same bullshit religion and killed a bunch of God damn natives . The religion has systematically went around the world and destroyed cultures and traditions . If you follow Christianity to the letter it will lead to nothing but murder and suffering and goes against nature on almost every level . It's unfair to the people that have died throughout the centuries over this dog shit religion to just say oh some people in the church done some good . Without religion you can still do great things and good for the people but if you're a true believer in your religion and you follow it to the letter and it leads to murder in suffering much like it has throughout history then its fucking bullshit and it is evil and causes people to do evil things and has a throughout history . There is no denying it it's written in the blood of the people who died . People can be good without Christianity but following it to the letter lead you to murder and suffering . If you can tell me that following the Bible completely to the letter does not lead to suffering and murder then we will say it's not an evil force but I know you cannot say that because that would be a full blown lie because it does say that shit .

3723	politics	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : <URL> Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left .

3733	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

3879	milliondollarextreme	""" I was raised in the Catholic Church . Curious about the motivations of the scientific atheists , I bought a copy of The Origin of Species . Surely it wasn't all hate and Satan-worship . My natural Catholic reaction was to be shocked at Mr . Darwin's work , but I read it carefully and found little in it I could refute . This , I think , is where books can lead you down a rabbit hole . I began to read Friedrich Nietzsche , especially the Genealogy of Morality . He said that Christian morality now dominated the West and glorified weakness , decay , failure , martyrdom , and a mentality of slavery . I started to roll my eyes when my Catholic friends talked about the Salvation of Christ . On one occasion I even , I am ashamed to admit , very diplomatically expressed negative thoughts to my wife about the Church . "" Given the fossil record , don't you think the Genesis creation story seems a little off ? "" She was taken aback : "" Isn't that a bit ... Satanist ? "" But the indoctrination was complete . It wasn't until a few weeks later when I heard my parish priest mocking the "" fossil record "" that I realized I'd become the atheist parrot I so despised . "" Atheism is just like a cult . What am I doing ? I'm becoming a Satanist arsehole . "" I threw all of my books away and told myself outright : "" You're becoming a Satanist . What you're doing is turning you into a terrible , hateful person . "" Until that moment I hadn't even realised that "" Satanist "" was what I was becoming ; I just thought I was a more open-minded person for tolerating these views . I've spent every day since feeling shameful for being so blind and so easily coerced . It seemed so subtle - at no point did my casual and growing interest in evolution was genuine Satanism . I haven't yet told my wife that this happened , and I honestly don ’ t know how to . I need to apologize for what I said and tell her that I certainly don't believe it .

If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

4290	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT

First off , I didn't realize they had demanded that already so thank you for correcting me . Secondly , his "" negative relations with Israel "" cannot have been overblown because they have not even been mentioned : Soros ' e-mail leaks have been completely omitted or covered up by the corporate owned media . As there has been zero coverage of this story it can not possibly have been overblown nor exaggerated and it seems like you just assumed it was "" overblown "" that up to justify the next portion of your rant .

Do you have any leaked intelligence or Israeli government documents about this plan ? Or any evidence at all , because I'm very interested in reading it . As two your final two sentences , I believe them to be correct , but this is not exclusive to Israel ( although they do have a particularly ruthless intelligence and security establishment ) but is standard practice of all states and securiy organizations since the beginning of recorded history . The principle objective of any state is survival of the state and as the Palmerstonian principle goes , states have no perpetual allies or enemies , merely perpetual interests , so obviously Israel will make pacts with anyone , just like every other country , like Britain , who Lord Palmerston was referring to , or the US . US history is suffused with making pacts with literally any pro-US or anti-Soviet regime , forcing the nation to adopt the Washinon consensus , open up their markets to American corporations , draining them of their natural resources via oil / mining / agriculture corporations and then ditching them when they're of no use . Israel does have a long history of false flags against the US but you are implying that the US has no agency in its close relationship with the Israelis . There are important strategic reasons the US allied with Israel openly after the ' <NUMBER> war and used them as an offshore stabilizer in the Near East , as well as other reasons why they have maintained this relationship , which includes an important relationship between their intelligence agencies ( involving CIA hotshots like James Jesus Angleton and Ted Shackley ) . Anyway , your entire post seems predicated on the idea that states behave morally or immorally ... most people in the realist camp of international relations would argue that states are amoral in the realm of foreign policy and advancing their national interest , neither the US nor Israel deviate much from this principle ."

I can assure you that her political opponents hate being cucked by this woman for <NUMBER> years ( <NUMBER> elections ) now , but they can't come up with any better . The real problem is that Merkel is the ' mainstream conservative ' candidate but positioned herself way more on the left than her party , which can't do anything about it because she is the one who brings in the votes . So , as you can surely imagine , the ' mainstream liberals ' now need to somehow position themselves even more left than her which of course results in a retarded policy that won't be voted for anyway and our right wing ' alt-right ' style party has been picking up steam for a while but keeps fucking itself by having some actual nazis in it , which , of course , is easy prey for the establishment parties to dismiss the whole party as lunatics .

5064	uncensorednews	Syncopation is a single concept in music , and not anything relevant . You rarely see any of the concepts or musical iterations used in jazz in any classical pieces . Notation is also irrelevant in the regard of music . It's great and widely used , but being able to write music down is not a measure of greatness . Sure there are some imports , but Jazz by nature is a mix of every idea and concept in music there is and therefore superior to all other forms . It takes the best of everything , blues , world , soul , classical and others . There are great classical composers . The Newton of music may have been a classical composer , but the Einstein is a jazz musician . If classical was truly the best form of music , you wouldn't see every other genre in the world having more prolific artists than it in the present moment . The best musicians right now are Jazz artists , and the reason is that it is the most creative and deep genre in existence . It isn't even derived from Classical music as you supposed earlier . You clearly haven't studied music to any notable degree whatsoever , and all you're arguing is based off your uncultured taste . edit : I studied classical piano for <NUMBER> years , and jazz guitar for <NUMBER> , from the ages of <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> .

5283	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

5337	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

5731	sjwhate	The problem is that it's not fact . They mentioned a new book and explained how it presented some facts about different biological characteristics connected to race ; that part was true . What wasn't true were the conclusions they drew from that . They suggested some nations are poorer than others because of the racial makeup of their populations ; that is demonstrably untrue . Race doesn't affect behavioral characteristics , because behaviors are something we learn . If you left a bunch of diverse babies in a sensory deprivation chamber and didn't impart them with any parenting or knowledge , the black babies wouldn't be implicitly more violent than the white ones . The brain is plastic , especially from a young age , and a person's cultural background and upbringing are what determine their behavior as an adult . Edit : also , I'm not saying the MSM has done a good job covering issues of race with the nuance they deserve , but there is a segment of white Americans who are just flat out racist .

The lack of self-awareness in every one of these articles is cringeworthy . ___ We have a culture in decay . Feminism forces a narrative that is at odds with reality .

Millions now subscribe to a victim narrative that puts straight , white males at the top of a hierarchy of oppression , a hierarchy that includes multi-million dollar Hollywood actresses among the oppressed ! These narcissistic divas should be ashamed to frame the world in this way but our culture broadly promotes this vapid whining so there is zero self-reflection . ___ I was imagining what it would be like if an actress stood against the bullshit victim narrative . I wish I would have taken the time to write the article better , edit it for a cleaner read and explain more clearly why Emma does not suffer from the supposed pay gap .

5869	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

6049	politics	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

Conversely , Stalin and Mao both died in power at reasonably ripe old ages ; Mao at <NUMBER> and Stalin at <NUMBER> . Hitler ended his own life at <NUMBER> . What might he have done with military success and another <NUMBER> years ? and they weren't really all that much more evil than many other places Never in human history has murder been committed so efficiently and on such a scale - I'm not talking sheer numbers here but rates . Auschwitz at it's peak had no equal in history , not even close . This is the singular thing that makes the Nazis stand out from all others . They were the first to apply the principles of the industrial revolution to mass murder . Comparatively , Stalin and Mao's actions make some sense , brutal as they were . Starving the Ukraine was done to break a perceived enemy , not born of some personal or cultural hatred . The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution were not programs of intentional murder but attempts at cultural transformation , albeit with cruel indifference to the human cost , but the aims were rational . Mao and Stalin killed for gain ; the Nazis killed for spite .	EXP

6316	fatpeoplehate	I agree , it's basically the effect of cognitive dissonance + weakness / immaturity . The cognitive dissonance is getting worse thanks to HAES and FA , and then since they're too weak to own up to what they did to their own body the easiest way for them to get over the cognitive dissonance is to blame anything they can cling on to ( genetics , the patriarchy , blah blah ) . The key for them is to not be responsible for their fatness , whether through bullshit HAES , trying to change the definition of beauty , or just flat out denying reality ( I saw a post about a fat saying calories don't exist . All of my what . ) I think there are quite a few former fats here who were uninformed when they were younger / living with parents but , when slapped by reality as they got older , were strong enough emotionally / maturity wise to own up to their bad diet . Rather than extremists , i think they're all just mentally children who deny the truth , throw tantrums and act based on their fee-fees , and refuse to take responsibility for their crap . They can't bring themselves to own up to what they did to their own bodies . If you look for it in posts , it's everywhere ( bankruptcy ham , hams crying about how it's not fair that they're fat / men don't like them / their doctor is telling them things that make their fee-fees hurt , etc ) And then society coddles them and the delusion gets worse ...

6925	sjwhate	"part <NUMBER> : WHY do you care ? denying the Holocaust can easily be proven to be willful ignorance Why does it matter whether people ignorant of this , given that people are ignorant of pretty much all history ? I know the answer : Because Nazis were super evil , and we need to remember that , to stave off the threat of this ultimate evil coming back . Lack of recognition of a threat is itself a threat . This is fine and I applaud you for trying to prevent future harm . What it is implying though , is that without the Holocaust , the Nazis wouldn't appear evil or dangerous enough to stop their return . The preceding statement is either <NUMBER> . ) false , because there is plenty of evil to point at to stave off future Nazism , which means "" holocaust denial "" is actually no threat at all because the evil will still be prevented regardless of belief in holocaust . Or , <NUMBER> . ) true ... which leads to two possibilities : a . ) the holocaust did happen and there is enough evidence to prove it , in which case "" holocaust denial "" is no threat because of the dominant view on the matter which people are strongly attached to combined with the overwhelming weight of evidence preclude it from getting traction . b . ) the Holocaust DID happen but there is NOT enough evidence to prove it . That is the only scenario under which "" holocaust denial "" is a threat . To make a decent case of "" holocaust denial "" being dangerous , it is necessary to say there is not enough evidence of to prove holocaust happened ... - - - CONCLUSION / TL ;D R : If one asserts that the discussion of holocaust is not irrelevant , either "" holocaust deniers "" should be given platform , resulting in them getting crushed by the evidence , or the "" holocaust acknowledgers "" are saying they don't have proof of holocaust - - actually echoing the "" denier "" stance Therefore , the only way to not effectively support "" holocaust denial "" is to advocate for the study and discussion of "" holocaust denier's "" arguments . You might respond to that argument with something like : "" Isn't it better to still assume the holocaust happened , even if we don't have enough evidence it happened ? Just to be safe from a future hypothetical holocaust ? It doesn't cost us anything to assume it was real . "" ... It actually HAS cost us a LOT , and it is going to continue costing us . The clearest example is current day Germany . What happened was largely made possible by Germans being conditioned with guilt and self-loathing over the Holocaust . part <NUMBER> : EXTRA There's no confusion about whether or not it happened Tell me , what percentage of people who accept the narrative of Holocaust are know a a lot about it , beside some buzzword assertions like "" gas chambers "" , "" ovens "" , "" <NUMBER> million Jews murdered "" or can only cite evidence that doesn't directly corroborate the holocaust story like "" there were piles of starved-looking corpses after the war "" ? I would say over <NUMBER> % . Are those people , who are merely repeating assertions , not ALSO ignorant ? ... Now to the people who actually aren't ignorant , the historians ... Your comment sort of gave the idea of history being a finely-refined monolithic set of true statements , but of course historians do disagree on what actually happened to a degree . On a lot of things , e . g . the the great depression , they disagree more than the general public , who are like "" capitalism failed , FDR saved lol "" . Right there , you have an example of people who disagree with the mainstream narrative actually being more likely to know anything at all about the topic , and actually having looked at the evidence . But , don't all historians agree the holocaust is real ? First off , most historians focus on different parts of history so their opinion isn't worth more than that of any random person , but yes , there have been actual historians who publicly disputed parts , or the entirety , of the holocaust narrative . Those people lost their jobs and got blacklisted , some were threatened with violence and had to change their identity , some even got arrested , tried and imprisoned for it . Now , do you think that might affect the inclinations of the rest of historians to publicly question the established holocaust narrative ? Not saying they are liars , it's enough for them to avoid looking into the topic or to keep their views to themselves . part <NUMBER> : extra Nazi's themselves admit to it [ ... ] Is the Holocaust a nazi conspiracy to paint themselves as evil ? It is fine for you to believe this , given how often such claims are put forward by the professional holocaust-pushers . While anyone can say "" I'm a Nazi and holocaust was real "" , did actual Nazis admit to it ? The only person charged at Nuremberg with personally killing Jews , Ernst Kaltenbrunner , testified that he received no such orders and first heard about holocaust from foreign media . The concentration camp guards who corroborated the holocaust narrative left the Soviet interrogation rooms with their testicles destroyed . I think you'll agree those testimonies are worthless . There are no government records , or records by Third Reich officials that mention systematic mass-murder of Jews , only the removal of Jews from the Third Reich and from Europe , which was not a secret but the publicly stated policy . The confession of the "" Nazi "" arch-witness at Nuremberg , Rudolf Hoess , was acquired after <NUMBER> days of him being beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep , exposed to the elements and force-fed with alcohol . ( source : Death Dealer , Legions of Death ) Due to his state at the time , he did not remember the confession afterwards . The confession conflicts with physical evidence , e . g . he confessed to murdering <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> million people , while today the official holocaust figure for Auschwitz is <NUMBER> million . Such testimony is not admissible in a real court , but it was nevertheless used to justify his subsequent execution . part <NUMBER> : After the war , Churchill , Eisenhower and DeGaule all wrote memoirs detailing the war period . None of them mentions gas chambers or any mass extermination scheme . ... Let that sink in , what is today widely perceived as one of the most profound events in history , they decided to completely OMIT mentioning ? Why , especially as them "" Holocaust-enders "" ended up being such massive boost to their legacy ? Possible explanations : <NUMBER> ) They were secretly hardcore Nazis <NUMBER> ) The Nazis left behind a spy network that overpowered the US / UK / Israel secret services , took over the western world , and threatened them into not writing about the holocaust <NUMBER> ) Despite having encouraged the holocaust rumors at the time , they were unwilling to destroy their reputation by going on permanent record as promoters of a story that they believed would soon be exposed as a despicable lie ( it is not very nice to falsely accuse people of murder ) . part <NUMBER> : debunking supposed holocaust evidence , reviewing revisionist evidence Wasted too much time on this as it is , you can find directions to revisionist arguments and resources at the holocaust subreddit .

6928	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got !

And why she would purposely choose the date that forces the American people to make a choice between watching the final game of the series they've been watching all month , and informing themselves on the difference between the Democratic candidates ?

7408	politics	"The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited . Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

The industrial revolution and automation aren't one invention , it's a chain reaction of events and inventions building upon each other . The whole "" transitional phase "" will probably take something like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years until every single sector and industry has been transformed by the technological revolution , but most of the change will probably be done in <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years . There are a number of "" rough patches "" that are very localized . So , big plants , shutting down and a few hundreds of people get fired . Sometimes , some newer industries , and younger businesses are able to transition very rapidly and lay off a bunch of people , but most industries will go a few companies and markets at a time ( <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years as opposed to <NUMBER> + for some older , union-heavy much more established industries , think uber who can drop you in an instant and for free vs a union trucking job who have severance packages and billions of dollars invested in their current infrastructure ) . I'm not saying it's going to be unicorn la-la-land , there are people who will lose their jobs , ad there will be people who have been working <NUMBER> + years only doing one thing and they are now out of a job , and are too old to get hired and trained very easily . But , the reality is that the majority of people are going to benefit . The rich are not going to have robots making their fast food , they are going to have nice restaurants staffed with handsome waiters wearing expensive clothing because they want the "" experience "" . It's the working and middle class people that are going to benefit from how cheap shit is gonna get because of the new technologies . It's not necessary that the new jobs will require more and more training . If there is a huge supply of unskilled untrained laborers looking for work , supply and demand dictate that they will be doing something which previously did not have enough demand to justify the cost . For example , nobody will pay you , an unskilled worker $ <NUMBER> an hour to sharpen pencils . The reason is that I can make way more money paying you <NUMBER> an hour to make burgers . But , now , I have the machine making the burgers , and it would be a waste of money to pay you make the burgers . ( not relevant , but this is called the law of comparative advantage ) So , since I still want to make a profit , I'll have you sharpen the pencils or some other stupid bullshit . The only thing that you should legitimately be scared of is the minimum wage . Right now , automation technologies are getting cheaper and cheaper , and if the trend continues , the transition will be slow and industry specific , because the different technologies for the different industries will take a while to develop and that research is being done by different companies . When you raise the minimum wage from $ <NUMBER> to $ <NUMBER> , you risk making minimum wage employees more expensive than a robot , not slowly , but in one fucking day ."	EXP

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

The problem is the ideology and movement still hasn't gone . It's actually bigger than ever . The bar is simply lowering . My first SJW experience was decades ago . I was <NUMBER> and went to the shops . On the way back I went through the alley where a young adult Pakistani mugged me for my change on the way back from the <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . So I got home and told my mother what had happened . I was also angry and vented my anger saying that he was a fucking criminal scum also a fucking paki and whatever else came to mind as you do . Instead of calling the police or anything like that she couldn't care less because I had in anger said the forbidden word Paki which apparently was worse than someone threatening a kid's life for their money . Since then I've been pretty much anti-SJW through and through . It's beyond my wildest nightmares though that it has become normal for society and not merely representative of the few insane people such as my criminal apologist mother . I don't really have a problem with Pakistanis but if one threatens to stab you then you can go figure calling him names shortly after the incident might be the kind of thing that one would naturally be expected to do .

7884	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

( WTHR ) - A Brown County church vandalized with Donald Trump graffiti shortly after the <NUMBER> election wasn't targeted by pro-Trump political activists , but a member of their own congregation , according to police . People suspected the KKK or some other hate group was responsible for the graffiti . The arrest of the church organist , was a surprise - and a relief . The Brown County prosecuting attorney's office issued a statement Wednesday saying they had charged <NUMBER> - year-old George Nathaniel Stang of Bloominon with institutional criminal mischief , a misdemeanor . Stang was the man who originally claimed to have found the graffiti , and works as the organist at St . David's Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom . "" Oh my , the organist , "" Mary Ayers said . "" The organist . Wow . Wow . "" It was November , shortly after the presidential election . Stang told everyone he discovered the graffiti when he arrived for Sunday morning services . The small Episcopal church is inclusive and welcomes gay couples . RELATED : Brown County church vandalized Detectives immediately suspected the crime was committed by someone familiar with the church . They said cell phone records put Stang in the area Saturday night . According to court records , when confronted with the evidence , the <NUMBER> - year-old gay man confessed . Investigators say Stang admitted to painting the "" Heil Trump "" and "" Fag Church "" graffiti himself because he wanted to "" mobilize a movement after being disappointed in and fearful of the outcome of the national election . "" He insisted his actions were not motivated by anti-Christian or anti-gay sentiments . Ron Smith , a Brown county resident , shook his head . "" Is there any rhyme or reason or sanity in any of this action ? "" Eyewitness News asked . "" I don't think , "" Smith said . Brown County Prosecutor Ted Adams talked about Stang's alleged motive . "" He explained that one of the reasons he had done it was because of fear . He was concerned about the results of the election , "" Adams said . In a three-page , handwritten statement , Stang , according to court records , wanted to "" mobilize a movement . "" "" I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good , even if it was a false flag , "" he wrote . "" To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation . I of course realize now , this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism . "" The hate crime hurt the community . Residents say it gave outsiders the wrong impression of Bean Blossom . Jody Boyd is relieved the mystery is apparently solved . "" Just knowing the hate crimes will be stopped here in Brown County , maybe things will be put to rest , "" Boyd said . If convicted , Stang could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined as much as $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> . Reached by phone Wednesday , he had nothing to say . The church had no comment on the arrest , but Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis Bishop Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows issued the following statement about the vandalism : I was saddened to learn this morning that the vandalism of St . David ’ s Church in Bean Blossom was committed by the church ’ s organist , Nathan Stang , who has admitted to police that he spray painted hateful graffiti on the church last November in the wake of the presidential election . This was a hurtful , dishonest , and profoundly misguided action that stands against the values of the people of this diocese and the Episcopal Church , and we will continue to cooperate with the authorities who are pursuing this case ."

8207	europeannationalism	I am from an Eastern Europeean country where the problem with migrants and refugees is not that major yet . However , this certainly does not mean that we shouldn't do anything , especially considering the state of the Western World . Most people in the country absolutely despise Muslim migrants , gypsies ( since there are many of them here ) and , of course , we are not big fans of Islam in general . However , most right-wing organizations in our country are just skinheads who have nothing new to offer , and they are simply promoting the same ideas - race war now , kill all shitskins , etc . This does not attract new followers , nor does it change anything ( apart from the fact that they beat up gypsies on a regular basis ) . This is why we decided to form a new organization which features primarily people from our country , but we are also attracting members from outside of our nation . Last month we met a Dutch guy who came across our stickers in the streets and joined our Discord channel , and in a few weeks we are meeting a guy from the U . S . who's going on an European trip and decided to visit our city after he had a chat with us . While most of the founders of our project share the far-right believes of the skinheads in our country , we realize that this is not the way to attract more people on our side . That's why we are taking a more subtle approach that will allow us to have conversations with ' regular people ' who are still uncertain whether they should lean to the left or right side of things . Apart from the stickers we are distributing around the city , we also make sure to clean up our streets from any leftist stickers , art , etc . We also may or may not take care of some Jewish monuments , portraits of Che , ( ( ( Marx ) ) ) , etc . These is the first batch of stickers we ordered - <URL> These are the translated variants , the ones we put up on the streets are in Cyrillic , but we'll also order an English batch to pair with them . As you can see , the stickers are not that harsh , and we are hoping that this will attract the attention of not just the far-right people , but of the ' average person ' . One of the guys in our organizations also provided us with some less-friendly stickers that we are distributing , but not associating our name with . We thought people like us were needed because as of recent years , more and more go to some of the Western countries for their bachelor's degree , and they end up being brainwashed into believing the liberal ideas . We hope that our presence will at least slightly reduce the number of people who end up falling for the white genocide propaganda being pushed in our faces on a daily basis .	EXP

8220	Christianity	I'm fine with the way it is now . Children can pray in public school , if it's done silently and not teacher-led . That's the way it should be , in my opinion . It's the only fair way to do it in a secular nation full of people of different religions as well as atheists . If you're OK with teacher-led prayer in public schools , is that only because you assume it's going to be Christian ? Or would you be bothered if it was a teacher-led Muslim prayer ? Or Hindu prayer ? Or Wiccan ? Granted , in private schools , children can pray out loud and have it be teacher-led . So , if you want your kid to be able to experience teacher-led prayer , send them to private school ... As it stands now , no one is barring kids from praying silently in class , to themselves . I think that's the way it should be .	NOT

I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people . Either way , i don't have anything keeping me here . Thank the gods for Reddit . Where's your mom from ? While i agree that some things are ... i dunno what the word is ... more abundant here , i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer . And frankly , i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living . Not retail at least . If i had my own farm , okay , i could see it . But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit . I might can fool myself sometimes like today , but it was because i actually did something at work and not because i handled customers . ( re-organized some shit that needed it badly ) I dunno . I am frustrated . I want a simpler life is all , and you can't achieve that here . Or it is very difficult and usually requires waiting till retirement . boy i'm negative rolling into the new year =P	NOT

9112	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

9158	leagueoflegends	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight . The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities . Most players don't recognize when the game is tipped in their favor ( IE someone on the enemy team got caught and died ) and fail to make moves on towers and neutral monsters when the enemy team either cannot respond or would be at significant disadvantage in doing so . Bad players , when in the <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> advantage , will opt to continue farming , wander aimlessly looking for farm , or B + shop at substantial health . Here's some example logic in which a team has <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> advantage and should opt to take dragon / baron or push towers , in that order . DISCLAIMER : This is very general . The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron . The exceptions to this line of logic occur most often when your team has been feeding and enemies cannot be dealt with even 5v4 . - - - GUIDE - - - Hau <NUMBER> Taek Neutral Dagrons after 10mins ( or 20mins for Baron Dagron ) - - - - IF - The number of people dead on their team number of people dead on your team - THEN - group & move immediately to a dagron . - IF - enemy doesn't respond by also immediately moving to a dagron - THEN - begin fighting dagron . - IF - enemy moves in during your dagron killings - AND - team is still in good health - THEN - engage enemy for an easy teamfight win and extended time in the advantage . - OTHERWISE - back out and let them try to take it .

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

9992	sjwhate	I think a far right comic would be a little boring TBH . When the far right is already pretty much winning in every other arena ( news , politics , zeitgeist ) , it's kind of redundant . I see Alt-Hero becoming a middle-of-road comic with nods to certain far-right topics like anti-PC and nationalism over globalism . Being in the middle gives them a lot more room for certain storylines and character development , so I think it could be a good thing . Given the people involved , it's pretty safe it at least won't veer left of center at all . Artwork already looks better if you look at some of the latest shading . Can still use some work , but it's getting there . My hope is this will be viable for long-term and also give other non-leftist voices encouragement to succeed in similar industries that have been taken over by SJW .

10216	uncensorednews	Quaestores was the name given to people that practiced the unrestricted sale of indulgences . No , it wasn't . The quaestores were lay officers who were charged with handling the quaestua , the collection of alms . Because , as was typical of Medieval offices , the quaestores provided for themselves from the activity they were charged with , many became greed profiteers , a problem exacerbated by the fact that Catholic rulers used quaestores under their control to divert a portion of the quaestua for their own uses . The Countil of Trent sought to fix this problem by abolishing the lay quaestores and shifting the duty of quaestua to canons only , which would automatically prevent the institutionalized profiteering by both removing the ability for rulers to exploit the quaestua as well as preventing the alms collectors from taking a portion of the alms for themselves .

10336	uncensorednews	Im on mobile so im not able to articulate my thoughts as much , but im going to do my best here . Im following you on pretty much all of your main points but where you lost me is where you mentioned using the word racist is a non-argument . I counter this by the fact that racism is defined by the use of racial slurs and sterotypes , so by my saying you are racist I am arguing that you fit into this category of people who act in this manner . I certainly dont think im more right than you , but by calling you a racist ( referring to your example ) im showing you that im taking a stance opposite to you , defined by my use of the word to separate my views from yours . ( Again in the exmaple because I dont know all of your ideas / views ) Surpirsingly enough I agree with much of what you said , but I disagree that my use of a certain word makes my argument invalid . I could have just as easily laid out a detailed rebuttal of why I believe you are racist , but I instead chose to use that specific word because by definition it supports my argument to do so . On the flip side I also see how there is a very thin line between arguing that someone is a racist , and using the word as a cop out as you put it . In the future ill make sure not to rely on the word alone to support my ideas , but I will continue to use it in discussion because I believe it does support those views .	IMP

10825	fatpeoplehate	Hey - this is wrong . That's the force acting on them as they go down - try converting the potential to kinetic , because absorbed energy at impact is what will hurt . Treat them as a COM like you did in this , then convert their potential energy to kinetic at ground level - remember their gut holds them about a foot off the ground . Also , this assumes that all their energy goes back into themselves as they drop like dead weight - no energy lost to friction with stumbling . Finally , this extra energy is in fact dispersed in the giant volumes of low density material that they are coated in - so , yes , shitlords are less likely to survive a fall from any height . Tall enough falls , end the fatass would have a lower terminal velocity to boot . CAVEAT : this is treating both bodies as points of mass that drop like dead weight straight down , or simply rotate like a pivot around their feet like in your estimation ( comes out to the same thing btw energywise ) . IRL , from small distances at least , a shitlord would be less encumbered in trying to catch themselves , and would be thus less injured because he energy would go into their joints like it should .

I wasn't ignoring that I must have failed in being clear , but I was trying to say that before we can talk about hydrocyanic gas concentrations , the pellets have to slowly evaporate until the deadly concentration is reached . According to the story , there was only 20minutes until everyone died from inhaling the deadly gas at high enough of a concentration to kill . I contend that it would have taken much longer than 20minutes to reach that concentration in such a huge and cold room . I don't know if you've seen the pictures of camp survivors but I'd be surprised if most people weighed over <NUMBER> kg and would require a smaller concentration to kill .

They look nothing like the Typhus ridden skeletons that are usually shown as "" victims of Hitler "" . ( picture of child suffering from typhoid fever in south africa - <URL> / media / File : LizzieVanZyl.jpg ) Secondly there are multiple sources I've found that has chambers could be heated to facilitate gas release from pellets / discs This is true ... for the delousing facilities . They had a special machine that heated the pellets and fanned the gas throughout the room ( pictures of such device <URL> But this is not what is alleged for the killing operation and none of the witnesses or sonderkommandos attest to the morgues being heated . The pellets of Zyklon are just dropped in overhead . I also never said that it took <NUMBER> hours for the gas to be released . My bad . I thought you were referring to the fact that outside of Auschwitz , in places were vermin were killed with Zyklon B , like on ships , they would leave the premises for <NUMBER> - 48hours for the gas to fully evaporate and dissipate . My point was just that once the Zyklon was dropped into the morgue , it would take many hours before the liquid was fully evaporated . No amount of fanning would make this a quick procedure especially since after killing <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> people , the zyklon would be trapped underneath a bunch of bodies . It would continually give off poison gas and would surely kill anyone coming into the morgue to remove the bodies . edit : I did some reading on the heating of morgue I of Krema II and found this in Jean Claude Pressac's book : <URL> ( you can find the book in pdf format in the sidebar of this sub ) JCP talks about some order that was never found that supposedly mentioned heating the morgues to cause a quick death , he gives this big explanation but concludes by saying that a fire was started and thus the whole plan was scrapped Therefore the morgues were not preheated . If you want to believe the people who call themselves witnesses , then it makes sense that they would not have reported pre-heated morgues in their testimonies . So we are to believe that the Zyklon B pellets filled with liquid HCN evaporated and reached the deadly concentration in a cold underground room within 20minutes ( much less really since it would take time between inhalation and death ) . What you need to picture is a glass of water being put in a room .

This explains precisely the problem with MOST people our age . You may think it's both peoples fault , father and mother equally , but I'm not saying everything I'm saying FROM HATRED OF WOMEN , that's absolutely not the source of it , try to listen to me here , I'm just OBSERVING WHAT IS GOING ON my emotions over the issue are irrelevant , I'm simply stating the facts as I see them . We can talk about guys being shitty fathers , leaving the woman with a child in her arms , but from what i can see , he's going to get fucked and she's going to be ok because he loses rights to custody and she gets a free bonus check , so why would a guy want to do that ? I've known plenty of guys that actively wanted to be a part of their child's life , however , yet were denied the opportunity and abused like an old tool into giving what they can't to someone they end up hating all for the sake of a child they will not even know , and a lot of the time some other guy gets called daddy . I'm not making this shit up , that's the system When have you ever heard of women paying child support to a stay at home dad ? it happens but it's like finding a unicorn . Women paying alimony ? fat chance that a woman would marry a guy below her salary to begin with . Single fathers are rare enough and when they exist a lot of times it's because the mother passed away in an accident or child birth or whatever else , sometimes women leave the man with a kid my brother in law had that happen to him but honestly other than in meth or black communities where women turn into junkies where does that happen . And my own disappointment in my mom is real but doesn't inform anything I'm saying , I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't recognize that it's as widespread as it is , my mom is a good example though , just another statistic in the USA where the nuclear family is now a minority , broken homes , divorce , single parenthood are now the norm . And as I said before , the woman decides when the family gets created . Before that child is born , it's all hunky dory , but bringing a child into the world that was created by a piece of shit thug or deadbeat loser , or conversely having a child and crushing the father with the system out of spite as so many women have done - again look at family court - is not a recipe for a strong society , and women again have total control over these things . You may not long for the life of a single mother and that honestly is a mark of your intelligence but let's be real , a lot of dumb girls especially in their teens and in poorly educated families get their hormones going and literally try to have children at young ages , they know they can resort to the Government if their boyfriend dips out , who is just a dumb kid like them , I've said before an older man will typically step up to bat and be a father , younger guys especially without father figures are more selfish than men who were instilled with dignity and honor , I mean I grew up in a <NUMBER> % white community and I still got to see dozens and dozens of girls get pregnant at my high school and end up dropping out , and plenty of guys I know were the unlucky dads who had a falling out with them and you guessed it - got half their $ <NUMBER> or so monthly income working during or after high school taken away . I know a guy that was paying $ <NUMBER> a month , and he had to bust his ass for <NUMBER> hours a week to make it . You may not believe in the wage gap , I've seen it first hand , most guys I knew growing up worked full time in high school , overtime , <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hour weeks , a lot of girls didn't even work and when they did it was part time at some mcjob while they sat pretty driving their daddy's car .

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers .

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear .

That being said , most people here don't really care beyond "" lol america "" , passively thinking Trump is some bigot , but without any of the emotional vigor that has poisoned the U . S .. Furthermore , ( like in the states ) , anyone with a brain that thinks for themselves beyond what the headlines tell them realizes the absurd exaggeration that has been going on . I'm honestly surprised that I've met more open-minded people here who had already reached this conclusion themselves or were at least considerate of it without bias than back when I was in America . I think that just has to do with people being more impartial because it's not their country or leader or whatever . This election has been such a disappointment to me in the way so many people I once respected have placed their judgements on Trump , fundamentally showing they've lost any semblance of having common sense and an ability to think critically and independently . I don't even really agree with a lot of republican principles in a matter of policy , but the hypocrisy from the media , pundits , and various celebrities-turned-activist that his incurred in the last year has swayed me away from ever wanting to identify as a democrat in the future .

However a closer inspection by the medical community reveals that people don't really ' OD ' on cocaine but have long term cardiac disease , similar to fried chicken . The majority of deaths in the cocaine trade , by FAR , is violence between drug sellers . Heroin is a horrible evil addiction and overdosing is a real possibility . However many overdoses occur because of the wide spectrum of potency . Some heroin is so supplemented with other ( dangerous ) stuff that the user barely gets high ; and some is so powerful it will kill the user . Not knowing the potency of the drug is what leads to many overdoses . There are also the many longer term health effects of intravenous heroin use , often caused by sharing needles and using poor venipunture technique . A heroin user with a steady supply of consistent heroin who uses good aseptic technique can live a long time ( William Burroughs ) , not that that seems like a happy life .

Its illegal to be racist as a white person and we are constantly harassed and being breeded to extinction by multiple western governments that hate their own people . This is the worst time in recorded history for white people to exist . Little hope is on the horizon , for us , aside from a gruesome , bloodbath of an inevitable race war because their is no halting of the brakes and the west never ends the relentless mental drones strikes on the mind of the white people .

If the race war begins , do you actually think white people will get what they want , from their demands ? The SJW's will not allow us .

11916	uncensorednews	I'll tell you why . The bible is a collection of stories about god and that's how Christians perceive it , so there's a lot of room for cherry picking and fitting it somehow into western society . The Quran is thought to be THE word of god and that's how Muslims perceive it . It's difficult to cherry pick the verses you like and disregard the ones you don't . You either take it all or leave it all . That was the sort of moral dilemma I was trapped into when I was a Muslim . There were a lot of verses in the Quran that I didn't agree with and I tried so hard to interpret them in a way that makes them have a somewhat good meaning that is compatible with modern human values , but being a native speaker of Arabic who understood exactly what the verses meant in a literal sense , I felt that I was being disingenuous and I stopped lying to myself not long after that . I don't think the effort to modernize Islam is going to be very fruitful , not until Muslims admit that the Quran is not actually perfect in anyway and couldn't have been written by god ( assuming that he exists ) , which is not easy .

11958	uncensorednews	if he were preaching against homosexuality he was also not preaching the word of Jesus . Jesus said a grand total of exactly nothing for or against homosexuality . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus didn't have to say anything about homosexuality . The reason is because no first-century Jew ever had any question as to whether homosexual behavior was morally permissible or not . They all knew that it was condemned . Why ? Because every reference to sex and marriage in the Old Testament , every poem , and every metaphor presumes heterosexual sex and heterosexual marriage . Every reference to homosexuality in the Old Testament was negative . So , there's no question as to what Jews and other people who were listening to Jesus at the time that he was speaking would have thought about the question of homosexuality . There was no need for him to address it . - <NUMBER> ) Even if it turns out that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality , what follows from that ? Nothing . Even if Jesus never said anything about it , it doesn't mean that he therefore thinks that it's morally permissible to engage in homosexual sex . This would be simply an argument from silence . After all , Jesus never said anything about drunkenness , child sacrifice , or neglecting the elderly , but clearly we wouldn't say that Jesus thinks that those things are morally permissible . It's quite possible that he never said anything about it , but that does not mean that therefore he thinks that homosexuality is okay . - <NUMBER> ) It's not certain that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality . It's quite possible that he did say something about homosexuality but that it wasn't recorded by the gospel authors . After all , the gospel writers didn't put down everything that Jesus said , only the things that they deemed relevant to their audiences . In fact , in John <NUMBER> the gospel writer says , “ and Jesus did many other things that if they were written in books there would be so many books we couldn't even fit them in the world . ” In other words , there are lots of things that Jesus said and did that weren't documented . It's quite possible that Jesus did say something about homosexuality but because it wasn't really a hot-button issue of the day , the gospel writers didn ’ t include it in the gospel accounts . - <NUMBER> ) We do know what Jesus would have said about homosexuality if he were asked . Why ? Because Jesus was an observant Jew , and as an observant Jew , he upheld the Law of Moses . In fact , many times when he was in conversations with people , he would reference the Mosaic Law . He would say the greatest commandment , “ Love your God with all your heart , soul , strenh , and mind , and love your neighbor as yourself . ” When the Jews were talking to Jesus about marriage and divorce , he even said , “ What did Moses teach you in the law ? ” So he would often uphold the Law of Moses because it was still binding . Therefore , if Jesus was asked , “ What do you think about homosexuality ? ” We know what he would say . He would have simply cited the Levitical prohibitions in Leviticus <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , which clearly teach that homosexuality is sin . So again , even if he was asked , we know what he would have said . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus does voice his opinion on matters of sex and marriage . When Jesus is answering a question about divorce in Matthew <NUMBER> , Jesus cites the creation account where it says that a man will leave his parents and be united to his wife and they shall become one flesh . Notice , Jesus ' view of sex and marriage is one man , with one woman , becoming one flesh , for one lifetime . Then Jesus says , “ What God has ordained , let no man separate . ” What God has brought together , let no man separate . In other words , God Himself is ordaining this heterosexual union of man and wife . So , if Jesus ’ view on sex and marriage is for one man and one woman to come together in a heterosexual union , then this would automatically disqualify all other forms of sex and all other forms of marriage . That would include fornication , adultery , and of course even homosexuality . In other words , by Jesus taking a stance on what sex and marriage is about , heterosexually speaking , then therefore , this disqualifies all other forms of sexual behavior , including homosexuality . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus does basically say that homosexuality is a sin , and we see this in Mark <NUMBER> where Jesus is talking about what makes a man unclean and what defiles a man . He says that it's from within a man's heart and what comes out of it that ultimately makes a man unclean . He says sexual immorality , theft , murder , and a whole bunch of other things . The Greek word that's used for sexual immorality is “ porneia , ” and that Greek word is a reference to sexual sins of which homosexuality would be included . No first-century Jew would hear the word “ porneia ” and not automatically think that Jesus is making reference to the sexual sins that are listed in Leviticus <NUMBER> and Leviticus <NUMBER> . - <NUMBER> ) Saying that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality presumes that the words of Jesus are somehow more authoritative than the words of Scripture elsewhere . It's the Holy Spirit , God Himself , who has inspired all the words of Scripture , not just the red letters . Of course , that would include passages like Leviticus <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , Romans <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> Corinthians <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> Timothy <NUMBER> where Scripture clearly condemns homosexual sex and says it ’ s not morally permissible . Since Jesus and the Holy Spirit are part of the Trinity , they have been living in perfect holy communion for all eternity past . Chances are , Jesus and the Holy Spirit agree with each other . Therefore , Jesus ’ view would be the same as the Holy Spirit ’ s view who inspired all of Scripture of where we see many passages that clearly condemn homosexual behavior . Any one of those seven responses is sufficient to respond to this challenge , but when you combine all seven of them together , it leaves no possibility for sustaining the idea that just because Jesus never said anything about homosexuality in the Bible , therefore Jesus is ok with homosexual behavior . He's not . - [ source ] ( <URL>	EXP
