78	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

That being said , most people here don't really care beyond "" lol america "" , passively thinking Trump is some bigot , but without any of the emotional vigor that has poisoned the U . S .. Furthermore , ( like in the states ) , anyone with a brain that thinks for themselves beyond what the headlines tell them realizes the absurd exaggeration that has been going on . I'm honestly surprised that I've met more open-minded people here who had already reached this conclusion themselves or were at least considerate of it without bias than back when I was in America . I think that just has to do with people being more impartial because it's not their country or leader or whatever . This election has been such a disappointment to me in the way so many people I once respected have placed their judgements on Trump , fundamentally showing they've lost any semblance of having common sense and an ability to think critically and independently . I don't even really agree with a lot of republican principles in a matter of policy , but the hypocrisy from the media , pundits , and various celebrities-turned-activist that his incurred in the last year has swayed me away from ever wanting to identify as a democrat in the future .

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

637	milliondollarextreme	Nature worship is natural enough while the society is young , or , in other words , Pantheism is all right as long as it is the worship of Pan . But Nature has another side which experience and sin are not slow in finding out , and it is no flippancy to say of the god Pan that he soon showed the cloven hoof . The only objection to Natural Religion is that somehow it always becomes unnatural . A man loves Nature in the morning for her innocence and amiability , and at nightfall , if he is loving her still , it is for her darkness and her cruelty . He washes at dawn in clear water as did the Wise Man of the Stoics , yet , somehow at the dark end of the day , he is bathing in hot bull's blood , as did Julian the Apostate . The mere pursuit of health always leads to something unhealthy . Physical nature must not be made the direct object of obedience ; it must be enjoyed , not worshipped . Stars and mountains must not be taken seriously . If they are , we end where the pagan nature worship ended . Because the earth is kind , we can imitate all her cruelties .

921	explainlikeimfive	, has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big . Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts .

943	uncensorednews	This points to an even worse problem : we took a massive amount of resources that could have made Africa a self-sufficient , competing nation national block with a high standard of living and we mismanaged almost every penny . Same for all sorts of foreign aid . I understand the impulse to help , but you need to start from first principles with these things . You can't just chuck money and tech into a society ; then it isn't theirs , and it gets misused or squandered . Start with the culture . What do they value ? How do you communicate ? How do they see their world and evaluate their quality of life ? Now , apply that to education . Don't just build schools , make sure kids can get to them . Make sure the teaching is effective , and give the kids easy access to information of all sorts for self-directed learning . Make sure it's communicated in a way that they can value within the scope of their own culture and experience . Next , set up small financial institutions . Design systems with existing , low-tech solutions to enable the flow of credit and debit . Raise small , family-owned institutions to do things like microcrediting and agricultural co-ops . Again , understanding the culture and social fabric is key to making this work . Who loans to whom , and for what reasons ? Are there certain protocols for settling financial disputes ? Make sure you marry that into the system , or at least put up some kind of interface to weld them together . Otherwise , in the best-case scenario , nobody uses it . At the same time , work with local farmers , elders , and craftspeople to develop more efficient agriculture and transport infrastructure for goods . Listen to the locals here , because they know the land better than you . Take that and mix it with a heavy dose of ecological engineering and sustainable techniques , the lower-tech the better . Toss the result to the kids and the local makers ; I've seen some truly brilliant solutions come out of that last step before implementation . Never underestimate a curious kid or a resourceful scrap metal artist . Finally , empower the populace to protect themselves from predation . Train them in basic self-defense , how to counter modern weaponry , and simple , tried-and-tested methods for defending their fields , families , and livelihoods . Throughout these things , approach each implementation through the people . Enable them to make the technologies , processes , and knowledge their own . If they own it , and they can see its power , they'll fight tooth and nail to keep their own from misusing it . They evolve with it , tinker with it , and most importantly , they preserve it for their children . When those newly-educated children get their hands in the game , they will surpass even the people who helped their fathers build their qanats and raise the first satlinks . - - - We could have given them the greatest gifts any young civilization could receive , if we had been a little wiser and a little more discerning . Instead , we threw money at the problem , and that mostly to virtue-signal ; half in arrogance , half in misplaced guilt , entirely in self-satisfied ignorance . Africa has promise . Resources , abundant solar exposure , and countless humans with unlimited promise . If they weren't hamstrung by the warring psychopaths among them and the constant fight for the absolute basics of survival , they might do well for themselves . Injecting raw cash into various systems isn't about to change that . It's the basics , the low-level stuff that's rarely funded , that gets things done . We meant well , but I wish we would have done better .	EXP

974	milliondollarextreme	""" I was raised in the Catholic Church . Curious about the motivations of the scientific atheists , I bought a copy of The Origin of Species . Surely it wasn't all hate and Satan-worship . My natural Catholic reaction was to be shocked at Mr . Darwin's work , but I read it carefully and found little in it I could refute . This , I think , is where books can lead you down a rabbit hole . I began to read Friedrich Nietzsche , especially the Genealogy of Morality . He said that Christian morality now dominated the West and glorified weakness , decay , failure , martyrdom , and a mentality of slavery . I started to roll my eyes when my Catholic friends talked about the Salvation of Christ . On one occasion I even , I am ashamed to admit , very diplomatically expressed negative thoughts to my wife about the Church . "" Given the fossil record , don't you think the Genesis creation story seems a little off ? "" She was taken aback : "" Isn't that a bit ... Satanist ? "" But the indoctrination was complete . It wasn't until a few weeks later when I heard my parish priest mocking the "" fossil record "" that I realized I'd become the atheist parrot I so despised . "" Atheism is just like a cult . What am I doing ? I'm becoming a Satanist arsehole . "" I threw all of my books away and told myself outright : "" You're becoming a Satanist . What you're doing is turning you into a terrible , hateful person . "" Until that moment I hadn't even realised that "" Satanist "" was what I was becoming ; I just thought I was a more open-minded person for tolerating these views . I've spent every day since feeling shameful for being so blind and so easily coerced . It seemed so subtle - at no point did my casual and growing interest in evolution was genuine Satanism . I haven't yet told my wife that this happened , and I honestly don ’ t know how to . I need to apologize for what I said and tell her that I certainly don't believe it . It is going to be a tough conversation and I'm not looking forward to it . I didn't think this could happen to me . But it did and it will haunt me for a long time to come ."	EXP

1096	uncensorednews	if he were preaching against homosexuality he was also not preaching the word of Jesus . Jesus said a grand total of exactly nothing for or against homosexuality . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus didn't have to say anything about homosexuality . The reason is because no first-century Jew ever had any question as to whether homosexual behavior was morally permissible or not . They all knew that it was condemned . Why ? Because every reference to sex and marriage in the Old Testament , every poem , and every metaphor presumes heterosexual sex and heterosexual marriage . Every reference to homosexuality in the Old Testament was negative . So , there's no question as to what Jews and other people who were listening to Jesus at the time that he was speaking would have thought about the question of homosexuality . There was no need for him to address it . - <NUMBER> ) Even if it turns out that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality , what follows from that ? Nothing . Even if Jesus never said anything about it , it doesn't mean that he therefore thinks that it's morally permissible to engage in homosexual sex . This would be simply an argument from silence . After all , Jesus never said anything about drunkenness , child sacrifice , or neglecting the elderly , but clearly we wouldn't say that Jesus thinks that those things are morally permissible . It's quite possible that he never said anything about it , but that does not mean that therefore he thinks that homosexuality is okay . - <NUMBER> ) It's not certain that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality . It's quite possible that he did say something about homosexuality but that it wasn't recorded by the gospel authors . After all , the gospel writers didn't put down everything that Jesus said , only the things that they deemed relevant to their audiences . In fact , in John <NUMBER> the gospel writer says , “ and Jesus did many other things that if they were written in books there would be so many books we couldn't even fit them in the world . ” In other words , there are lots of things that Jesus said and did that weren't documented . It's quite possible that Jesus did say something about homosexuality but because it wasn't really a hot-button issue of the day , the gospel writers didn ’ t include it in the gospel accounts . - <NUMBER> ) We do know what Jesus would have said about homosexuality if he were asked . Why ? Because Jesus was an observant Jew , and as an observant Jew , he upheld the Law of Moses . In fact , many times when he was in conversations with people , he would reference the Mosaic Law . He would say the greatest commandment , “ Love your God with all your heart , soul , strenh , and mind , and love your neighbor as yourself . ” When the Jews were talking to Jesus about marriage and divorce , he even said , “ What did Moses teach you in the law ? ” So he would often uphold the Law of Moses because it was still binding . Therefore , if Jesus was asked , “ What do you think about homosexuality ? ” We know what he would say . He would have simply cited the Levitical prohibitions in Leviticus <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , which clearly teach that homosexuality is sin . So again , even if he was asked , we know what he would have said . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus does voice his opinion on matters of sex and marriage . When Jesus is answering a question about divorce in Matthew <NUMBER> , Jesus cites the creation account where it says that a man will leave his parents and be united to his wife and they shall become one flesh . Notice , Jesus ' view of sex and marriage is one man , with one woman , becoming one flesh , for one lifetime . Then Jesus says , “ What God has ordained , let no man separate . ” What God has brought together , let no man separate . In other words , God Himself is ordaining this heterosexual union of man and wife . So , if Jesus ’ view on sex and marriage is for one man and one woman to come together in a heterosexual union , then this would automatically disqualify all other forms of sex and all other forms of marriage . That would include fornication , adultery , and of course even homosexuality . In other words , by Jesus taking a stance on what sex and marriage is about , heterosexually speaking , then therefore , this disqualifies all other forms of sexual behavior , including homosexuality . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus does basically say that homosexuality is a sin , and we see this in Mark <NUMBER> where Jesus is talking about what makes a man unclean and what defiles a man . He says that it's from within a man's heart and what comes out of it that ultimately makes a man unclean . He says sexual immorality , theft , murder , and a whole bunch of other things . The Greek word that's used for sexual immorality is “ porneia , ” and that Greek word is a reference to sexual sins of which homosexuality would be included . No first-century Jew would hear the word “ porneia ” and not automatically think that Jesus is making reference to the sexual sins that are listed in Leviticus <NUMBER> and Leviticus <NUMBER> . - <NUMBER> ) Saying that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality presumes that the words of Jesus are somehow more authoritative than the words of Scripture elsewhere . It's the Holy Spirit , God Himself , who has inspired all the words of Scripture , not just the red letters . Of course , that would include passages like Leviticus <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , Romans <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> Corinthians <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> Timothy <NUMBER> where Scripture clearly condemns homosexual sex and says it ’ s not morally permissible . Since Jesus and the Holy Spirit are part of the Trinity , they have been living in perfect holy communion for all eternity past . Chances are , Jesus and the Holy Spirit agree with each other . Therefore , Jesus ’ view would be the same as the Holy Spirit ’ s view who inspired all of Scripture of where we see many passages that clearly condemn homosexual behavior . Any one of those seven responses is sufficient to respond to this challenge , but when you combine all seven of them together , it leaves no possibility for sustaining the idea that just because Jesus never said anything about homosexuality in the Bible , therefore Jesus is ok with homosexual behavior .

If you think you are getting welfare , Unemployment Insurance or free health care without the required government ID you are shit out of luck . - I don't want jobs to be taken from Canadians but honestly a little downward pressure on the price of trades would not be a bad thing .

EDIT : The above applies only to bosses , not leaders , as shown in [ this here graphic ] ( <URL> If you work at a small business where the owner is "" first among equals "" , the likelihood of their lying to you decreases significantly . Finally , if a politician's lips are moving , they are lying .

Followed to the letter it leads to fucking murder and oppression just flat out suffering . Not much if anything man made has caused more death and suffering than religion . People from Europe wanted to get away from the church so bad that they loaded there entire families on a boat came to the new world with their same bullshit religion and killed a bunch of God damn natives . The religion has systematically went around the world and destroyed cultures and traditions . If you follow Christianity to the letter it will lead to nothing but murder and suffering and goes against nature on almost every level . It's unfair to the people that have died throughout the centuries over this dog shit religion to just say oh some people in the church done some good . Without religion you can still do great things and good for the people but if you're a true believer in your religion and you follow it to the letter and it leads to murder in suffering much like it has throughout history then its fucking bullshit and it is evil and causes people to do evil things and has a throughout history . There is no denying it it's written in the blood of the people who died . People can be good without Christianity but following it to the letter lead you to murder and suffering . If you can tell me that following the Bible completely to the letter does not lead to suffering and murder then we will say it's not an evil force but I know you cannot say that because that would be a full blown lie because it does say that shit .

1944	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

1991	uncensorednews	"BEAN BLOSSOM , Ind . ( WTHR ) - A Brown County church vandalized with Donald Trump graffiti shortly after the <NUMBER> election wasn't targeted by pro-Trump political activists , but a member of their own congregation , according to police . People suspected the KKK or some other hate group was responsible for the graffiti . The arrest of the church organist , was a surprise - and a relief . The Brown County prosecuting attorney's office issued a statement Wednesday saying they had charged <NUMBER> - year-old George Nathaniel Stang of Bloominon with institutional criminal mischief , a misdemeanor . Stang was the man who originally claimed to have found the graffiti , and works as the organist at St . David's Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom . "" Oh my , the organist , "" Mary Ayers said . "" The organist . Wow . Wow . "" It was November , shortly after the presidential election . Stang told everyone he discovered the graffiti when he arrived for Sunday morning services . The small Episcopal church is inclusive and welcomes gay couples . RELATED : Brown County church vandalized Detectives immediately suspected the crime was committed by someone familiar with the church . They said cell phone records put Stang in the area Saturday night . According to court records , when confronted with the evidence , the <NUMBER> - year-old gay man confessed . Investigators say Stang admitted to painting the "" Heil Trump "" and "" Fag Church "" graffiti himself because he wanted to "" mobilize a movement after being disappointed in and fearful of the outcome of the national election . "" He insisted his actions were not motivated by anti-Christian or anti-gay sentiments . Ron Smith , a Brown county resident , shook his head . "" Is there any rhyme or reason or sanity in any of this action ? "" Eyewitness News asked . "" I don't think , "" Smith said . Brown County Prosecutor Ted Adams talked about Stang's alleged motive . "" He explained that one of the reasons he had done it was because of fear . He was concerned about the results of the election , "" Adams said . In a three-page , handwritten statement , Stang , according to court records , wanted to "" mobilize a movement . "" "" I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good , even if it was a false flag , "" he wrote . "" To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation . I of course realize now , this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism . "" The hate crime hurt the community . Residents say it gave outsiders the wrong impression of Bean Blossom . Jody Boyd is relieved the mystery is apparently solved . "" Just knowing the hate crimes will be stopped here in Brown County , maybe things will be put to rest , "" Boyd said . If convicted , Stang could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined as much as $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> . Reached by phone Wednesday , he had nothing to say . The church had no comment on the arrest , but Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis Bishop Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows issued the following statement about the vandalism : I was saddened to learn this morning that the vandalism of St . David ’ s Church in Bean Blossom was committed by the church ’ s organist , Nathan Stang , who has admitted to police that he spray painted hateful graffiti on the church last November in the wake of the presidential election . This was a hurtful , dishonest , and profoundly misguided action that stands against the values of the people of this diocese and the Episcopal Church , and we will continue to cooperate with the authorities who are pursuing this case ."

Is the lesson to stop handing propaganda victories to your enemies too tough to digest ? HA . Another MUH PR fag . That shit never works because if your enemy is in charge of the distribution of propaganda then there is no amount of begging that you can do to change what they will publish . Moreover trust in the media is at the lowest its ever been as the internet becomes more widespread . Go back to gaymergate days and find out why constantly capitulating to their enemies for good PR flooded their movement with leftist politics and brought about their eventual downfall . Muh pr has always been a losing strategy and if you actually endorse it then you will lose . A good recent example is cnn blackmail , maybe political strategy isnt your thing And what strategy do you propose besides the always losing muh pr strategy ? Ridicule and truth are effective strategies , it got trump in the white house and its turned generation z into the most conservative generation weve seen in decades . Socialist policies are already killing this country , its technically living own borrowed time , once it collapses ( and it will , no bubble lasts forever and keynes admitted that the end result of his economics is "" who cares , we'll be dead by then "" ) there is nothing that will attract these iphone owning , starcucks loving , materialistic revolutionaries of the left . Antifags and shit like blm are either paid by soros or literal larpers who refuse to come to terms with the fact that marx was wrong and capitalism did not die because it provided more goods to the worker than socialism and communism ever could . The proper way to handle muh car of peace or muh nazis incident is to use video of the event to show the centrists what side to pick . Emotional blackmail works well too , go tell a british leftist the myriad of rapes of children are on her as she voted to import the very rapists responsible and the PC policies that kept their operation running . The best strategy you can induce is to ask questions because your average leftie cannot provide a logical answer or justification for their beliefs exposing their cult mentality . Nah I'm just cucking . Keep trying to resuscitate "" dems r real racists "" for killing of civilians , and the Nazi Movement . Just make sure you don't question why Spencer insists you preform the CPR on his little Richard . You bring up spencer like i actually give a single shit about some e-celeb who is only there to make a profit . Dems are real racists is a fact though as a strategy its horrible because it falls under muh PR and because everyone is born racist due to the tribal nature of humans . "" I'm not racist , dems r real racists ! "" Meanwhile fake news reports the opposite . Sorry if my insults aren't good enough , to be fair though nothing could be quite as humiliating as living your daily life as a True Believer of the National Socialist Movement Admitting hitler loved his people , nation and did incredibly positive things such as rebuild an econony without kike banking , putting millions back to work , eliminating the crushing debt imposed on them via the treaty of Versailles , advancement of animal rights , preservation of nature , etc . is all just a matter of admitting the truth of a mans policies and actions . I dont care one bit for nazism , socialism will never work in the long run and it always leads to mass slaughter .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

2664	sjwhate	"i think one of the funniest examples of this is when sports fans argue whether their team is a "" dynasty "" or not . when a sports team wins multiple titles in a few years , or just comes close to doing so , this happens on sports debate tv shows like almost everything on ESPN these days , on local sports radio , and on almost every online sports forum . they argue whether a team is a "" dynasty "" or not . now , if you look at basically any dictionary you can see that the term , if applied to sports ( which probably shouldn't be ) would obviously mean something similar to a sports team that is dominant from generation to generation . the closest things i could think of would be the yankees or the lakers . there might be some down years but then after rebuilding , these teams typically don't just be come good but become dominant . but these guys will argue the dumbest shit like whether the tim duncan spurs are a dynasty , or the jordan bulls . and to me , those are the DIRECT opposites of dynasties as those are teams that were great ( still are for the spurs ) for one generation , but besides that , their history is basically that of a trash or mediocre underachieving team . so i used to put my <NUMBER> cents in about these arguments but i'd get push back saying things like ' dummy you know what we mean by dynasty ' . and i'd push back saying well no i don't cause you're using the word wrong and if the argument is to determine whether a team that's really good right now is a "" dynasty "" then i am sorry to rain on your parade but "" dynasty "" is not the word you're looking for . you're debating whether a team meets the definition of a word but you don't care what that word actually means . it's ridiculous and then after I explain it ( not in a rambling way like i am here lol ) but after i explain it , it always turns out that I am the dumb one for suggesting that a dictionary is a good place to start when the entire purpose of your weeks long argument is trying to prove whether a team meets the definition of a specific word . retards"	EXP

2823	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality .

If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children .

2826	fatpeoplehate	I agree , it's basically the effect of cognitive dissonance + weakness / immaturity . The cognitive dissonance is getting worse thanks to HAES and FA , and then since they're too weak to own up to what they did to their own body the easiest way for them to get over the cognitive dissonance is to blame anything they can cling on to ( genetics , the patriarchy , blah blah ) . The key for them is to not be responsible for their fatness , whether through bullshit HAES , trying to change the definition of beauty , or just flat out denying reality ( I saw a post about a fat saying calories don't exist . All of my what . ) I think there are quite a few former fats here who were uninformed when they were younger / living with parents but , when slapped by reality as they got older , were strong enough emotionally / maturity wise to own up to their bad diet . Rather than extremists , i think they're all just mentally children who deny the truth , throw tantrums and act based on their fee-fees , and refuse to take responsibility for their crap . They can't bring themselves to own up to what they did to their own bodies . If you look for it in posts , it's everywhere ( bankruptcy ham , hams crying about how it's not fair that they're fat / men don't like them / their doctor is telling them things that make their fee-fees hurt , etc ) And then society coddles them and the delusion gets worse ...

Compare how many people drive a car compared to how many people live in that neighborhood . Wrong the answer is biology . Twin studies prove that behaviors is more biological then environmental .

Truly , your parents , grandparents and their generations are ashamed of you . It occurred at Treblinka where the 700k - 900k victims were gassed with diesel fumes , corpses buried , then dug up and cremated en masse to "" cover up the crimes , "" I think you Problem is , there are no train records or aerial photographs that establish the delivery or existence of fuel adequate to accomplish the task , so it becomes necessary that the bodies must have been combustible without such means . That's not even to mention the implausibility of the scale of such an operation during such a short period . <NUMBER> - Fuel was on site . Besides wood , there were diesel engines . Perhaps you don't know this but humans are very , very combustible and have been burned to ash before the invention of petrol or discovery of magnesium . Human fat is an excellent propellant and clothing is an excellent wick . Don't believe , please go sleep with a cigarette burning . <NUMBER> - Because fuel delivery is not necessary it is also not necessary that combustion must occur without fuel . <NUMBER> - You believe it's out of the realm of possibility to incinerate a lot of people in a short time . Cute . There are so many examples from history that you already know about that I am sure you know how ridiculous that claim is . But , as pointed out , there's already photographic and scientific evidence of why you're wrong , so , doesn't matter . I assume you're talking specifically about the conspiracy to perpetrate the Hoax Yes , the hoax that the holocaust did not occur . You make a good attempt to deflect the accusation and chase a red herring and that in itself is enough evidence to show anyone that you cannot refute it . You know there's no conspiracy to fabricate the holocaust , and so you know you can't find evidence , and so you try to redirect . I'm sure anyone reading this will see that clearly , and not fall into the wall of delusion that is your essay , since I'm now pointing it out . :) Your plan isn't a bad one - redirect , confuse and drown - but it doesn't really work in text when you're dealing with a thinking human being , does it ? No , I would say not . Why is it that you loudmouths always try to preach and carry on so like that douche who recently got mouthpunched ? the actual Holocaust itself , for which there is in fact no existing evidence of communication ? LOL that's a fact is it ? <URL> <URL> It's like you don't even have Google . Is there anything else you'd like to me to find for you ? You seem challenged . As for your ' evidence ' it's an interesting memo , certainly , and it says one thing : Concentrate on the atrocities committed against the Jews and not on the atrocities that will be committed by the red army . I ... don't see where it says those atrocities against Jews didn't occur . Can you possibly point that out to me ? I'm sorry - it doesn't seem to be the smoking gun you think it is . Hardly even noteworthy , a typical political move . When an ally is bad distract . Simple . Just like you try to do - the Nazis were evil and you try to say , no the Jews were . Simple , yeah ? The wartime propaganda of extermination and death camps ( much of which was published before historians assert that the "" Holocaust "" ever began ) was simply validated in post-war efforts to cleanse Germany of Nazi party affiliation . Yes , it was . And rightly so You think the German people should have continued to live with the wool pulled over their eyes about what was happening ? And it was quite simply validated , true . Propaganda ... this word , at the time and before it , simply meant ( and technically STILL means ) distributed information . It doesn't mean true or false . If you think it does you might want to rethink that considering all the shit your dear leader published against Jews was also called propaganda . The Allied powers viewed it as necessary to accomplish a final defeat of Nazism and to validate the very nasty bombing campaign that resulted in millions of German civilians losing their lives What ? They had no need . There was no anti-war sentiment at home . You're ridiculous . Please , do provide proof of this nonsense . and the lie that began as completely fictional ( even historians recognize this ) bellylaugh.jpg <NUMBER> extermination rumors as part of the warmongering campaign of FDR finally stuck and is now written into the history books as absolute , unquestionable fact . Um ... wot ? People in America had no idea there was anything like this going on . There were some rumors , and everyone knew that the German Charlie Chaplin wannabe was an antisemite but they didn't really care - europe's problem - and there was plenty of antisemitism in the USA at the time as well . Lord have mercy . Get a clue . You've been fed so many lies it's amazing . Largely this is due to powerful Jewish groups co-opting the narrative shortly after the war to accomplish their own political goals ( most notably at the time the Zionists ) .

As there has been zero coverage of this story it can not possibly have been overblown nor exaggerated and it seems like you just assumed it was "" overblown "" that up to justify the next portion of your rant . Okay , as to the rest , I honestly don't know what to say . Are you arguing that Israel wants to kill all white people ? Do you have any proof of this claim ? I am willing to entertain your argument , but I hope you understand that this seems completely batshit insane to anyone not initiated into the ideology or the culture of this sub lol . Do you have any leaked intelligence or Israeli government documents about this plan ? Or any evidence at all , because I'm very interested in reading it . As two your final two sentences , I believe them to be correct , but this is not exclusive to Israel ( although they do have a particularly ruthless intelligence and security establishment ) but is standard practice of all states and securiy organizations since the beginning of recorded history . The principle objective of any state is survival of the state and as the Palmerstonian principle goes , states have no perpetual allies or enemies , merely perpetual interests , so obviously Israel will make pacts with anyone , just like every other country , like Britain , who Lord Palmerston was referring to , or the US . US history is suffused with making pacts with literally any pro-US or anti-Soviet regime , forcing the nation to adopt the Washinon consensus , open up their markets to American corporations , draining them of their natural resources via oil / mining / agriculture corporations and then ditching them when they're of no use . Israel does have a long history of false flags against the US but you are implying that the US has no agency in its close relationship with the Israelis . There are important strategic reasons the US allied with Israel openly after the ' <NUMBER> war and used them as an offshore stabilizer in the Near East , as well as other reasons why they have maintained this relationship , which includes an important relationship between their intelligence agencies ( involving CIA hotshots like James Jesus Angleton and Ted Shackley ) . Anyway , your entire post seems predicated on the idea that states behave morally or immorally ... most people in the realist camp of international relations would argue that states are amoral in the realm of foreign policy and advancing their national interest , neither the US nor Israel deviate much from this principle ."

3728	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

3798	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power .

Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

The bible is a collection of stories about god and that's how Christians perceive it , so there's a lot of room for cherry picking and fitting it somehow into western society . The Quran is thought to be THE word of god and that's how Muslims perceive it . It's difficult to cherry pick the verses you like and disregard the ones you don't . You either take it all or leave it all . That was the sort of moral dilemma I was trapped into when I was a Muslim . There were a lot of verses in the Quran that I didn't agree with and I tried so hard to interpret them in a way that makes them have a somewhat good meaning that is compatible with modern human values , but being a native speaker of Arabic who understood exactly what the verses meant in a literal sense , I felt that I was being disingenuous and I stopped lying to myself not long after that . I don't think the effort to modernize Islam is going to be very fruitful , not until Muslims admit that the Quran is not actually perfect in anyway and couldn't have been written by god ( assuming that he exists ) , which is not easy .

3837	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	"You do realize that animals eat plants , right ? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten ? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death .

4535	uncensorednews	Im on mobile so im not able to articulate my thoughts as much , but im going to do my best here . Im following you on pretty much all of your main points but where you lost me is where you mentioned using the word racist is a non-argument . I counter this by the fact that racism is defined by the use of racial slurs and sterotypes , so by my saying you are racist I am arguing that you fit into this category of people who act in this manner . I certainly dont think im more right than you , but by calling you a racist ( referring to your example ) im showing you that im taking a stance opposite to you , defined by my use of the word to separate my views from yours . ( Again in the exmaple because I dont know all of your ideas / views ) Surpirsingly enough I agree with much of what you said , but I disagree that my use of a certain word makes my argument invalid . I could have just as easily laid out a detailed rebuttal of why I believe you are racist , but I instead chose to use that specific word because by definition it supports my argument to do so . On the flip side I also see how there is a very thin line between arguing that someone is a racist , and using the word as a cop out as you put it . In the future ill make sure not to rely on the word alone to support my ideas , but I will continue to use it in discussion because I believe it does support those views .	IMP

4555	europeannationalism	I am from an Eastern Europeean country where the problem with migrants and refugees is not that major yet . However , this certainly does not mean that we shouldn't do anything , especially considering the state of the Western World . Most people in the country absolutely despise Muslim migrants , gypsies ( since there are many of them here ) and , of course , we are not big fans of Islam in general . However , most right-wing organizations in our country are just skinheads who have nothing new to offer , and they are simply promoting the same ideas - race war now , kill all shitskins , etc . This does not attract new followers , nor does it change anything ( apart from the fact that they beat up gypsies on a regular basis ) . This is why we decided to form a new organization which features primarily people from our country , but we are also attracting members from outside of our nation . Last month we met a Dutch guy who came across our stickers in the streets and joined our Discord channel , and in a few weeks we are meeting a guy from the U . S . who's going on an European trip and decided to visit our city after he had a chat with us . While most of the founders of our project share the far-right believes of the skinheads in our country , we realize that this is not the way to attract more people on our side . That's why we are taking a more subtle approach that will allow us to have conversations with ' regular people ' who are still uncertain whether they should lean to the left or right side of things . Apart from the stickers we are distributing around the city , we also make sure to clean up our streets from any leftist stickers , art , etc . We also may or may not take care of some Jewish monuments , portraits of Che , ( ( ( Marx ) ) ) , etc . These is the first batch of stickers we ordered - <URL> These are the translated variants , the ones we put up on the streets are in Cyrillic , but we'll also order an English batch to pair with them . As you can see , the stickers are not that harsh , and we are hoping that this will attract the attention of not just the far-right people , but of the ' average person ' . One of the guys in our organizations also provided us with some less-friendly stickers that we are distributing , but not associating our name with . We thought people like us were needed because as of recent years , more and more go to some of the Western countries for their bachelor's degree , and they end up being brainwashed into believing the liberal ideas . We hope that our presence will at least slightly reduce the number of people who end up falling for the white genocide propaganda being pushed in our faces on a daily basis .	EXP

I'll concede your point , except to say that it sounds more like rabid nationalism than a violent religious belief .

The Dalai Lama said "" Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness , tolerance , compassion . If from one corner of your mind , some emotion makes you want to hit , or want to kill , then please remember Buddha's faith . We are followers of Buddha . "" He said that "" All problems must be solved through dialogue , through talk . The use of violence is outdated , and never solves problems .

Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same .

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages .

4709	uncensorednews	A movie is not history . It is entertainment . To say you are rewriting history by producing a piece of entertainment is silly . If people are dumb enough to think that any movie is the truth , they are deluding themselves . That said , I enjoy entertainment where I can suspend my disbelief . So in a period piece of entertainment such as Dunkirk , to have an Asian , Hispanic , African or Inuit person as a British pilot would not make sense . I would not be offended in the sense that this is not history ( it was not history to begin with ) , but my entertainment experience would not be as rich because it would make no sense .	EXP

4773	sjwhate	"part <NUMBER> : WHY do you care ? denying the Holocaust can easily be proven to be willful ignorance Why does it matter whether people ignorant of this , given that people are ignorant of pretty much all history ? I know the answer : Because Nazis were super evil , and we need to remember that , to stave off the threat of this ultimate evil coming back . Lack of recognition of a threat is itself a threat . This is fine and I applaud you for trying to prevent future harm . What it is implying though , is that without the Holocaust , the Nazis wouldn't appear evil or dangerous enough to stop their return . The preceding statement is either <NUMBER> . ) false , because there is plenty of evil to point at to stave off future Nazism , which means "" holocaust denial "" is actually no threat at all because the evil will still be prevented regardless of belief in holocaust . Or , <NUMBER> . ) true ... which leads to two possibilities : a . ) the holocaust did happen and there is enough evidence to prove it , in which case "" holocaust denial "" is no threat because of the dominant view on the matter which people are strongly attached to combined with the overwhelming weight of evidence preclude it from getting traction . b . ) the Holocaust DID happen but there is NOT enough evidence to prove it . That is the only scenario under which "" holocaust denial "" is a threat . To make a decent case of "" holocaust denial "" being dangerous , it is necessary to say there is not enough evidence of to prove holocaust happened ... - - - CONCLUSION / TL ;D R : If one asserts that the discussion of holocaust is not irrelevant , either "" holocaust deniers "" should be given platform , resulting in them getting crushed by the evidence , or the "" holocaust acknowledgers "" are saying they don't have proof of holocaust - - actually echoing the "" denier "" stance Therefore , the only way to not effectively support "" holocaust denial "" is to advocate for the study and discussion of "" holocaust denier's "" arguments . You might respond to that argument with something like : "" Isn't it better to still assume the holocaust happened , even if we don't have enough evidence it happened ? Just to be safe from a future hypothetical holocaust ? It doesn't cost us anything to assume it was real . "" ... It actually HAS cost us a LOT , and it is going to continue costing us . The clearest example is current day Germany . What happened was largely made possible by Germans being conditioned with guilt and self-loathing over the Holocaust . part <NUMBER> : EXTRA There's no confusion about whether or not it happened Tell me , what percentage of people who accept the narrative of Holocaust are know a a lot about it , beside some buzzword assertions like "" gas chambers "" , "" ovens "" , "" <NUMBER> million Jews murdered "" or can only cite evidence that doesn't directly corroborate the holocaust story like "" there were piles of starved-looking corpses after the war "" ? I would say over <NUMBER> % . Are those people , who are merely repeating assertions , not ALSO ignorant ? ... Now to the people who actually aren't ignorant , the historians ... Your comment sort of gave the idea of history being a finely-refined monolithic set of true statements , but of course historians do disagree on what actually happened to a degree . On a lot of things , e . g . the the great depression , they disagree more than the general public , who are like "" capitalism failed , FDR saved lol "" . Right there , you have an example of people who disagree with the mainstream narrative actually being more likely to know anything at all about the topic , and actually having looked at the evidence . But , don't all historians agree the holocaust is real ? First off , most historians focus on different parts of history so their opinion isn't worth more than that of any random person , but yes , there have been actual historians who publicly disputed parts , or the entirety , of the holocaust narrative . Those people lost their jobs and got blacklisted , some were threatened with violence and had to change their identity , some even got arrested , tried and imprisoned for it . Now , do you think that might affect the inclinations of the rest of historians to publicly question the established holocaust narrative ? Not saying they are liars , it's enough for them to avoid looking into the topic or to keep their views to themselves . part <NUMBER> : extra Nazi's themselves admit to it [ ... ] Is the Holocaust a nazi conspiracy to paint themselves as evil ? It is fine for you to believe this , given how often such claims are put forward by the professional holocaust-pushers . While anyone can say "" I'm a Nazi and holocaust was real "" , did actual Nazis admit to it ? The only person charged at Nuremberg with personally killing Jews , Ernst Kaltenbrunner , testified that he received no such orders and first heard about holocaust from foreign media . The concentration camp guards who corroborated the holocaust narrative left the Soviet interrogation rooms with their testicles destroyed . I think you'll agree those testimonies are worthless . There are no government records , or records by Third Reich officials that mention systematic mass-murder of Jews , only the removal of Jews from the Third Reich and from Europe , which was not a secret but the publicly stated policy . The confession of the "" Nazi "" arch-witness at Nuremberg , Rudolf Hoess , was acquired after <NUMBER> days of him being beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep , exposed to the elements and force-fed with alcohol . ( source : Death Dealer , Legions of Death ) Due to his state at the time , he did not remember the confession afterwards . The confession conflicts with physical evidence , e . g . he confessed to murdering <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> million people , while today the official holocaust figure for Auschwitz is <NUMBER> million . Such testimony is not admissible in a real court , but it was nevertheless used to justify his subsequent execution . part <NUMBER> : After the war , Churchill , Eisenhower and DeGaule all wrote memoirs detailing the war period . None of them mentions gas chambers or any mass extermination scheme . ... Let that sink in , what is today widely perceived as one of the most profound events in history , they decided to completely OMIT mentioning ? Why , especially as them "" Holocaust-enders "" ended up being such massive boost to their legacy ? Possible explanations : <NUMBER> ) They were secretly hardcore Nazis <NUMBER> ) The Nazis left behind a spy network that overpowered the US / UK / Israel secret services , took over the western world , and threatened them into not writing about the holocaust <NUMBER> ) Despite having encouraged the holocaust rumors at the time , they were unwilling to destroy their reputation by going on permanent record as promoters of a story that they believed would soon be exposed as a despicable lie ( it is not very nice to falsely accuse people of murder ) . part <NUMBER> : debunking supposed holocaust evidence , reviewing revisionist evidence Wasted too much time on this as it is , you can find directions to revisionist arguments and resources at the holocaust subreddit .

She banned a guy for asking "" how did historians arrive at the six million number , "" I'm not kidding or making that up . The sort of consensus that you've seen , in such an environment , is by design , not by neutral historians following evidence . The Soviet Union was being extremely aggressive in its foreign policy in <NUMBER> , particularly , and of course completely escaped blame for splitting up Poland with Germany in <NUMBER> , while Germany apparently deserved to be destroyed for it . The Winter War against Finland everybody knows , but the annexation of the Baltic states , Bessarabia and North Bukovina , and Vyacheslav Molotov's demands at a subsequent meeting with Joachim von Ribbentrop and Hitler made it apparent to Hitler at least that the Soviets were intent on bullying a Germany weakened from the Battle of France into concessions that would have doomed its oil supply , and future ability to defend itself . All this is completely overlooked in the leadup to World War II . Whereas everybody is aware of Germany "" taking over the world "" ( as if the British and French had not already done so ) by peacefully reclaiming and occupying German speaking lands it held before World War II in the Rhineland , Bohemia , Poland , and the Anschluss , which was merely a lesser realization of Großdeutschland delayed by <NUMBER> years , and welcomed by its population , nobody pays the slightest mind to the Soviet Union spreading communism westward toward Europe ; there was no Munich Conference for it , no discussion whatsoever about what all this portended , despite the tens of millions dead from the Russian Civil War , the Kronstadt Rebellion , war communism , the Five Year Plans , collectivization , the Holodomor , the Great Purge , compared to ... broken glass of store windows from Kristallnacht . The composition of many of the commissars forcing peasants onto kolkhoz while deporting so-called "" kulaks "" as revenge for Kishinev and other pogroms , and that of the victims of the Night of Broken Glass , and the international press , make the reasons for this valuing of a stubbed toenail over a genocide abundantly clear . Without looking , I'm sure they'll talk about the Five Year Plans , how Stalin said they had to advance <NUMBER> years in <NUMBER> , Stalin's freakout after Barbarossa launched . What they won't talk about is Hans-Ulrich Rudel and others ' observations of Soviet positions , which were curiously extended far westward in positions that would have made zero sense for defense in depth . That's the problem with that sub and establishment historians , they determine the parameters of the discussion before it even begins . With the growth and dominance of the Holocaust Industry , taxpayer-funded Holocaust museums , Israel and the U . S . ' s special relationship , and the overwhelming presence and influence of Jews and Jewish ideas in History Departments , all this is simply a taboo subject , or as close to such as to make a pariah of even a Jew like Arno Mayer , though he of course has seen his prospects remain in a better state than , say , Germar Rudolf . This can be seen all the way down to even petty censorship on internet fora like reddit , where asking questions and looking into a topic is grounds for being silenced . Not for the Holodomor , not for the Bengal famine , not for the Taiping Rebellion or the Great Leap Forward , only for one topic , and the suffering of one people . Any deviation from the gospel ( except when the Auschwitz and Majdanek museums do it , or "" functionalists "" like Christopher Browning ) is to be seen as wrong , it's an article of faith that "" Holocaust Denial "" is a monolith of deviance that is to be pathologized , and its uniform adherents to be slandered , fired , and humiliated , when not imprisoned outside the U . S . Understanding this bizarre climate is key to understanding why you've got the responses that you have . Rather than listening to those spin doctors and their pre-ordained conclusions , just listen to Hitler himself discuss the run up to Barbarossa , his reluctant decision to launch it over the objections of his generals , and the massive tank buildup which had been going on in the Soviet Union and directed at western Europe . Really interesting bit of history , he was secretly recorded talking with Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim , the great Finnish general , on a train in <NUMBER> , [ right here . ] ( <URL> Be very careful on looking to wikipedia for anything accurate , especially regarding the Holocaust . Like most major media of information , there are people behind the scenes making sure that a very ... [ favorable interpretation ] ( <URL> is put forward , from their perspective . It's ultimately as reliable as talking to a guy on the street . It's not a crazy conspiracy , not by estherke , or those wikipedia editors , or the media , it's just people looking out for their own people's interests . All it means is that it takes an extra level of looking into things , because there can sometimes be a deliberate veil placed between us and the truth . Aeschylus's observation that truth is the first casualty of war holds true to today , and the largest war in history has predictably had the most untruth attached to it ."	EXP

5066	milliondollarextreme	Automation actually drives prices down so it would be helping those who have less money . This is wrong . Interest , capital and rent will always be costs of production for a business , whereas labor may not be . Certainly labor is the most expendable of these factors as there is and always has been a systemic glut . As labor shrinks to a minimum out of the total costs of production , rent , capital and interest will make up the remainder of the income streams . Therefore the lower the labor costs in an economy , the greater the disparity between the purchasing power of the currency and labor-based income , as well as demand in general for that matter . TL ;D R - Even if automation drives labor to zero , the costs of business will remain non-zero , and therefore the reduction of labor costs by necessity only benefits those whose incomes are non-labor derived . And as for people not deserving to struggle , struggle isn't something inflicted upon one person by another . Don't confuse human systems with a state of nature .

Auschwitz at it's peak had no equal in history , not even close . This is the singular thing that makes the Nazis stand out from all others . They were the first to apply the principles of the industrial revolution to mass murder . Comparatively , Stalin and Mao's actions make some sense , brutal as they were . Starving the Ukraine was done to break a perceived enemy , not born of some personal or cultural hatred . The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution were not programs of intentional murder but attempts at cultural transformation , albeit with cruel indifference to the human cost , but the aims were rational .

If you left a bunch of diverse babies in a sensory deprivation chamber and didn't impart them with any parenting or knowledge , the black babies wouldn't be implicitly more violent than the white ones .

5832	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

5853	uncensorednews	I hear you , a lot of people haven't been exposed to that kind of epidemic . However a closer inspection by the medical community reveals that people don't really ' OD ' on cocaine but have long term cardiac disease , similar to fried chicken . The majority of deaths in the cocaine trade , by FAR , is violence between drug sellers . Heroin is a horrible evil addiction and overdosing is a real possibility . However many overdoses occur because of the wide spectrum of potency . Some heroin is so supplemented with other ( dangerous ) stuff that the user barely gets high ; and some is so powerful it will kill the user . Not knowing the potency of the drug is what leads to many overdoses . There are also the many longer term health effects of intravenous heroin use , often caused by sharing needles and using poor venipunture technique . A heroin user with a steady supply of consistent heroin who uses good aseptic technique can live a long time ( William Burroughs ) , not that that seems like a happy life . My point is that if you really hate the deaths and lives wrecked by drugs close inspection will reveal their illegality is a leading factor . Sometimes hating drugs so much leads us to hate them at the expense of saving lives . That is what's happening in America .	EXP

5942	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

5954	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT
