6	fatpeoplehate	I worked in a jewellery store for a second job a few years ago , the boss was a total shitlord .

Average ring size is <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> . SO , she comes back after the engagement to get her ring size , it wouldn't even go over the knuckle , it was way to small . She had to get it sized to a <NUMBER> ... yes an <NUMBER> . That is huge , especially for a woman . Most men are a <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> . The ring basically had to double in size . The boss told her what had to be done , and he couldn't size her ring up that much ( because it had diamonds all over the band , and if it was sized that much , it would have to be re-built ) and a new one would have to be re-ordered in the correct size . This hambeast freaked , make such a scene . The boss finally agreed , we would order a new ring , but they would have to pay for the difference , since it would be a couple hundred more for all the extra gold used in the ring ( fucking duh ) . The man who bought it said no problem , and admitted he should have gotten her ring size first . But this woman , my god . All I can remember is her chins jiggling as she was complaining . But yea , the boss once had to fire a girl , because she got so big she couldn't fit around or behind the showcases .	EXP

109	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

120	sjwhate	The seeds of SJW uprising have been around for a very long time . It's only recently that it's started to flood over the edge in a really big way . The internet is in part responsible for that but so is post generation dogma and the gradual penetration of our institutions in particular due to the people having voted for a far left political part to rule our nation for over a decade . <URL> <URL> A lot of it comes from the major shifts over the last century to address genuine inequality in society . The problem is the ideology and movement still hasn't gone . It's actually bigger than ever . The bar is simply lowering . My first SJW experience was decades ago . I was <NUMBER> and went to the shops . On the way back I went through the alley where a young adult Pakistani mugged me for my change on the way back from the <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . So I got home and told my mother what had happened . I was also angry and vented my anger saying that he was a fucking criminal scum also a fucking paki and whatever else came to mind as you do . Instead of calling the police or anything like that she couldn't care less because I had in anger said the forbidden word Paki which apparently was worse than someone threatening a kid's life for their money . Since then I've been pretty much anti-SJW through and through . It's beyond my wildest nightmares though that it has become normal for society and not merely representative of the few insane people such as my criminal apologist mother . I don't really have a problem with Pakistanis but if one threatens to stab you then you can go figure calling him names shortly after the incident might be the kind of thing that one would naturally be expected to do .

322	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

494	holocaust	"You're also ignoring the fact that ppm is a measure of concentration , not the amount of Zyklon to produce that concentration . I wasn't ignoring that I must have failed in being clear , but I was trying to say that before we can talk about hydrocyanic gas concentrations , the pellets have to slowly evaporate until the deadly concentration is reached . According to the story , there was only 20minutes until everyone died from inhaling the deadly gas at high enough of a concentration to kill . I contend that it would have taken much longer than 20minutes to reach that concentration in such a huge and cold room . I don't know if you've seen the pictures of camp survivors but I'd be surprised if most people weighed over <NUMBER> kg and would require a smaller concentration to kill . You are thinking about pictures of inmates from the end of the war in <NUMBER> . I think you forget that the the "" extermination plan "" is only supposed to have lasted <NUMBER> . 5years at Auschwitz from <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> ( <URL> You can find pictures of Auschwitz inmates from that time period and they do not look malnourished or wasting away as they do in <NUMBER> . You can find pictures of the prisoners at the yad vashem site under the "" Auschwitz Album "" <URL> . They look nothing like the Typhus ridden skeletons that are usually shown as "" victims of Hitler "" . ( picture of child suffering from typhoid fever in south africa - <URL> / media / File : LizzieVanZyl.jpg ) Secondly there are multiple sources I've found that has chambers could be heated to facilitate gas release from pellets / discs This is true ... for the delousing facilities . They had a special machine that heated the pellets and fanned the gas throughout the room ( pictures of such device <URL> But this is not what is alleged for the killing operation and none of the witnesses or sonderkommandos attest to the morgues being heated . The pellets of Zyklon are just dropped in overhead . I also never said that it took <NUMBER> hours for the gas to be released . My bad . I thought you were referring to the fact that outside of Auschwitz , in places were vermin were killed with Zyklon B , like on ships , they would leave the premises for <NUMBER> - 48hours for the gas to fully evaporate and dissipate . My point was just that once the Zyklon was dropped into the morgue , it would take many hours before the liquid was fully evaporated . No amount of fanning would make this a quick procedure especially since after killing <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> people , the zyklon would be trapped underneath a bunch of bodies . It would continually give off poison gas and would surely kill anyone coming into the morgue to remove the bodies . edit : I did some reading on the heating of morgue I of Krema II and found this in Jean Claude Pressac's book : <URL> ( you can find the book in pdf format in the sidebar of this sub ) JCP talks about some order that was never found that supposedly mentioned heating the morgues to cause a quick death , he gives this big explanation but concludes by saying that a fire was started and thus the whole plan was scrapped Therefore the morgues were not preheated . If you want to believe the people who call themselves witnesses , then it makes sense that they would not have reported pre-heated morgues in their testimonies . So we are to believe that the Zyklon B pellets filled with liquid HCN evaporated and reached the deadly concentration in a cold underground room within 20minutes ( much less really since it would take time between inhalation and death ) . What you need to picture is a glass of water being put in a room . Obviously , after some time it would evaporate - but it would be ridiculous to think that the glass would be empty after <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> minutes .

661	uncensorednews	Quaestores was the name given to people that practiced the unrestricted sale of indulgences . No , it wasn't . The quaestores were lay officers who were charged with handling the quaestua , the collection of alms . Because , as was typical of Medieval offices , the quaestores provided for themselves from the activity they were charged with , many became greed profiteers , a problem exacerbated by the fact that Catholic rulers used quaestores under their control to divert a portion of the quaestua for their own uses . The Countil of Trent sought to fix this problem by abolishing the lay quaestores and shifting the duty of quaestua to canons only , which would automatically prevent the institutionalized profiteering by both removing the ability for rulers to exploit the quaestua as well as preventing the alms collectors from taking a portion of the alms for themselves .

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) .

1102	explainlikeimfive	, has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big . Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

1240	uncensorednews	if he were preaching against homosexuality he was also not preaching the word of Jesus . Jesus said a grand total of exactly nothing for or against homosexuality . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus didn't have to say anything about homosexuality . The reason is because no first-century Jew ever had any question as to whether homosexual behavior was morally permissible or not . They all knew that it was condemned . Why ? Because every reference to sex and marriage in the Old Testament , every poem , and every metaphor presumes heterosexual sex and heterosexual marriage . Every reference to homosexuality in the Old Testament was negative . So , there's no question as to what Jews and other people who were listening to Jesus at the time that he was speaking would have thought about the question of homosexuality . There was no need for him to address it . - <NUMBER> ) Even if it turns out that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality , what follows from that ? Nothing . Even if Jesus never said anything about it , it doesn't mean that he therefore thinks that it's morally permissible to engage in homosexual sex . This would be simply an argument from silence . After all , Jesus never said anything about drunkenness , child sacrifice , or neglecting the elderly , but clearly we wouldn't say that Jesus thinks that those things are morally permissible . It's quite possible that he never said anything about it , but that does not mean that therefore he thinks that homosexuality is okay . - <NUMBER> ) It's not certain that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality . It's quite possible that he did say something about homosexuality but that it wasn't recorded by the gospel authors . After all , the gospel writers didn't put down everything that Jesus said , only the things that they deemed relevant to their audiences . In fact , in John <NUMBER> the gospel writer says , “ and Jesus did many other things that if they were written in books there would be so many books we couldn't even fit them in the world . ” In other words , there are lots of things that Jesus said and did that weren't documented . It's quite possible that Jesus did say something about homosexuality but because it wasn't really a hot-button issue of the day , the gospel writers didn ’ t include it in the gospel accounts . - <NUMBER> ) We do know what Jesus would have said about homosexuality if he were asked . Why ? Because Jesus was an observant Jew , and as an observant Jew , he upheld the Law of Moses . In fact , many times when he was in conversations with people , he would reference the Mosaic Law . He would say the greatest commandment , “ Love your God with all your heart , soul , strenh , and mind , and love your neighbor as yourself . ” When the Jews were talking to Jesus about marriage and divorce , he even said , “ What did Moses teach you in the law ? ” So he would often uphold the Law of Moses because it was still binding . Therefore , if Jesus was asked , “ What do you think about homosexuality ? ” We know what he would say . He would have simply cited the Levitical prohibitions in Leviticus <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , which clearly teach that homosexuality is sin . So again , even if he was asked , we know what he would have said . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus does voice his opinion on matters of sex and marriage . When Jesus is answering a question about divorce in Matthew <NUMBER> , Jesus cites the creation account where it says that a man will leave his parents and be united to his wife and they shall become one flesh . Notice , Jesus ' view of sex and marriage is one man , with one woman , becoming one flesh , for one lifetime . Then Jesus says , “ What God has ordained , let no man separate . ” What God has brought together , let no man separate . In other words , God Himself is ordaining this heterosexual union of man and wife . So , if Jesus ’ view on sex and marriage is for one man and one woman to come together in a heterosexual union , then this would automatically disqualify all other forms of sex and all other forms of marriage . That would include fornication , adultery , and of course even homosexuality . In other words , by Jesus taking a stance on what sex and marriage is about , heterosexually speaking , then therefore , this disqualifies all other forms of sexual behavior , including homosexuality . - <NUMBER> ) Jesus does basically say that homosexuality is a sin , and we see this in Mark <NUMBER> where Jesus is talking about what makes a man unclean and what defiles a man . He says that it's from within a man's heart and what comes out of it that ultimately makes a man unclean . He says sexual immorality , theft , murder , and a whole bunch of other things . The Greek word that's used for sexual immorality is “ porneia , ” and that Greek word is a reference to sexual sins of which homosexuality would be included . No first-century Jew would hear the word “ porneia ” and not automatically think that Jesus is making reference to the sexual sins that are listed in Leviticus <NUMBER> and Leviticus <NUMBER> . - <NUMBER> ) Saying that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality presumes that the words of Jesus are somehow more authoritative than the words of Scripture elsewhere . It's the Holy Spirit , God Himself , who has inspired all the words of Scripture , not just the red letters . Of course , that would include passages like Leviticus <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , Romans <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> Corinthians <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> Timothy <NUMBER> where Scripture clearly condemns homosexual sex and says it ’ s not morally permissible . Since Jesus and the Holy Spirit are part of the Trinity , they have been living in perfect holy communion for all eternity past . Chances are , Jesus and the Holy Spirit agree with each other . Therefore , Jesus ’ view would be the same as the Holy Spirit ’ s view who inspired all of Scripture of where we see many passages that clearly condemn homosexual behavior . Any one of those seven responses is sufficient to respond to this challenge , but when you combine all seven of them together , it leaves no possibility for sustaining the idea that just because Jesus never said anything about homosexuality in the Bible , therefore Jesus is ok with homosexual behavior . He's not . - [ source ] ( <URL>	EXP

Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money . Man the Israel propaganda machine has done a real number on you . But yeah israel is all mean to people that are shooting rockets at their cities day in day out and who send suicidebombers to blow up their kids , how uncivilized to not simply be happy about that right ? And they killed jesus right ? but you are just being reasonable right ? right ... We're not talking about any of that , we're talking about how the US is Israels bitch :) Besides , Israels terrorist activities , numerous crimes against humanity , and general constant dickishness does not go away because of what someone else did . I'll let you have the last word , I'm not going to reply anymore to someone so stupid who thinks that pumping oil out of the ground is free or that Saudi Arabia paying for US aircraft is the same thing as the US giving Israel aircraft for free .

Is the lesson to stop handing propaganda victories to your enemies too tough to digest ? HA . Another MUH PR fag . That shit never works because if your enemy is in charge of the distribution of propaganda then there is no amount of begging that you can do to change what they will publish . Moreover trust in the media is at the lowest its ever been as the internet becomes more widespread . Go back to gaymergate days and find out why constantly capitulating to their enemies for good PR flooded their movement with leftist politics and brought about their eventual downfall . Muh pr has always been a losing strategy and if you actually endorse it then you will lose . A good recent example is cnn blackmail , maybe political strategy isnt your thing And what strategy do you propose besides the always losing muh pr strategy ? Ridicule and truth are effective strategies , it got trump in the white house and its turned generation z into the most conservative generation weve seen in decades . Socialist policies are already killing this country , its technically living own borrowed time , once it collapses ( and it will , no bubble lasts forever and keynes admitted that the end result of his economics is "" who cares , we'll be dead by then "" ) there is nothing that will attract these iphone owning , starcucks loving , materialistic revolutionaries of the left . Antifags and shit like blm are either paid by soros or literal larpers who refuse to come to terms with the fact that marx was wrong and capitalism did not die because it provided more goods to the worker than socialism and communism ever could . The proper way to handle muh car of peace or muh nazis incident is to use video of the event to show the centrists what side to pick . Emotional blackmail works well too , go tell a british leftist the myriad of rapes of children are on her as she voted to import the very rapists responsible and the PC policies that kept their operation running . The best strategy you can induce is to ask questions because your average leftie cannot provide a logical answer or justification for their beliefs exposing their cult mentality . Nah I'm just cucking . Keep trying to resuscitate "" dems r real racists "" for killing of civilians , and the Nazi Movement . Just make sure you don't question why Spencer insists you preform the CPR on his little Richard . You bring up spencer like i actually give a single shit about some e-celeb who is only there to make a profit . Dems are real racists is a fact though as a strategy its horrible because it falls under muh PR and because everyone is born racist due to the tribal nature of humans . "" I'm not racist , dems r real racists ! "" Meanwhile fake news reports the opposite . Sorry if my insults aren't good enough , to be fair though nothing could be quite as humiliating as living your daily life as a True Believer of the National Socialist Movement Admitting hitler loved his people , nation and did incredibly positive things such as rebuild an econony without kike banking , putting millions back to work , eliminating the crushing debt imposed on them via the treaty of Versailles , advancement of animal rights , preservation of nature , etc . is all just a matter of admitting the truth of a mans policies and actions . I dont care one bit for nazism , socialism will never work in the long run and it always leads to mass slaughter . I'm merely a white nationalist and even hold some libertarian ideals to mix with a traditionalist view of society . and their never-ending blunders and their worship of ineffectual shysters .

Good luck You think it requires searching to refute often-repeated lies ? That's cute . All I wonder is if you really believe the bullshit you're spouting or if you're an even worse kind of denier - the kind who knows he's lying and does it either for the appreciation lauded upon him by his peers or to recruit others to his cause for personal gain . Truly , your parents , grandparents and their generations are ashamed of you . It occurred at Treblinka where the 700k - 900k victims were gassed with diesel fumes , corpses buried , then dug up and cremated en masse to "" cover up the crimes , "" I think you Problem is , there are no train records or aerial photographs that establish the delivery or existence of fuel adequate to accomplish the task , so it becomes necessary that the bodies must have been combustible without such means . That's not even to mention the implausibility of the scale of such an operation during such a short period . <NUMBER> - Fuel was on site . Besides wood , there were diesel engines . Perhaps you don't know this but humans are very , very combustible and have been burned to ash before the invention of petrol or discovery of magnesium . Human fat is an excellent propellant and clothing is an excellent wick . Don't believe , please go sleep with a cigarette burning . <NUMBER> - Because fuel delivery is not necessary it is also not necessary that combustion must occur without fuel . <NUMBER> - You believe it's out of the realm of possibility to incinerate a lot of people in a short time . Cute . There are so many examples from history that you already know about that I am sure you know how ridiculous that claim is . But , as pointed out , there's already photographic and scientific evidence of why you're wrong , so , doesn't matter . I assume you're talking specifically about the conspiracy to perpetrate the Hoax Yes , the hoax that the holocaust did not occur . You make a good attempt to deflect the accusation and chase a red herring and that in itself is enough evidence to show anyone that you cannot refute it . You know there's no conspiracy to fabricate the holocaust , and so you know you can't find evidence , and so you try to redirect . I'm sure anyone reading this will see that clearly , and not fall into the wall of delusion that is your essay , since I'm now pointing it out . :) Your plan isn't a bad one - redirect , confuse and drown - but it doesn't really work in text when you're dealing with a thinking human being , does it ? No , I would say not . Why is it that you loudmouths always try to preach and carry on so like that douche who recently got mouthpunched ? the actual Holocaust itself , for which there is in fact no existing evidence of communication ? LOL that's a fact is it ? <URL> <URL> It's like you don't even have Google . Is there anything else you'd like to me to find for you ? You seem challenged . As for your ' evidence ' it's an interesting memo , certainly , and it says one thing : Concentrate on the atrocities committed against the Jews and not on the atrocities that will be committed by the red army . I ... don't see where it says those atrocities against Jews didn't occur . Can you possibly point that out to me ? I'm sorry - it doesn't seem to be the smoking gun you think it is . Hardly even noteworthy , a typical political move . When an ally is bad distract . Simple . Just like you try to do - the Nazis were evil and you try to say , no the Jews were . Simple , yeah ? The wartime propaganda of extermination and death camps ( much of which was published before historians assert that the "" Holocaust "" ever began ) was simply validated in post-war efforts to cleanse Germany of Nazi party affiliation . Yes , it was . And rightly so You think the German people should have continued to live with the wool pulled over their eyes about what was happening ? And it was quite simply validated , true . Propaganda ... this word , at the time and before it , simply meant ( and technically STILL means ) distributed information . It doesn't mean true or false . If you think it does you might want to rethink that considering all the shit your dear leader published against Jews was also called propaganda . The Allied powers viewed it as necessary to accomplish a final defeat of Nazism and to validate the very nasty bombing campaign that resulted in millions of German civilians losing their lives What ? They had no need . There was no anti-war sentiment at home . You're ridiculous . Please , do provide proof of this nonsense . and the lie that began as completely fictional ( even historians recognize this ) bellylaugh.jpg <NUMBER> extermination rumors as part of the warmongering campaign of FDR finally stuck and is now written into the history books as absolute , unquestionable fact . Um ... wot ? People in America had no idea there was anything like this going on . There were some rumors , and everyone knew that the German Charlie Chaplin wannabe was an antisemite but they didn't really care - europe's problem - and there was plenty of antisemitism in the USA at the time as well . Lord have mercy . Get a clue . You've been fed so many lies it's amazing . Largely this is due to powerful Jewish groups co-opting the narrative shortly after the war to accomplish their own political goals ( most notably at the time the Zionists ) . And here comes the crazy . This would be part of that , "" Invisible non-communicating worldwide conspiracy , "" I first asked you about . Retarded . Seriously .

1966	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general .

1993	milliondollarextreme	""" I was raised in the Catholic Church . Curious about the motivations of the scientific atheists , I bought a copy of The Origin of Species . Surely it wasn't all hate and Satan-worship . My natural Catholic reaction was to be shocked at Mr . Darwin's work , but I read it carefully and found little in it I could refute . This , I think , is where books can lead you down a rabbit hole . I began to read Friedrich Nietzsche , especially the Genealogy of Morality . He said that Christian morality now dominated the West and glorified weakness , decay , failure , martyrdom , and a mentality of slavery . I started to roll my eyes when my Catholic friends talked about the Salvation of Christ . On one occasion I even , I am ashamed to admit , very diplomatically expressed negative thoughts to my wife about the Church . "" Given the fossil record , don't you think the Genesis creation story seems a little off ? "" She was taken aback : "" Isn't that a bit ... Satanist ? "" But the indoctrination was complete . It wasn't until a few weeks later when I heard my parish priest mocking the "" fossil record "" that I realized I'd become the atheist parrot I so despised . "" Atheism is just like a cult . What am I doing ? I'm becoming a Satanist arsehole . "" I threw all of my books away and told myself outright : "" You're becoming a Satanist . What you're doing is turning you into a terrible , hateful person . "" Until that moment I hadn't even realised that "" Satanist "" was what I was becoming ; I just thought I was a more open-minded person for tolerating these views . I've spent every day since feeling shameful for being so blind and so easily coerced . It seemed so subtle - at no point did my casual and growing interest in evolution was genuine Satanism . I haven't yet told my wife that this happened , and I honestly don ’ t know how to . I need to apologize for what I said and tell her that I certainly don't believe it . It is going to be a tough conversation and I'm not looking forward to it . I didn't think this could happen to me . But it did and it will haunt me for a long time to come ."	EXP

2150	worldnews	I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally . If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

2525	milliondollarextreme	When I was still at university I used to hang out with this older feminist chick because she was the only one in the class who liked to party the way I party .

2546	milliondollarextreme	"I currently have no plans for anything like forge , and with all the capabilities of a gaming computer these days , an in house game recorder is COSTLY . I have some plans on how to correctly provide paid content without splitting the community . So say each season a new paid season comes out ( $ <NUMBER> ) This would include : <NUMBER> new maps ( arena , objective , and scenario ) <NUMBER> new helmet types <NUMBER> player submitted designed helmet ( more info on that later , like a community gathering ) And <NUMBER> new armor types . Players who don't purchase the content day one , can still purchase the maps by using the in game currency for WINNING games , not completing them . ( Don't worry , there are no "" gems "" paid currency , it's all earned only through game time ) You'll be able to gift your nobles "" friends "" points as well . However , items such as helmets , armor types and other goodies ( think of nice armor effects like in halo reach ) are not purchasable until you buy that season package . there will be a plethora of helmets and rare helmets to unlock with in game points that don't require a season package if you're worried about that . New ones will potentially be added off season , in addition to the community helmet ( voted design ) . The game is steam integrated , but will not support trading or monetary value of virtual items of any kind . ( Cancer ) . So back to the new maps : Players are able to continue playing the game normally as any other player can . There are no item unlocks that change a players ability . When a new season comes out , they might not be able to play the new maps right away if they haven't grinded enough points to buy the map pack . This works to ensure players that don't have the money can still play the updates , and keep the population alive as well . By time the new season has been out for a week or so , I'll have the mathematical formula for game points / time played at a sweet spot that will allow non buyers to receive the new maps in <NUMBER> days ( <NUMBER> hours ) of game time . So naturally the only thing non buyers will miss out on is the new map launch , ( bonus XP lol ) and the character customizations ( you'll want them ) . In addition to all of this , after the season is about to end , the maps will be released for free in the server browser , but you'll have to purchase them if you want to play custom games in them . I've already shared too much , but I've been drinking and I'm excited to tell a bit more . Fair reminder that this system has not been placed into any part of the game yet ( about <NUMBER> days of work ) , but all the virtual items and customizations have been created for the first season . So some subjects are due to change , but I promise that there will never be an inclusion of micro transactions , or any player disadvantage ever , or player base split . I'm making this game as a game I want to play . I'm not greedy , I'm hungry for a good game and fun community . So more about the community design ( something I'm excited about ) . On our website , every season we will have a contest where people can submit a design of a particular helmet idea they want to see included in the game . They'll get to name it , and be the first to wear it for a week . Depending on the population size it will get out of hand fast , so I have plans on introducing forum clans that will be able to come together as a group and make a helmet the represents their clan . Once it's been decided by the community staff , I'll have my character artists create the helmet in Maya with a little of a professional touch to make sure it fits well with the model , and easily add it in game with a small update . This is something I'm really excited about as building a community together . There will be restrictions to some of the designs and names obviously , and in some cases it might not always be a helmet , but perhaps a map scenario idea . Not only do I want people of all ages to have fun and interact , but perhaps a gateway in building interest for game design . Anyways , you'll see updates on this sub from me from time to time soon , and I'll eventually have my website up and ready when we hit an alpha stage . I said I won't have "" early access "" so the alpha will be very closed , but open to members of this subreddit because y'all are my homies and the community here is perfect for this type of game . And fear not , Without saying too much , your computer will be able to run it almost perfectly if you've been gaming since <NUMBER> . Console players ... maybe one day . It's a stylized look , and throws all preconceived notions of level and character design out the window ."	EXP

Compare how many people drive a car compared to how many people live in that neighborhood . Wrong the answer is biology . Twin studies prove that behaviors is more biological then environmental .

2899	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

I'm only here for the uncensored news lol . I'll reply to your post but I presume you will disagree with me .. First off , I didn't realize they had demanded that already so thank you for correcting me . Secondly , his "" negative relations with Israel "" cannot have been overblown because they have not even been mentioned : Soros ' e-mail leaks have been completely omitted or covered up by the corporate owned media . As there has been zero coverage of this story it can not possibly have been overblown nor exaggerated and it seems like you just assumed it was "" overblown "" that up to justify the next portion of your rant . Okay , as to the rest , I honestly don't know what to say . Are you arguing that Israel wants to kill all white people ? Do you have any proof of this claim ? I am willing to entertain your argument , but I hope you understand that this seems completely batshit insane to anyone not initiated into the ideology or the culture of this sub lol . Do you have any leaked intelligence or Israeli government documents about this plan ? Or any evidence at all , because I'm very interested in reading it . As two your final two sentences , I believe them to be correct , but this is not exclusive to Israel ( although they do have a particularly ruthless intelligence and security establishment ) but is standard practice of all states and securiy organizations since the beginning of recorded history . The principle objective of any state is survival of the state and as the Palmerstonian principle goes , states have no perpetual allies or enemies , merely perpetual interests , so obviously Israel will make pacts with anyone , just like every other country , like Britain , who Lord Palmerston was referring to , or the US . US history is suffused with making pacts with literally any pro-US or anti-Soviet regime , forcing the nation to adopt the Washinon consensus , open up their markets to American corporations , draining them of their natural resources via oil / mining / agriculture corporations and then ditching them when they're of no use . Israel does have a long history of false flags against the US but you are implying that the US has no agency in its close relationship with the Israelis . There are important strategic reasons the US allied with Israel openly after the ' <NUMBER> war and used them as an offshore stabilizer in the Near East , as well as other reasons why they have maintained this relationship , which includes an important relationship between their intelligence agencies ( involving CIA hotshots like James Jesus Angleton and Ted Shackley ) . Anyway , your entire post seems predicated on the idea that states behave morally or immorally ... most people in the realist camp of international relations would argue that states are amoral in the realm of foreign policy and advancing their national interest , neither the US nor Israel deviate much from this principle ."

3181	dating_advice	"Attraction is pretty simple and pretty binary : it either is or isn't . There's no such thing as the friend-zone . Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ? "" Because they've learned to be guarded with guys lest their friendliness be mistaken for attraction . Or maybe this girl is just really open . Or maybe she actually just genuinely likes you as a human being ! You're not her emotional boyfriend ; she's your emotional girlfriend . You cutting her off might hurt her , but she'll survive and she'll date and otherwise get over it . For you , it will definitely hurt because you have the most to lose . That's why she's your emotional girlfriend . You're stuck in an awkward point in your dating timeline . It's going to suck getting through this , but you need to focus on things you can control . The only thing you can control here is you . Focus on yourself and getting as healthy as possible . Invest everything you have into yourself . Go to the gym , read self-help books , meet new people , find a therapist , pick up that hobby you've been putting off , go travel , have fun with your friends , learn how to be at ease with yourself , but stretch yourself as much as you can . You'll learn more about yourself , you'll learn how much you're capable of , and you'll learn what you like and what you're good at and what sort of people you don't like . It's the knowledge of these things that gives us confidence to take bold steps in our relationships , and that confidence in turn radiates attractiveness to others . Focus on yourself .

This has nothing to do with police unions , fraternal organizations or the blue line , it has to do with the law . The reason most police organizations do not offer this or require this is because they simply do not have the money to do it . Budgets are stretched thin as is . I would also like to be clear in case anyone thinks I might have sympathy for these fucking hams . Fat officers are an absolute disgrace to the uniform and should be rooted out . There is no excuse for being fat . Just because you sit in a car and have easy access to fast food does not mean it is ok to be a planet .

In this regard the individual language of each and every human are akin to native american tribes whose land has been invaded by culture writ large . Through this invasion medicine is given but slavery is also introduced , slavery which demands ever-further inroads into the individual's core . The labels of racist are only one example of culture's demand that the individual's unconquerable essence temper and submit itself to the external agent . The core of every individual shall be supported and buttressed against culture writ large , so that like a menagerie every individual may grow to their fullest . The individual before the machine , and the machine at its root only to the support of the life , prosperity , and freedom of each individual bar none . When you label me a racist you rob me of status within the machine ... a machine which has lost its way and must be reassembled into the new form . The new form which denies the killing , torture , and mental enslavement of any individual on the planet and places the cessation of these atrocities as its highest function . All other designs are bereft of their status . There will only be one monoculture , and if you support in its inclusion the demand for inroads into the individual psyche you will see such designs fail as they are replaced by the design outlined here .

3668	europeannationalism	I am from an Eastern Europeean country where the problem with migrants and refugees is not that major yet . However , this certainly does not mean that we shouldn't do anything , especially considering the state of the Western World . Most people in the country absolutely despise Muslim migrants , gypsies ( since there are many of them here ) and , of course , we are not big fans of Islam in general . However , most right-wing organizations in our country are just skinheads who have nothing new to offer , and they are simply promoting the same ideas - race war now , kill all shitskins , etc . This does not attract new followers , nor does it change anything ( apart from the fact that they beat up gypsies on a regular basis ) . This is why we decided to form a new organization which features primarily people from our country , but we are also attracting members from outside of our nation . Last month we met a Dutch guy who came across our stickers in the streets and joined our Discord channel , and in a few weeks we are meeting a guy from the U . S . who's going on an European trip and decided to visit our city after he had a chat with us . While most of the founders of our project share the far-right believes of the skinheads in our country , we realize that this is not the way to attract more people on our side . That's why we are taking a more subtle approach that will allow us to have conversations with ' regular people ' who are still uncertain whether they should lean to the left or right side of things . Apart from the stickers we are distributing around the city , we also make sure to clean up our streets from any leftist stickers , art , etc . We also may or may not take care of some Jewish monuments , portraits of Che , ( ( ( Marx ) ) ) , etc . These is the first batch of stickers we ordered - <URL> These are the translated variants , the ones we put up on the streets are in Cyrillic , but we'll also order an English batch to pair with them . As you can see , the stickers are not that harsh , and we are hoping that this will attract the attention of not just the far-right people , but of the ' average person ' . One of the guys in our organizations also provided us with some less-friendly stickers that we are distributing , but not associating our name with . We thought people like us were needed because as of recent years , more and more go to some of the Western countries for their bachelor's degree , and they end up being brainwashed into believing the liberal ideas . We hope that our presence will at least slightly reduce the number of people who end up falling for the white genocide propaganda being pushed in our faces on a daily basis .	EXP

So did the soviets ... they were going to have moon bases and futurelaser technology , but at the end of the day it turns out they couldn't even manage baking enough bread and keeping people from freezing to death . & nbsp ; That's all this crap is , smarter and smarter Harvard economists trying to take the spirit of Marxism and lace it with just enough laissez-faire so that it doesn't explode like the Nedelin disaster right out of the box .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

4887	fatpeoplehate	Hey - this is wrong . That's the force acting on them as they go down - try converting the potential to kinetic , because absorbed energy at impact is what will hurt . Treat them as a COM like you did in this , then convert their potential energy to kinetic at ground level - remember their gut holds them about a foot off the ground . Also , this assumes that all their energy goes back into themselves as they drop like dead weight - no energy lost to friction with stumbling . Finally , this extra energy is in fact dispersed in the giant volumes of low density material that they are coated in - so , yes , shitlords are less likely to survive a fall from any height . Tall enough falls , end the fatass would have a lower terminal velocity to boot .

With <NUMBER> million Uyghurs ( <NUMBER> million Chinese Muslims , <NUMBER> million Xinjiang inhabitants ) and estimates in the ' tens of millions ' for Falun Gon ( just Wikipedia , no doubt robust statistics on this one are problematic ) I don't think the size argument holds much weight . To include the global Muslim population is weird , unless you're saying Muslims are travelling towards China to wage Jihad amongst their Chinese brothers . But if you allow for that pool of radicals then it should be allowed to frame Islam as a global religion . Something which doesn't work very well considering we completely lack one , just one good example of a majority Muslim nation performing well on the Human Rights index . The age argument for radicalization , that I buy . And that's what my point boils down to . As long as China regrettably doesn't tolerate far meaker and agreeable ( and more widespread within it's borders ) religions like Falun Gon , like Buddhism , then Islam certainly doesn't get to play the victim card here . What may be even more depressing is that Xinjiang may even be an example of place with a ( close to ) Muslim majority without immediately turning into a theological backwater . Suggesting that Islam needs that iron fist to not degrade into religious rule of law . Though if you know a good example of a Muslim nation that has no such issues then by all means prove me wrong ( or tell me to go fuck myself I don't mean to bait you once more ) .	EXP

Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it .

5205	uncensorednews	"In a twisted sense these Muslims do have a plan for world peace . They know that terrorism is unpleasant , just as soldiers in Europe know that patrols in an enemy land is unpleasant . They have faith that when a caliphate rules over America , everyone can finally be at peace . They didn't leave their country looking to leave the fighting , they left their country to bring the fighting from there to here . Muslims are the ones who are instigating the fighting , The Qua'ran and mohammad taught them this . Play the victim while constantly making peace , then terrorizing the infidels . So your logic is itself manipulated by their Taqiyya . It's not a case where Muslims don't realize they are being a burden on the infidels . They know that their shrines to Mecca and Sharia law government buildings ( Mosques and islamic cultural centers enforcing religious law ) , they know full well that the western countries they are invading don't want them there . Taqiyya and Jihad of the pen and jihad of the tongue is about maintaining that red herring that poor Muslims are innocent and just trying to be as peaceful and loving as they can , by doing what they do best , being muslims . That's the problem , it's like a soldier from an enemy country is actively cutting down your door with an Ax , and he's got a little hole he can peek through , and through it they shout that you're not being "" understanding enough "" , you're just being an Islamophobe , you're not letting me set up a shrine in your kitchen to my Ax collection . This isn't a case of a mis-understanding among Muslims . This is a case of a mis-understanding among infidels . If you let these Muslims build more Mosques and Sharia government centers in Europe and America , those will be the places where the next big terrorist events are planned and organized and carried out by moderate muslims who hear the call of Mohammad and Allah and convert to Radical Muslims . The solution is forcible classification , verification , asset collection and debt / asset liquidation / consolidation , deportation and transferral of their assets back to Mecca so they can warship their Allah and Mohammad in one of the peaceful countries within a thousand miles of Saudi Arabia ."

People from Europe wanted to get away from the church so bad that they loaded there entire families on a boat came to the new world with their same bullshit religion and killed a bunch of God damn natives . The religion has systematically went around the world and destroyed cultures and traditions . If you follow Christianity to the letter it will lead to nothing but murder and suffering and goes against nature on almost every level . It's unfair to the people that have died throughout the centuries over this dog shit religion to just say oh some people in the church done some good . Without religion you can still do great things and good for the people but if you're a true believer in your religion and you follow it to the letter and it leads to murder in suffering much like it has throughout history then its fucking bullshit and it is evil and causes people to do evil things and has a throughout history . There is no denying it it's written in the blood of the people who died . People can be good without Christianity but following it to the letter lead you to murder and suffering . If you can tell me that following the Bible completely to the letter does not lead to suffering and murder then we will say it's not an evil force but I know you cannot say that because that would be a full blown lie because it does say that shit .

But she managed to get herself out for a stroll each day and do se work in the garden . But despite that , she did not get fat . Because she ate like a bird .

Whenever I'd see her with her similarly-aged friends , she was consistently in the best shape of her group . Now that she's on daily synthetic hormones , she has a ton more energy and has slimmed down in those problem areas without changing her ( already good ) habits . So , yes , thyroid issues can have a real impact on energy levels and calorie burn . And , yes , it's easier to drop weight and keep it off if you have a functioning thyroid .

5377	uncensorednews	I hear you , a lot of people haven't been exposed to that kind of epidemic . However a closer inspection by the medical community reveals that people don't really ' OD ' on cocaine but have long term cardiac disease , similar to fried chicken . The majority of deaths in the cocaine trade , by FAR , is violence between drug sellers . Heroin is a horrible evil addiction and overdosing is a real possibility . However many overdoses occur because of the wide spectrum of potency . Some heroin is so supplemented with other ( dangerous ) stuff that the user barely gets high ; and some is so powerful it will kill the user . Not knowing the potency of the drug is what leads to many overdoses . There are also the many longer term health effects of intravenous heroin use , often caused by sharing needles and using poor venipunture technique . A heroin user with a steady supply of consistent heroin who uses good aseptic technique can live a long time ( William Burroughs ) , not that that seems like a happy life . My point is that if you really hate the deaths and lives wrecked by drugs close inspection will reveal their illegality is a leading factor . Sometimes hating drugs so much leads us to hate them at the expense of saving lives . That is what's happening in America .	EXP

Except they don't , if you read it you would know this Except I did . The reason for originally being taken off air and for being permanently taken off air were decisions made by two different groups of people . Reading comprehension is hard for you I guess . You literally proved my point for me , it says that obscenity was not the grounds for his punishment . So you admit that the case has no bearing on "" obscene language "" that you are claiming the college student made . Glad you agree finally . Nope . His argument was that the original punishment did not include "" obscene language "" but the school later added it on . And the Supreme Court sided with the school . They are completely separate . There are many things you can do in college that you can not in high school . You are simply refusing to acknowledge this since your entire argument is based on court cases with high school students . There are different guidelines and rules , no matter how much you want to say their isn't you are wrong . No dipshit , their constitutional rights to not change when you graduate high school . Show me one single precedent for this . And who exactly decides this ? The FCC . My god you are dumb . The FCC does NOT have jurisdiction over what is or is not a violation of a person's freedom of speech . They only enforce previous decisions on what is or isn't allowed in the constitution . They do not get to interpret the speech on their own . Otherwise known as unsubstantiated bullshit . You are showing how little you actually know . Yeah , that's why I said it was likely a conduct violation . They were not at the school , they were in a public forum . No matter how you try to approach this it is simply a fact . The FCC is the authority in this situation . Yes , they were . How are you so wrong on such basic shit ? It's a UNIVERSITY radio station on the UNIVERSITY campus using UNIVERSITY facilities and equipment . So you have no proof of anything you are trying to say , interesting . As far as the conduct violation , no . It was a guess . A public student is a public student , regardless of the level of education . Wrong again . You know you actually have to provide proof for that , right ? Your proof only works if high school and college are considered the same . They are not . If you are going to spout bullshit at least have the sources to back it up , otherwise you just look like a moron . Says the guy who has provided no sources showing university students and high school students have different first amendment rights . Come to think of it , have you provided any sources whatsoever ? So that means that you just called yourself a moron . Good job , bud . Still a fact that using the word tranny was not the reason he was removed . Debates have never been the lefts strong suit , stick with finding new ways to look idiotic since you guys are very good at that . That is demonstrably the reason why they were originally taken off air . “ And so for today I am going to have you stop your show . Specifically tranny . That is a hate slur it is not allowed on radio . I need you to leave . ” As she says these words , a campus police officer stands in the background , the video shows "" The only way you would win this debate is if I got tired of reading your retarded bullshit lies and unsupported claims ."

6017	IWantToLearn	"^ Excellent intro to philosophy . Also If you want to go chronologically , For Western Philosophy : look into the pre socratics then Aristotle and Plato Augustine Berkely , Locke , Hume Hobbes Heidegger Kant Hegel Nietsche - - read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus ' The Orestia , Sophocles ' Oedipus Cycle , and Euripides the Bacchae . Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

6259	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

6278	uncensorednews	Thousands of mentally ill soldiers get kicked out of the military every year for misconduct . Micah Johnson was nothing special until his attack in Dallas .

He would only have received bare-bones training on small unit tactics and marksmanship . Clearly he had enough to kill cops from a distance from a defendable area . f the military had followed through with legal action , Johnson would have received a general discharge or an other than honorable discharge and would still be allowed to legally purchase a firearm But that is what I said , they need to bar anyone not honorably discharged from owning guns . We can't be training professional soldiers and the unleashing them on society with access to weapons when they have mental health or behavioral issues . The military needs to take responsibility .

6280	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

6351	hockey	"I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement : "" In short , it is illegeal specifically ... "" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

She banned a guy for asking "" how did historians arrive at the six million number , "" I'm not kidding or making that up . The sort of consensus that you've seen , in such an environment , is by design , not by neutral historians following evidence . The Soviet Union was being extremely aggressive in its foreign policy in <NUMBER> , particularly , and of course completely escaped blame for splitting up Poland with Germany in <NUMBER> , while Germany apparently deserved to be destroyed for it . The Winter War against Finland everybody knows , but the annexation of the Baltic states , Bessarabia and North Bukovina , and Vyacheslav Molotov's demands at a subsequent meeting with Joachim von Ribbentrop and Hitler made it apparent to Hitler at least that the Soviets were intent on bullying a Germany weakened from the Battle of France into concessions that would have doomed its oil supply , and future ability to defend itself . All this is completely overlooked in the leadup to World War II . Whereas everybody is aware of Germany "" taking over the world "" ( as if the British and French had not already done so ) by peacefully reclaiming and occupying German speaking lands it held before World War II in the Rhineland , Bohemia , Poland , and the Anschluss , which was merely a lesser realization of Großdeutschland delayed by <NUMBER> years , and welcomed by its population , nobody pays the slightest mind to the Soviet Union spreading communism westward toward Europe ; there was no Munich Conference for it , no discussion whatsoever about what all this portended , despite the tens of millions dead from the Russian Civil War , the Kronstadt Rebellion , war communism , the Five Year Plans , collectivization , the Holodomor , the Great Purge , compared to ... broken glass of store windows from Kristallnacht . The composition of many of the commissars forcing peasants onto kolkhoz while deporting so-called "" kulaks "" as revenge for Kishinev and other pogroms , and that of the victims of the Night of Broken Glass , and the international press , make the reasons for this valuing of a stubbed toenail over a genocide abundantly clear . Without looking , I'm sure they'll talk about the Five Year Plans , how Stalin said they had to advance <NUMBER> years in <NUMBER> , Stalin's freakout after Barbarossa launched . What they won't talk about is Hans-Ulrich Rudel and others ' observations of Soviet positions , which were curiously extended far westward in positions that would have made zero sense for defense in depth . That's the problem with that sub and establishment historians , they determine the parameters of the discussion before it even begins . With the growth and dominance of the Holocaust Industry , taxpayer-funded Holocaust museums , Israel and the U . S . ' s special relationship , and the overwhelming presence and influence of Jews and Jewish ideas in History Departments , all this is simply a taboo subject , or as close to such as to make a pariah of even a Jew like Arno Mayer , though he of course has seen his prospects remain in a better state than , say , Germar Rudolf . This can be seen all the way down to even petty censorship on internet fora like reddit , where asking questions and looking into a topic is grounds for being silenced . Not for the Holodomor , not for the Bengal famine , not for the Taiping Rebellion or the Great Leap Forward , only for one topic , and the suffering of one people . Any deviation from the gospel ( except when the Auschwitz and Majdanek museums do it , or "" functionalists "" like Christopher Browning ) is to be seen as wrong , it's an article of faith that "" Holocaust Denial "" is a monolith of deviance that is to be pathologized , and its uniform adherents to be slandered , fired , and humiliated , when not imprisoned outside the U . S . Understanding this bizarre climate is key to understanding why you've got the responses that you have . Rather than listening to those spin doctors and their pre-ordained conclusions , just listen to Hitler himself discuss the run up to Barbarossa , his reluctant decision to launch it over the objections of his generals , and the massive tank buildup which had been going on in the Soviet Union and directed at western Europe . Really interesting bit of history , he was secretly recorded talking with Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim , the great Finnish general , on a train in <NUMBER> , [ right here . ] ( <URL> Be very careful on looking to wikipedia for anything accurate , especially regarding the Holocaust . Like most major media of information , there are people behind the scenes making sure that a very ... [ favorable interpretation ] ( <URL> is put forward , from their perspective . It's ultimately as reliable as talking to a guy on the street . It's not a crazy conspiracy , not by estherke , or those wikipedia editors , or the media , it's just people looking out for their own people's interests . All it means is that it takes an extra level of looking into things , because there can sometimes be a deliberate veil placed between us and the truth .

If you think that we sit around regurgitating information without looking at every single source critically , than it's plainly obvious you haven't the slightest clue what occurs in a university setting . Unlike you , I've read hundreds of books and papers , reviewed thousands of documents , and read the "" academic "" works of your heroes like David Irving , Kevin MacDonald , Mark Weber , David Duke , etc . That includes actual academic works by the likes of Norman Finkelstein and Arno Mayer . If Night is the only piece of Holocaust literature that you've heard of , I'd say that you're at best a Junior League Single A neo-nazi . It befits someone of your world view to think that the only work anyone studies is the most famous one , and nothing else besides that . Now , to address your points . <NUMBER> . Citing works by Jews does not make anything less reliable . Only a low level racist and anti-semite believes there is a mass conspiracy made up of millions trying to change the public and academic discourse on the Holocaust . But I'll play your game . Some other prominent non Jewish Holocaust scholars include Richard Evans , Franklin Littell , Christopher Browning , Peter Longerich , Ian Kershaw , Richard Overy , Elisabeth Maxwell , Yves Ternon . The list literally contains hundreds of non-Jewish scholars . Being that you cite Night as your be all , end all Holocaust source , I will take it you don't know who these people are and I would refer you to Amazon or Wikipedia before you hit save on your inevitable reply . <NUMBER> . You are incorrect , your beloved race based anti-semitism is a belief only by Hitlerists , I'm sure some of your friends here would be happy to explain Strasserism to you in more depth . National Socialism can only be adopted by any country because Rockwell decided as much . True National Socialism is fervently against internationalism and speaks for only the German people .

I'm happy to provide you with the documents you speak and will answer any and all questions you may have . I am curious , however , as to why the testimonies Hoess and Eichmann are irrelevant ? Or Hitler's numerous speeches and works ? Is it because they lack physical proof and rigor , or because they are inconvenient to your POV ? Again , your lack of history training shines through with this little list , since obviously a speech and sworn testimony aren't classified at the same type of source . Your conflating of primary evidence and supporting evidence only adds to your confusion in all things related to this topic . So , now on to your documents . Please send me your email address in message , since the thousands of documents that exist cannot be put into a single post . But here are some things to whet your appetite . There are English descriptions since I'm sure , as a proud American National Socialist and a poor speller of German words , you don't speak any other language besides English : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> . .

7269	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

If you have experienced this , it is all your own fault for going through with a sexless marriage and not maintaining a manly relation . If not , you are even more hopeless .

There are a number of "" rough patches "" that are very localized . So , big plants , shutting down and a few hundreds of people get fired . Sometimes , some newer industries , and younger businesses are able to transition very rapidly and lay off a bunch of people , but most industries will go a few companies and markets at a time ( <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years as opposed to <NUMBER> + for some older , union-heavy much more established industries , think uber who can drop you in an instant and for free vs a union trucking job who have severance packages and billions of dollars invested in their current infrastructure ) . I'm not saying it's going to be unicorn la-la-land , there are people who will lose their jobs , ad there will be people who have been working <NUMBER> + years only doing one thing and they are now out of a job , and are too old to get hired and trained very easily . But , the reality is that the majority of people are going to benefit . The rich are not going to have robots making their fast food , they are going to have nice restaurants staffed with handsome waiters wearing expensive clothing because they want the "" experience "" . It's the working and middle class people that are going to benefit from how cheap shit is gonna get because of the new technologies . It's not necessary that the new jobs will require more and more training . If there is a huge supply of unskilled untrained laborers looking for work , supply and demand dictate that they will be doing something which previously did not have enough demand to justify the cost . For example , nobody will pay you , an unskilled worker $ <NUMBER> an hour to sharpen pencils . The reason is that I can make way more money paying you <NUMBER> an hour to make burgers . But , now , I have the machine making the burgers , and it would be a waste of money to pay you make the burgers . ( not relevant , but this is called the law of comparative advantage ) So , since I still want to make a profit , I'll have you sharpen the pencils or some other stupid bullshit . The only thing that you should legitimately be scared of is the minimum wage . Right now , automation technologies are getting cheaper and cheaper , and if the trend continues , the transition will be slow and industry specific , because the different technologies for the different industries will take a while to develop and that research is being done by different companies .

7807	Fitness	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

7850	fatpeoplehate	"That's not what I mean . I agree you have always had a no tolerance policy . What I mean is that your definition of "" sympathize "" , for example , is not well defined and there are a wide range of instances in which most people wouldn't consider a certain thing to be "" sympathizing "" but the moderators here do think the word fits and so you apply the no tolerance policy to these questionable instances . That's what I meant when I said "" the moderators have widened their definition of things like what it means to sympathize ' with a fattie "" . Do you remember the Simpsons episode in which Homer is recalling an instance , as a child , in which other children wouldn't let him into their treehouse ? They called their club the "" No Homers Club "" . When little Homer pointed out that they let another kid in with the name Homer they claim that it's the No HomerS Club so they are allowed to have <NUMBER> Homer . In this instance , the joke is transparent . They want to exclude Homer Simpson from the club but when they are questioned on their inconsistency in applying the rules , they appeal to an alternate interpretation of the club name in order to make it seem like they are applying the rules strictly and fairly . In reality , it's clear that they don't really care about having a club in which they only have <NUMBER> Homer . The reality is that they made up the club as a way of excluding Homer Simpson and they are intentionally reading the club name in such a way so as to get what they want . That is what I'm accusing the moderators of . I think the moderators really enjoy banning people for being fat or sympathizing with fat people . I think they enjoy drawing a hardline on fatties . As such , I think the moderators look for any opportunity to dish out their harsh justice . The problem is , like the No Homers Club , achieving that goal sometimes requires the moderators to appeal to a reading of someones comments which aren't reasonable . The moderators are intentionally widening the range of things they will count as a violation of the rules so that they can drop the ban hammer early and often . While I understand the appeal , I'm arguing that this has unintended and undesirable consequences . Mainly , it too narrowly homogenizes the comments as members seek approval form other members and try to dodge rule violations which , as you rightly point , offers no leeway ."	IMP

You're close to the average , so no worries Clinical programs tend to be more like medical programs than do other psych programs - they're more about the numbers . So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US .

8880	nazi	No not all Nationalsocialists are cowards . Many nationalsocialist men did do heroic acts . Not like Stalin who got <NUMBER> medals never steping on a battlefield . Why does it matter how he died ? I dont think you would have done any better . Even if he did not fight , he already had . During WW1 he got a medal . It is even said that missed the war . That is not something I came up with but it is said very often about Hitler . Communism failed and was even worse of a failure . Because many more died and over a billion people had to suffer the consequences . There is no doubt that Communism is the greatest crime in history . It can not even compare to Nazism . The reason why Capitalistic countries and Communists allied . Was because of Jews role in power . <NUMBER> % of the communist party were Jewish . When they saw a resistor . Jews gathered and started fighting against Nazism . This brings up an other point of course you would be scared if almost the whole world was fighting against you . Also if the Jews stamped it out . Why am I here and many others who share ideas ? No it was not crazy science that Hitler talked about . It was the truth that he spoke about . That humans are different and that some are better than others . Now this might have gone to far for my liking . But Communists were worse they denied this and made it worse for everyone . The one who came up with the concentration camps . He was a genius because that was communism in a nutshell . No pay for work . Everyone is treated the same . If you are a communist you must be exterminated . It is your lifes purpose . To bad that slavic men died that were not communists . This is very sad : , ( these men could have done great things instead of fighting for Jews . The Nazis deathtoll get even smaller because Germans who killed Slavs did not kill them . It was the Communists who did by taking power . If this never would have happened . The Tsar and Hitler would have gotten along greatly . The communists killed the brightest minds taking Russia back in time so they could have control . Now look at the Russian demographics . Whites are dying out ! : , ( Even Alexander Solzhenitsyn agrees with me . He was awarded the Nobel prize . Good that one bright mind survived to tell the horrors . When the elder generation dies in Russia it is time for Nationalsocialism . The Aryan thing was because he wanted the best for his people which he regarded as a family . He said that the greatest gift was his folk . This means of course he is trying to make his own stronger . But this is a principle for others to . Not just for Aryans , but others races . He of course wants the youngsters to get what the older generation had buildt . To carry on a legacy . Would you not want to inherit something your elders gave you . He just did not want the destruction of what he had built so he went to far to protect it . So he was good but not good enough . But better than the Jews .	EXP

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

It's brilliantly well-done for an indie multiplayer game . I also forgot to mention that there is a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic when it comes to classes and the special types of zombies . For example , Berserker classes ( specialty is melee ) don't want to get too close to a Scrake or Flesh Pound ( both have high health and attack power ) , these enemies would probably be best dealt with by a Support Specialist ( shotguns ) or Commando ( automatic weapons ) , so you can strategize your team's class setup .

What's disturbing is that I've only heard of one couple doing this . I don't judge people for being into something weird - you don't get to decide what gets you off - but I do judge them if they do something unethical because of what gets them off .

9359	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

I also had a nearly perfect hourglass figure by <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . I had strong muscular legs , and I literally had the perfect body for a girl five years older than me . So , when I was in fifth grade , my older cousin Rich was graduating from high school in my district . He was a popular football player from an unusually successful iteration of our school's football team . He had a lot of friends . As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation , there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends . I was <NUMBER> years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure .

10313	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

10316	aww	Ah ! Petland and others of their ilk always end up luring me inside as well , despite my better judgement . When I was quite young , I had farmer neighbors up the road who kept a handful of rabbits in hutches . Once , they took them out of the hutches one by one and let me hold and pet them . Fortunately I was too young then to comprehend their eventual fate , or I might have led a lapine insurrection . When I was about twelve , I went to the county fair and saw a booth where they had rabbits for sale , including this huge specimen for $ <NUMBER> , probably a Flemish Giant or Chinchilla , in retrospect , though specific details of appearance escape me . Anyway , I positively begged my mother to let me buy it with my accumulated allowance , but she refused ... wisely comprehending that I was more eager to possess the rabbit than to care for it . Glad to hear that you keep multiple rabbits ; given the social nature of most varieties ( and their relatively short history of domestication as house pets ) they are certainly far happier for the company than they would be alone .

10341	uncensorednews	Im on mobile so im not able to articulate my thoughts as much , but im going to do my best here . Im following you on pretty much all of your main points but where you lost me is where you mentioned using the word racist is a non-argument . I counter this by the fact that racism is defined by the use of racial slurs and sterotypes , so by my saying you are racist I am arguing that you fit into this category of people who act in this manner . I certainly dont think im more right than you , but by calling you a racist ( referring to your example ) im showing you that im taking a stance opposite to you , defined by my use of the word to separate my views from yours . ( Again in the exmaple because I dont know all of your ideas / views ) Surpirsingly enough I agree with much of what you said , but I disagree that my use of a certain word makes my argument invalid . I could have just as easily laid out a detailed rebuttal of why I believe you are racist , but I instead chose to use that specific word because by definition it supports my argument to do so . On the flip side I also see how there is a very thin line between arguing that someone is a racist , and using the word as a cop out as you put it . In the future ill make sure not to rely on the word alone to support my ideas , but I will continue to use it in discussion because I believe it does support those views .	IMP

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays .

What they tell the doctors cannot be faked [ unless they want to help dx you ] . Then there are the tests and observations over a period of time by the doctors / staff . Combine these and the interview of the person who claims to have it , then you have several barriers to facetious disorders and conditions . Then on an anecdotal level , why would I go through hell in every year in school except college ? Why and how could I fake clumsiness / sensory sensitivity probs when I was a child [ before the disorder was recognized ] ? I had misunderstandings every hour [ that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature ] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [ and other awkward attempts at being "" good "" ] ? Why would the doctors tell my parents that I was ALmost autistic [ after-all Asperger's is a milder form of autism ] when I was having those problems at elementary schools ? I had ALL of the characteristics a girl with Asperger's at that age would display , not something I could plan or make up like many of the people with facetious disorders do . Kids at kindergarten age do not have this facetious / Munchhausen's dz or at least they do not plan-out a life-long condition , they may pretend they have a boo boo but that's it . [ My mother did not want this and does not show any Munchhausen's-type symptoms or characteristic personality quirks like strong desire for attention ] . Just like the many other types of deniers , I think YOU have a reason to dislike these ideas associated with the mind . Therefore you deny it all and camp with the anti-psychiatry tribe . You are lucky to have the internet to get more confirmations of your belief as well as Scientology [ whose founder had it out for them too ] . Me , I had no idea about Asperger's while I was forced to be dx'd . I thot I had anxiety disorder and / or depression and OCD [ with out the compulsions to wash hands for eg . ] . My mother was devastated that they had treated the way they did when I was a kid ; my father is an engineer with similar characteristics [ and seems nonplussed about it ] . Neither of them had a desire nor idea at my age that I had Asperger's or an ASD . I do NOT see Asperger's as an excuse to be rude nor a justification for my past behavior [ merely a partial explanation ] . I believe like , Temple Grandin , that the ASD should not control a person ; that one should learn manners , have continual education and reviews of how to get along in the world with people . I frequently feel like I should be considered intellectually disabled [ in the past I would be called mentally retarded in some aspects ] because of the grief I have caused and continue to cause unintentionally - - most of it is misunderstandings on either side of the equation .

10957	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

Being in the middle gives them a lot more room for certain storylines and character development , so I think it could be a good thing . Given the people involved , it's pretty safe it at least won't veer left of center at all . Artwork already looks better if you look at some of the latest shading . Can still use some work , but it's getting there . My hope is this will be viable for long-term and also give other non-leftist voices encouragement to succeed in similar industries that have been taken over by SJW .

For the guys who fit the profile , they are essentially dating the inverse . Younger , shorter , weaker , dumber , and poorer . So what's left for the guy ? Looks . Again , I've made some pretty broad generalizations and assumptions , but it basically holds true that women value a broad set of characteristics in a man from the outset of meeting them , and men will place heavy value on a woman's appearance . These results aren't surprising , and you can see below that women are susceptible to similar behaviors when being deceived about different factors . <URL> <URL>	IMP

( WTHR ) - A Brown County church vandalized with Donald Trump graffiti shortly after the <NUMBER> election wasn't targeted by pro-Trump political activists , but a member of their own congregation , according to police . People suspected the KKK or some other hate group was responsible for the graffiti . The arrest of the church organist , was a surprise - and a relief . The Brown County prosecuting attorney's office issued a statement Wednesday saying they had charged <NUMBER> - year-old George Nathaniel Stang of Bloominon with institutional criminal mischief , a misdemeanor . Stang was the man who originally claimed to have found the graffiti , and works as the organist at St . David's Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom . "" Oh my , the organist , "" Mary Ayers said . "" The organist . Wow . Wow . "" It was November , shortly after the presidential election . Stang told everyone he discovered the graffiti when he arrived for Sunday morning services . The small Episcopal church is inclusive and welcomes gay couples . RELATED : Brown County church vandalized Detectives immediately suspected the crime was committed by someone familiar with the church . They said cell phone records put Stang in the area Saturday night . According to court records , when confronted with the evidence , the <NUMBER> - year-old gay man confessed . Investigators say Stang admitted to painting the "" Heil Trump "" and "" Fag Church "" graffiti himself because he wanted to "" mobilize a movement after being disappointed in and fearful of the outcome of the national election . "" He insisted his actions were not motivated by anti-Christian or anti-gay sentiments . Ron Smith , a Brown county resident , shook his head . "" Is there any rhyme or reason or sanity in any of this action ? "" Eyewitness News asked . "" I don't think , "" Smith said . Brown County Prosecutor Ted Adams talked about Stang's alleged motive . "" He explained that one of the reasons he had done it was because of fear . He was concerned about the results of the election , "" Adams said . In a three-page , handwritten statement , Stang , according to court records , wanted to "" mobilize a movement . "" "" I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good , even if it was a false flag , "" he wrote . "" To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation . I of course realize now , this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism . "" The hate crime hurt the community . Residents say it gave outsiders the wrong impression of Bean Blossom . Jody Boyd is relieved the mystery is apparently solved . "" Just knowing the hate crimes will be stopped here in Brown County , maybe things will be put to rest , "" Boyd said . If convicted , Stang could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined as much as $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> . Reached by phone Wednesday , he had nothing to say . The church had no comment on the arrest , but Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis Bishop Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows issued the following statement about the vandalism : I was saddened to learn this morning that the vandalism of St . David ’ s Church in Bean Blossom was committed by the church ’ s organist , Nathan Stang , who has admitted to police that he spray painted hateful graffiti on the church last November in the wake of the presidential election . This was a hurtful , dishonest , and profoundly misguided action that stands against the values of the people of this diocese and the Episcopal Church , and we will continue to cooperate with the authorities who are pursuing this case ."

11314	fatpeoplehate	"I just joined this subreddit yesterday , and never could I have imagined that I would find a topic I felt I HAD to comment on this soon after subscribing . This is a topic I have been dying to discuss openly , but is considered rather taboo in what people I know call the "" rare performance art community . "" I am a percussionist , and have been for about <NUMBER> years now . Started off learning Afro and Latin rhythms , and eventually became interested in Middle Easter rhythms . A group of us used to meet at a local park for sessions on Sundays . Now mind you , we weren't some hippie drum circle , we were made up of very skilled percussionists , some of which have been playing for over <NUMBER> years . In that group is one of my best friends , and my drumming brother . We are awesome playing off of each other and can communicate mid rhythm with just glances and nods . <NUMBER> years of playing side by side will do that to you . One Sunday , we were approached by two very fit and attractive girls , asking us if we would be interested in expanding our Mid East drumming knowledge and visit them during one of their belly dance practices . Of course , we agreed . We showed up , and these were by far the most physically fit women I have ever laid eyes on . You could shoot a cannon at their stomachs , and the cannonball would have shattered . Needless to say , we agreed to start working with them , and little did we know how much of a work out it would be for us . Those girls can shimmy and shake at speeds that are very difficult to keep up with on the drum . You see , belly dancers and drummers go hand in hand , and when you work together long enough , you end up forming a relationship that can only really be expressed through rhythm and dance . Each pop , ting , or bang I make on the drum is in turn mirrored by a movement in the dancers hips or stomach . Not only that , to play and dance to the tempo these rhythms are supposed to be played requires top physical shape , and a fairly strong tolerance for the pain of muscle cramps . For a couple years , we did great shows with these girls . Casino gigs , private corporate parties , etc . Both my drumming friend and I ended up each dating girls from the group , which made the experience of drumming for them that much more personal and rewarding . Everything was choreographed , and we were constantly pushing ourselves to the limit of endurance and speed . Then something horrible happened ... There teacher started offering "" casual "" courses for "" fitness "" reasons . I am sure she thought she would get some college girls that need to shed a pound or two of that freshmen beer weight , but what she got instead was a stampede of water buffalo . Obese women of all ages signed up , and since the teacher offered to pay my buddy and I to drum for the "" casual "" courses , we started helping out . It was horrible . Not just because I wanted to pull my eyes out , but because there was no challenge . Even after the girls learned the moves and practiced often , the simply could not hold up the the speed we were used to drumming at . Not only that , my friend and I weren't able to make out the specific and individual movements of their hips and bellies , which is often helps keep us on track with where we are in the song . After about a year , one of the moo cow girls quit and started teaching her own classes . From there , it spiraled out of control . More and more fat girls started belly dancing , and next thing we know , they are performing for free ( bc no one would pay them to see that shit ) in all sorts of places . Suddenly , people just didn't want to see belly dance at all . There were too many fat girls doing it , and people just quit reaching out to the belly dance community as a whole . As a result , it has been over <NUMBER> years since I have picked up my doumbek to play for a belly dancer of talent . It really sucks how fat girls have ruined it for the people that really took it seriously . You see , there are some things that physically fit dancers can do that the fat dancers simply cannot . Many of the moves are very subtle , and each hit of the drum is supposed to be mirrored by the subtle movements . When an obese dancer attempts this , one body movement is used for <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> or even <NUMBER> drum hits . Partially because they can't keep up with the speed , and partially because their fat jiggles , and masks any other movements they might be trying to make underneath all the blubber . Sure , you are "" supposed to have something to shake "" , but per the standards of M . E . drumming and belly dancing , the movements are ALL supposed to be visible in your muscles and bones , not in the flapping or your fat . Fat girls can claim all they want that this is a style of dance they have just as much right to do , but in reality , their bodies simply aren't cut out for it . Not only that , but because most of the teachers that work with the overweight girls won't push them to try , therefore they never get pushed enough to shed off the pounds . Most view their weight as a limiter , and not something that can be lost with the same hard work the fit girls put in . Holy shit . I had no idea that would be this long ... TLDR : I drummed for physically fit belly dancers . Fat belly dancers simply are not physically cut out to perform in the moves at the speeds the traditional dance style calls for ."	EXP

11357	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

Now there may be define bona fide relationships for other things such as federal benefits or something but that wouldn't have control over this issue . What you would say is that in instance X , Y , and Z we defined bona fide relationship this way and we should do so here . Notwithstanding that though the court will define for themself what bona fide relationship means for this legal matter .	EXP

11704	Christianity	Well , yes . As I see it , you either believe the bible , or you don't . When there is an apparent conflict , you have to somehow reconcile it . Either the bible is right , or it's wrong . I've encountered many difficult scriptures that seem to conflict with the obvious and have usually found upon deeper inspection that either my understanding of the obvious was wrong or I was not correctly interpreting scripture . Not everyone believes the bible literally . I do . I don't see any other way . To read it and take bits and pieces of it that satisfy you or fit your world view is to destroy the whole thing I think , or turn it into nothing more than a book of philosophy . I cannot do that . Many can , I cannot - it would be illogical . Now , because I came to conclude that our understanding of evolution is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the biblical account of creation , I've dived deeper and have discovered science that better fits my world view . You can see a lot of it at [ Answers in Genesis ] ( <URL> and and [ The Institute for Creation Research ] ( <URL> I recommend you check out those sites .

12088	OperationPullRyan	Statement by the President on H . R . <NUMBER> : Today I have signed into law H . R . <NUMBER> , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <NUMBER> . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over <NUMBER> pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section <NUMBER> affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> U . S . C . <NUMBER> note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the <NUMBER> AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section <NUMBER> confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section <NUMBER> ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section <NUMBER> ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the <NUMBER> AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section <NUMBER> seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section <NUMBER> is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section <NUMBER> provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section <NUMBER> provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past <NUMBER> years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

12105	atheism	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following : The training and certification that teachers go through . Thereby , the recommended teaching methods . The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability . A broad control over what gets taught , in the form of a curriculum . A teacher's conduct , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would you like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in general are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

12111	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself .

12460	uncensorednews	This points to an even worse problem : we took a massive amount of resources that could have made Africa a self-sufficient , competing nation national block with a high standard of living and we mismanaged almost every penny . Same for all sorts of foreign aid . I understand the impulse to help , but you need to start from first principles with these things . You can't just chuck money and tech into a society ; then it isn't theirs , and it gets misused or squandered . Start with the culture . What do they value ? How do you communicate ? How do they see their world and evaluate their quality of life ? Now , apply that to education . Don't just build schools , make sure kids can get to them . Make sure the teaching is effective , and give the kids easy access to information of all sorts for self-directed learning . Make sure it's communicated in a way that they can value within the scope of their own culture and experience . Next , set up small financial institutions . Design systems with existing , low-tech solutions to enable the flow of credit and debit . Raise small , family-owned institutions to do things like microcrediting and agricultural co-ops . Again , understanding the culture and social fabric is key to making this work . Who loans to whom , and for what reasons ? Are there certain protocols for settling financial disputes ? Make sure you marry that into the system , or at least put up some kind of interface to weld them together . Otherwise , in the best-case scenario , nobody uses it . At the same time , work with local farmers , elders , and craftspeople to develop more efficient agriculture and transport infrastructure for goods . Listen to the locals here , because they know the land better than you . Take that and mix it with a heavy dose of ecological engineering and sustainable techniques , the lower-tech the better . Toss the result to the kids and the local makers ; I've seen some truly brilliant solutions come out of that last step before implementation . Never underestimate a curious kid or a resourceful scrap metal artist . Finally , empower the populace to protect themselves from predation . Train them in basic self-defense , how to counter modern weaponry , and simple , tried-and-tested methods for defending their fields , families , and livelihoods . Throughout these things , approach each implementation through the people . Enable them to make the technologies , processes , and knowledge their own . If they own it , and they can see its power , they'll fight tooth and nail to keep their own from misusing it . They evolve with it , tinker with it , and most importantly , they preserve it for their children . When those newly-educated children get their hands in the game , they will surpass even the people who helped their fathers build their qanats and raise the first satlinks . - - - We could have given them the greatest gifts any young civilization could receive , if we had been a little wiser and a little more discerning . Instead , we threw money at the problem , and that mostly to virtue-signal ; half in arrogance , half in misplaced guilt , entirely in self-satisfied ignorance . Africa has promise . Resources , abundant solar exposure , and countless humans with unlimited promise . If they weren't hamstrung by the warring psychopaths among them and the constant fight for the absolute basics of survival , they might do well for themselves . Injecting raw cash into various systems isn't about to change that . It's the basics , the low-level stuff that's rarely funded , that gets things done . We meant well , but I wish we would have done better .	EXP

You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No .

Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force .

CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet .

I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst .

They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't .

I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people .

This explains precisely the problem with MOST people our age . You may think it's both peoples fault , father and mother equally , but I'm not saying everything I'm saying FROM HATRED OF WOMEN , that's absolutely not the source of it , try to listen to me here , I'm just OBSERVING WHAT IS GOING ON my emotions over the issue are irrelevant , I'm simply stating the facts as I see them . We can talk about guys being shitty fathers , leaving the woman with a child in her arms , but from what i can see , he's going to get fucked and she's going to be ok because he loses rights to custody and she gets a free bonus check , so why would a guy want to do that ? I've known plenty of guys that actively wanted to be a part of their child's life , however , yet were denied the opportunity and abused like an old tool into giving what they can't to someone they end up hating all for the sake of a child they will not even know , and a lot of the time some other guy gets called daddy . I'm not making this shit up , that's the system When have you ever heard of women paying child support to a stay at home dad ? it happens but it's like finding a unicorn . Women paying alimony ? fat chance that a woman would marry a guy below her salary to begin with . Single fathers are rare enough and when they exist a lot of times it's because the mother passed away in an accident or child birth or whatever else , sometimes women leave the man with a kid my brother in law had that happen to him but honestly other than in meth or black communities where women turn into junkies where does that happen . And my own disappointment in my mom is real but doesn't inform anything I'm saying , I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't recognize that it's as widespread as it is , my mom is a good example though , just another statistic in the USA where the nuclear family is now a minority , broken homes , divorce , single parenthood are now the norm . And as I said before , the woman decides when the family gets created . Before that child is born , it's all hunky dory , but bringing a child into the world that was created by a piece of shit thug or deadbeat loser , or conversely having a child and crushing the father with the system out of spite as so many women have done - again look at family court - is not a recipe for a strong society , and women again have total control over these things . You may not long for the life of a single mother and that honestly is a mark of your intelligence but let's be real , a lot of dumb girls especially in their teens and in poorly educated families get their hormones going and literally try to have children at young ages , they know they can resort to the Government if their boyfriend dips out , who is just a dumb kid like them , I've said before an older man will typically step up to bat and be a father , younger guys especially without father figures are more selfish than men who were instilled with dignity and honor , I mean I grew up in a <NUMBER> % white community and I still got to see dozens and dozens of girls get pregnant at my high school and end up dropping out , and plenty of guys I know were the unlucky dads who had a falling out with them and you guessed it - got half their $ <NUMBER> or so monthly income working during or after high school taken away . I know a guy that was paying $ <NUMBER> a month , and he had to bust his ass for <NUMBER> hours a week to make it . You may not believe in the wage gap , I've seen it first hand , most guys I knew growing up worked full time in high school , overtime , <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hour weeks , a lot of girls didn't even work and when they did it was part time at some mcjob while they sat pretty driving their daddy's car . I'm not saying this is genetic , this is generational , women from prior generations have my utmost respect and knew how to be women . Feminism really ate away at the core of society though and the "" empowerment "" of women was simply the death knell of western society as a whole ."	EXP

Many ex-smokers find that if they stop smoking for a year or two that the cravings subside . Quite a few actively hate the smell of smoke and find it repulsive . I'm sure you see where I'm going with all the above : We can't stop eating . We can try to eat healthier or eat less , but you can't cut it out and most people can't avoid being around others who eat . When I was younger I found the idea that people couldn't just manage their weight pretty difficult to understand and accept . Now that I'm in my 40s though ( and could stand to lose 20kg ) I can appreciate how difficult it can be . Yes , people are responsible for what they stuff down their gullets ( myself included ! ) and weight loss is actually an incredibly simple concept : Eat less , exercise more .

You're taught to think of anyone thinner as a negative , as something that simply isn't POSSIBLE for you , because you can't change your body without suffering through awful diets and laborious exercise . As someone who did Taekwondo as a smallfat , I HONESTLY thought that I'd never change because "" I must be burning all of these calories , but nothing is happening "" . And I sweat like a pig during my classes . Drills were rough for me when I weighed more . What I was fucking missing from the equation was that I was going to fucking KFC or eating double portions at home after a rough class and undoing all of my hard work . I do remember being extremely strong ( <NUMBER> + pushups and <NUMBER> + situps in a class , depending on the instructor ) but I still had that horrible layer of fat covering everything .

For FIVE seconds I accepted this new reality ... Then my inner shitlord brain reared its fearsome head and said : "" FUCK NO . I AIN'T ROLLING OVER "" .

13184	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

"" They want progression with gender roles , yet they sneer at it when it's truly represented . That's because those types ( not all feminists , just these types ) don't want progression , they don't want to talk about equality . What they want is to be accepted for how they are . These are the same types of feminists that cry about women being underrepresented in engineering , science , maths while they carry their liberal arts or gender studies degree that their dad paid for . If you think more women should be engineers , go be a fucking engineer ... don't shit on society for not meeting the expectations you yourself aren't willing to uphold . It's lazy .

It's very ridiculous . On that same point , when someone tells me that my body is not socially acceptable in one way or another , I don't scream about society and body acceptance . I just make a joke about it , usually something like , "" Oh no I added these muscles for you Now whatever shall I do ? "" and then I give a sarcastic glance . Do you like it when they look at you and you can see that you sicken them ? Yes , but only because they find "" female with muscle "" to be sickening , so I just take their "" OH GROSS "" response as "" YOU HAVE MUSCLE "" , and since I'm going for muscle I can't take offense to it . I usually just laugh as an immediate response because it's amazing people are so childish . Full disclosure : I'm not very good "" socially "" , I don't know what to call it other than that .

13276	milliondollarextreme	Although the extent to which these intellectual and political movements influenced gentile society cannot be assessed with certainty , the material presented is highly compatible with supposing that Jewish-dominated intellectual movements were a critical factor ( necessary condition ) for the triumph of the intellectual left in late twentieth-century Western societies . No evolutionist should be surprised at the implicit theory in all this , namely , that intellectual activities of all types may at bottom involve ethnic warfare , any more than one should be surprised at the fact that political and religious ideologies typically reflect the interests of those holding them . The truly doubtful proposition for an evolutionist is whether real social science as a disinterested attempt to understand human behavior is at all possible . This does not imply that all strongly identified Jewish social scientists participated in the movements discussed in the following chapters . It implies only that Jewish identification and perceived Jewish interests were a powerful motivating force among those who led these movements and among many of their followers . These scientist-activists had very strong Jewish identities . They were very concerned with anti-Semitism and self-consciously developed theories aimed at showing that Jewish behavior was irrelevant to anti-Semitism while at same time ( in the case of psychoanalysis and the Frankfurt School ) showing that gentile ethnocentrism and participation in cohesive anti-Semitic movements were indications of psychopathology .

As labor shrinks to a minimum out of the total costs of production , rent , capital and interest will make up the remainder of the income streams . Therefore the lower the labor costs in an economy , the greater the disparity between the purchasing power of the currency and labor-based income , as well as demand in general for that matter . TL ;D R - Even if automation drives labor to zero , the costs of business will remain non-zero , and therefore the reduction of labor costs by necessity only benefits those whose incomes are non-labor derived .

I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since <NUMBER> has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in <NUMBER> I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then .

I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy .

I'm kind of surprised that you got rubbed really wrong about my blog post where I followed down that line of thinking , but it was actually me thinking through my own reaction at the time . I hope I didn't come across like I was bitching about my friends as if we were sitting together at a cafe like I can't get over it . The situation was cause for thought for me and I thought it was cause for thought for others allowing an interesting discussion to open up . I'm unsure about your advice to : Instead of telling your friends to completely stop , you could have just as easily used what your friends were doing to give value to the entire restaurant . You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people . Perhaps I need to clarify , but the example I use in my article is happening in a sushi restaurant . It irritated me that my friends were acting out in a classy establishment . I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance , but in any case , it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person , in fact , part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values .

Its about the consequences for children who don't get a say in the matter . They're opposed to the well-documented implications that single-parent households have on long-term outcomes for children . You and I can argue all day about the moral implications of intentionally having a child as a single parent , but regardless of what conclusions we come to , we aren't arguing about the lifestyle of that person : we're arguing over the impact of their actions on a child who is dependent on them . It's not a sound one though , the treatment being offered is reversible and is there to prevent puberty largely taking hold until the individual in question is absolutely positive about which gender they wish to live as . Seems pretty reasonable to me , it's enabling choice for the child without making that choice final . It obviously seems reasonable to you , and that's fine . But you're one person who has made a decision about the efficacy of allowing children to dictate the timescale of their own biological maturity . This isn't a conversation that should just start and stop at "" welp , yeah that sounds reasonable .

EDIT : Also , the treatment being offered is reversible and is there to prevent puberty largely taking hold until the individual in question is absolutely positive about which gender they wish to live as . As contemporary identity politics has instructed us ad nauseam , "" sex and gender are completely uncorrelated . "" A genetic male can identify as a gender woman , no problem , full-stop . We have no justification for giving sex-changes to kids on the grounds that they identify as a different gender because , as we've been repetitiously told , gender is in no way dependent on sex . They have every ability to identify as whatever gender they wishw already . There's no need to let <NUMBER> year olds stunt their development so they can have time to "" figure stuff out .

Where agnostic really falls in is on the nature of God , what God's true will is , what Christ's true teachings were and if they were corrupted in translation , is the organised church good ? All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang . Not to mention the model of abiogenesis has to account for starting evolution , ie the first organism would have to be capable of reproducing and evolving . edit : grammar"	NOT

14727	sjwhate	"part <NUMBER> : WHY do you care ? denying the Holocaust can easily be proven to be willful ignorance Why does it matter whether people ignorant of this , given that people are ignorant of pretty much all history ? I know the answer : Because Nazis were super evil , and we need to remember that , to stave off the threat of this ultimate evil coming back . Lack of recognition of a threat is itself a threat . This is fine and I applaud you for trying to prevent future harm . What it is implying though , is that without the Holocaust , the Nazis wouldn't appear evil or dangerous enough to stop their return . The preceding statement is either <NUMBER> . ) false , because there is plenty of evil to point at to stave off future Nazism , which means "" holocaust denial "" is actually no threat at all because the evil will still be prevented regardless of belief in holocaust . Or , <NUMBER> . ) true ... which leads to two possibilities : a . ) the holocaust did happen and there is enough evidence to prove it , in which case "" holocaust denial "" is no threat because of the dominant view on the matter which people are strongly attached to combined with the overwhelming weight of evidence preclude it from getting traction . b . ) the Holocaust DID happen but there is NOT enough evidence to prove it . That is the only scenario under which "" holocaust denial "" is a threat . To make a decent case of "" holocaust denial "" being dangerous , it is necessary to say there is not enough evidence of to prove holocaust happened ... - - - CONCLUSION / TL ;D R : If one asserts that the discussion of holocaust is not irrelevant , either "" holocaust deniers "" should be given platform , resulting in them getting crushed by the evidence , or the "" holocaust acknowledgers "" are saying they don't have proof of holocaust - - actually echoing the "" denier "" stance Therefore , the only way to not effectively support "" holocaust denial "" is to advocate for the study and discussion of "" holocaust denier's "" arguments . You might respond to that argument with something like : "" Isn't it better to still assume the holocaust happened , even if we don't have enough evidence it happened ? Just to be safe from a future hypothetical holocaust ? It doesn't cost us anything to assume it was real . "" ... It actually HAS cost us a LOT , and it is going to continue costing us . The clearest example is current day Germany . What happened was largely made possible by Germans being conditioned with guilt and self-loathing over the Holocaust . part <NUMBER> : EXTRA There's no confusion about whether or not it happened Tell me , what percentage of people who accept the narrative of Holocaust are know a a lot about it , beside some buzzword assertions like "" gas chambers "" , "" ovens "" , "" <NUMBER> million Jews murdered "" or can only cite evidence that doesn't directly corroborate the holocaust story like "" there were piles of starved-looking corpses after the war "" ? I would say over <NUMBER> % . Are those people , who are merely repeating assertions , not ALSO ignorant ? ... Now to the people who actually aren't ignorant , the historians ... Your comment sort of gave the idea of history being a finely-refined monolithic set of true statements , but of course historians do disagree on what actually happened to a degree . On a lot of things , e . g . the the great depression , they disagree more than the general public , who are like "" capitalism failed , FDR saved lol "" . Right there , you have an example of people who disagree with the mainstream narrative actually being more likely to know anything at all about the topic , and actually having looked at the evidence . But , don't all historians agree the holocaust is real ? First off , most historians focus on different parts of history so their opinion isn't worth more than that of any random person , but yes , there have been actual historians who publicly disputed parts , or the entirety , of the holocaust narrative . Those people lost their jobs and got blacklisted , some were threatened with violence and had to change their identity , some even got arrested , tried and imprisoned for it . Now , do you think that might affect the inclinations of the rest of historians to publicly question the established holocaust narrative ? Not saying they are liars , it's enough for them to avoid looking into the topic or to keep their views to themselves . part <NUMBER> : extra Nazi's themselves admit to it [ ... ] Is the Holocaust a nazi conspiracy to paint themselves as evil ? It is fine for you to believe this , given how often such claims are put forward by the professional holocaust-pushers . While anyone can say "" I'm a Nazi and holocaust was real "" , did actual Nazis admit to it ? The only person charged at Nuremberg with personally killing Jews , Ernst Kaltenbrunner , testified that he received no such orders and first heard about holocaust from foreign media . The concentration camp guards who corroborated the holocaust narrative left the Soviet interrogation rooms with their testicles destroyed . I think you'll agree those testimonies are worthless . There are no government records , or records by Third Reich officials that mention systematic mass-murder of Jews , only the removal of Jews from the Third Reich and from Europe , which was not a secret but the publicly stated policy . The confession of the "" Nazi "" arch-witness at Nuremberg , Rudolf Hoess , was acquired after <NUMBER> days of him being beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep , exposed to the elements and force-fed with alcohol . ( source : Death Dealer , Legions of Death ) Due to his state at the time , he did not remember the confession afterwards . The confession conflicts with physical evidence , e . g . he confessed to murdering <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> million people , while today the official holocaust figure for Auschwitz is <NUMBER> million . Such testimony is not admissible in a real court , but it was nevertheless used to justify his subsequent execution . part <NUMBER> : After the war , Churchill , Eisenhower and DeGaule all wrote memoirs detailing the war period . None of them mentions gas chambers or any mass extermination scheme . ...

Ultimately , scheme are Jews . You have the Rothschilds , the Warburgs , and the Morgans as prominent Jews .

You have such Jewish controlled banks and corporations such as the Federal Reserve Bank , Goldman-Sachs , and Monsanto corrupting governments and exploiting and harming most of the people of the world . It is odd when you consider that even the common Miriam and Moshe are harmed by their policies .

They can think nothing of their Jewishness and embrace all people . Unfortunately , as a group they have a long history of being opposed to and a danger to my people by mostly supporting every liberal policy and degenerate thing .

All of it stemming from insecurity and a lack of coping skills they should have learned in elementary school . Sure , there are bullies and there are victims . There will always be the predator and the prey , the strong and the weak , but it is a choice to be either one . You can't control whether or not someone will choose to bully , attack , assault , or rape you , but you do make the choice to be a victim and furthermore , to remain a victim . These idiots never learned that . In school , they were taught that there is no such thing as failure . They never had to feel the backlash of what it means to watch someone else be the winner . No , they got the trophy , too . Didn't matter how poorly you performed , you were still deserving of recognition . And that was what they learned ; that they deserved recognition simply because of who they were . That because they were special , their shortcomings should not be a factor preventing the world from propping them up . Which isn't so bad if it happened once or twice to a child . Sometimes life just sucks and you need a win just to feel a little bit better , no matter how hollow that win might be . But these parasites grew up with the belief implanted that their insecurities , their personal failings , their appearance , all the things that society shunned were in fact things society was obligated to embrace . And from this belief blossomed the desperation we see now . The desperation of lonely , the fat , the "" oppressed "" , the peculiar , the weird , the fringe . All of them seeking their place at the dinner table of life to be served their portion of what they believe they are entitled to , and not because they earned it , but because they see everyone getting it , so why can't they ? Slowly , over time , this cancerous notion of entitlement and victimhood gets dressed up as diversity and inclusivity when in reality , it's merely meant to give these these social reject a chance for a brief moment of mental orgasmic ecstasy when their peers enshrine them as paragons of social progress . Oddly enough , their message is actually on point once you strip away the insanity that surrounds it ; everyone should be able to find love and happiness .

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

15422	uncensorednews	"Do you have a source ? Nope , just a good intuition for how race hoaxes usually plays out . In this case there's the propaganda-ish name , the fact that blacks generally are bad soldiers ( probably good warriors , but lack discipline and foresight ) and that this wasn't more widely known before since liberal media is so very , very desperate for succesful black rolemodels in any area of life . Even if you think blacks are equally predisposed to become good soldiers as whites there's still the fact that the one black regiment became an elite regiment , despite having a far smaller recruiting pool than whites . And blacks having no soldierly culture prior to this . I haven't ever read anything but glowing things about them . Yeah , that's kind of a clue that something's not right . Units that see a lot of combat inevitably will get some bloody noses . The nickname "" Hell Fighters "" was given to them by the Germans due to their toughness and that they never lost a man through capture , lost a trench or a foot of ground to the enemy There're are two weird things in this passage . One , the enemy is supposed to have praised them for their toughness . Firstly , that's a weird thing to do , though not unheard of , Ernst Junger praised the Scots for being insane psycho trench fighters . Though Ernst Junger considered getting shelled good therapeutic fun and trench raiding to be a nice afternoon adventure , so not typical . Secondly , supposing that was true , how the hell would anyone know until long after the fact ? For that matter , why's the nickname in English ? Most suspiciously is never losing a trench or even a foot of ground . That means you're either extremely good or have been in very few to zero serious fights over territory .

15639	gaming	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

15654	politics	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

Right now , it's indisputable that there is a global Islamic terrorism issue . You cannot dispute that .

No one's acting like all Muslims are our enemy . We all know this isn't true . What we're acting like is that if we have X number of people we let into this country per year , the less of them that are Muslim or free radicalized countries the better . It's not like we're closing off all refugees . For every potential radical Muslim we bar entry to , there's another refugee from somewhere else we let in .

16056	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

16075	fatpeoplehate	I agree , it's basically the effect of cognitive dissonance + weakness / immaturity . The cognitive dissonance is getting worse thanks to HAES and FA , and then since they're too weak to own up to what they did to their own body the easiest way for them to get over the cognitive dissonance is to blame anything they can cling on to ( genetics , the patriarchy , blah blah ) . The key for them is to not be responsible for their fatness , whether through bullshit HAES , trying to change the definition of beauty , or just flat out denying reality ( I saw a post about a fat saying calories don't exist . All of my what . ) I think there are quite a few former fats here who were uninformed when they were younger / living with parents but , when slapped by reality as they got older , were strong enough emotionally / maturity wise to own up to their bad diet . Rather than extremists , i think they're all just mentally children who deny the truth , throw tantrums and act based on their fee-fees , and refuse to take responsibility for their crap . They can't bring themselves to own up to what they did to their own bodies . If you look for it in posts , it's everywhere ( bankruptcy ham , hams crying about how it's not fair that they're fat / men don't like them / their doctor is telling them things that make their fee-fees hurt , etc ) And then society coddles them and the delusion gets worse ...

16087	fatpeoplehate	Just to clarify , libertarians are not objectivists . Or rather not all of them are . The two belief systems are largely compatible and objectivists follow the same principles as libertarians but being a libertarian does not inherently mean you are an objectivist . Libertarians do care about social issues , though we often disagree with the major political parties on how to solve them . Libertarians are pro-equality across the board . You have to be . You can't follow the major principles of libertarianism and be , say , anti-gay marriage ( well , I guess you could be but you'd be a major hypocrite and would have some major cognitive dissonance going on ) . There is also a lot of disagreement within libertarianism ( at least as a political movement , I'm not sure how much that extends to libertarianism as pure philosophy ) as to the specifics of a lot of policy . For example taxes are a hotly debated topic within libertarianism . Some are completely against any taxation at all while others argue that , though it may violate the non-aggression principle , some amount of taxation is necessary as a practicality of having a functioning government .

16136	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

16200	sjwhate	Fundamental biological difference between men and women is not the reason they are treated differently ? One of them has to grow and carry babies , entire human beings , inside her for nine months while being physically hindered and vulnerable . That's a difference large enough to warrant a different role in society . Case in point , the more women try to be like men , the less children they have or the less chance they have of having children at all . While that's not wrong per se , it's wrong for a society , because of a society doesn't have kids because of culture , ideology or circumstances , that society is per definition an utter failure , because it will die out and be replaced by another . It really takes an overeducated ideologically infuriated SJW to deny huge measurable physical differences .

There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn . To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" . To put it more simply : everything is a Skinner box in this sense , as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning . The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule . And again , practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered . tl ;d r : Yes , games are like Skinner boxes .

Yoko visited Paul and asked him to talk to John about coming back when her own personal relationship on the side was over . Yoko obsessively called John almost on a daily basis , according to both John and May Pang during their separation . So John didn't come crawling back by any means .

17239	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

I've read the entire Quran and have listened to lectures and explanations over the course of my life and I've found nothing that couldn't be explained to make sense or that was disgusting or something . Of course there's some outdated stuff in there that can't apply sometimes anymore but that's just how religion works . The entirety of the religion can <NUMBER> % of the time still apply to everything in this day and age . Most of the anti-Islam hate I see is online anyways . I kind of consider it propaganda now . I've seen people that once protested around a mosque to tell Muslims to go back to their country become Muslims at my local mosque after they actually talked to an Imam or read the Quran and understood it . Picking some bad verses about killing isn't going to work when it comes to understanding Islam . You need context and the full meaning behind every verse before you start to go out and give your piece of mind on what you think about Islam . I hope this answers your question .

17343	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

Hitler , however , went ahead with his plan ignoring their concerns and regained the territory without a shot being fired . Surprisingly , the French and the British , whose combined strenh could have stopped Hitler in his tracks , did nothing more than voice their disapproval of Germany ’ s actions , which meant in effect they looked the other way .

17406	politics	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : <URL> Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

17526	leagueoflegends	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around <NUMBER> to cast <NUMBER> to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an <NUMBER> mana , <NUMBER> turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip with + <NUMBER> / + <NUMBER> , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : <NUMBER> multicolored mana and <NUMBER> turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost <NUMBER> black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only . Sight Ward : Wouldn ’ t even be good if it cost <NUMBER> . Maybe cantrip it when it dies ? Vision Ward : Even worse than sight ward . Cantrip ’ ing it would still make it worse than a cantrip ’ d sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward . Warwick : Suffers from the exact same problems as corki , too complicated for an uncommon , will never find a place in constructed , but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity .	NOT

17721	uncensorednews	Syncopation is a single concept in music , and not anything relevant . You rarely see any of the concepts or musical iterations used in jazz in any classical pieces . Notation is also irrelevant in the regard of music . It's great and widely used , but being able to write music down is not a measure of greatness . Sure there are some imports , but Jazz by nature is a mix of every idea and concept in music there is and therefore superior to all other forms . It takes the best of everything , blues , world , soul , classical and others . There are great classical composers . The Newton of music may have been a classical composer , but the Einstein is a jazz musician . If classical was truly the best form of music , you wouldn't see every other genre in the world having more prolific artists than it in the present moment . The best musicians right now are Jazz artists , and the reason is that it is the most creative and deep genre in existence . It isn't even derived from Classical music as you supposed earlier . You clearly haven't studied music to any notable degree whatsoever , and all you're arguing is based off your uncultured taste . edit : I studied classical piano for <NUMBER> years , and jazz guitar for <NUMBER> , from the ages of <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> .

17900	OperationPullRyan	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section <NUMBER> ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section <NUMBER> renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year <NUMBER> to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section <NUMBER> modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section <NUMBER> , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section <NUMBER> requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section <NUMBER> before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section <NUMBER> could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section <NUMBER> requires the President to submit a report to the Congress <NUMBER> days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section <NUMBER> further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section <NUMBER> , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

17992	politics	Political suicide in the name of one's beliefs would not only set a solid example and precedent , but it would inspire his base . I understand the politics , and I get he feels like he had to pass it , but his previous statements about indefinite detention do very little to make me think he really regrets this . He still loses my vote .	NOT
17993	uncensorednews	I'll tell you why . The bible is a collection of stories about god and that's how Christians perceive it , so there's a lot of room for cherry picking and fitting it somehow into western society . The Quran is thought to be THE word of god and that's how Muslims perceive it . It's difficult to cherry pick the verses you like and disregard the ones you don't . You either take it all or leave it all . That was the sort of moral dilemma I was trapped into when I was a Muslim . There were a lot of verses in the Quran that I didn't agree with and I tried so hard to interpret them in a way that makes them have a somewhat good meaning that is compatible with modern human values , but being a native speaker of Arabic who understood exactly what the verses meant in a literal sense , I felt that I was being disingenuous and I stopped lying to myself not long after that . I don't think the effort to modernize Islam is going to be very fruitful , not until Muslims admit that the Quran is not actually perfect in anyway and couldn't have been written by god ( assuming that he exists ) , which is not easy .
