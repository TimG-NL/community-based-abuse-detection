125	> how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John NUMBER : NUMBER , NUMBER and Acts NUMBER : NUMBER says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . > So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER , NUMBER says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev NUMBER : NUMBER , NUMBER says death will be done away with , Isiah NUMBER : NUMBER confirms death will be swallowed up . > This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . > so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

377	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from NUMBER up to NUMBER + , your only option is to cast a higher  quantity  of spells rather than improving the  quality  of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

981	"I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement : "" In short , it is illegeal specifically ... "" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : NUMBER.NUMBER Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit   or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered .   While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

END EDIT . He's not your buddy , he isn't on our side , start looking at him as the man with more power than anyone else in the world , and realize if he wants to , which he does since he requested the provisions , he could detain you for life due to whatever he sees fit as a reason . EDIT : I'd also like to mention , although my post is more feeling than thought , I spent a good month following this bill , have actually read it , and as such , know all the fancy revisions just made the wording more muddled . I encourage you to not be alienated by my inflammatory post , and instead , read the offending section of the law for yourself , as well as some analysis from lawyers . Seriously . Regardless of what you think about this issue , regardless of whether you normally research things before you opine on them , this is the time to do it . BIG EDIT : I've never had more posts to reply to than I have the time to , and honestly , I'm impressed , a lot of you know your history . Granted , a lot of you are treating this like a game of football . What matters isn't what is right or wrong , you and I , regardless of where in the world we are , are now in a struggle against worldwide tyranny , or far worse , the full on destruction of our only planet . You need to be aware that there is a lot of uncertainty to all of this . We aren't sure what any of these people are planning , just that their methods to reach their plans have moved away from the common interest of all humans . I do not know what will happen , as I've never witnessed tyranny first hand , all I know is that if we do nothing , we can assume the worst will happen . But , if we act now , and protest , and let those we interact with know how we feel on this issue , and debate , and discuss , and improve our thoughts , as we have been on reddit , we have a chance of turning the tide . The closest way to that solution I see now is what Occupy is , it's what the hippie movement was , it's a movement for human actualization , let's try to not fuck it up this time with the drugs and anti-establishment message , and make this a message all humans want to be a part of . This is more important than all of that . We need a new constitution that reflects our greater understanding of humanity , as the founders gathered to develop years ago .	NOT

1473	I'm not sure of the exact timeline , but I know I was already showing signs of development around NUMBER .

I had strong muscular legs , and I literally had the perfect body for a girl five years older than me . So , when I was in fifth grade , my older cousin Rich was graduating from high school in my district . He was a popular football player from an unusually successful iteration of our school's football team . He had a lot of friends . As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation , there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends . I was NUMBER years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure . But later she told me they had to tell Rich's friend I was only NUMBER . Cue about two or three years of wearing baggy t-shirts and wide legged jeans .	NOT

Even taking a tylenol for a hangover is pretty damn bad and should be avoided at all cost . edit : I also wanted to mention that although the current max recommended limit is NUMBER grams that is still pretty high . High enough that the FDA is considering lowering it to NUMBER.NUMBER grams - NUMBER.NUMBER grams . So , also be aware of that . source for the lowering dose thing - URL	NOT

1789	"Question : "" Why pray ? What is the point of prayer when God knows the future and is already in control of everything . If we cannot change God's mind , why should we pray ? "" Answer : For the Christian , praying is like breathing . It is easier to do it than to not do it . We pray for a variety of reasons . For one thing , prayer is a form of serving God ( Luke NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) and obeying Him . We pray because God commands us to pray ( Philippians NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . Prayer is exemplified for us by Christ and the early church ( Mark NUMBER : NUMBER ; Acts NUMBER : NUMBER ; NUMBER : NUMBER ; NUMBER : NUMBER ; NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ; NUMBER : NUMBER ; NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray , we should also . If He needed to pray to remain in the Father ’ s will , how much more do we need to pray ? Another reason to pray is that God intends prayer to be the means of obtaining His solutions in a number of situations . We pray in preparation for major decisions ( Luke NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ); to overcome demonic barriers ( Matthew NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest ( Luke NUMBER : NUMBER ); to gain strenh to overcome temptation ( Matthew NUMBER : NUMBER ); and to obtain the means of strenhening others spiritually ( Ephesians NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . We come to God with our specific requests , and we have God's promise that our prayers are not in vain , even if we do not receive specifically what we asked for ( Matthew NUMBER : NUMBER ; Romans NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . He has promised that when we ask for things that are in accordance with His will , He will give us what we ask for ( NUMBER John NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . Sometimes He delays His answers according to His wisdom and for our benefit . In these situations , we are to be diligent and persistent in prayer ( Matthew NUMBER : NUMBER ; Luke NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . Prayer should not be seen as our means of getting God to do our will on earth , but rather as a means of getting God's will done on earth . God ’ s wisdom far exceeds our own . For situations in which we do not know God's will specifically , prayer is a means of discerning His will . If the Syrian woman with the demon-influenced daughter had not prayed to Christ , her daughter would not have been made whole ( Mark NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ , he would have remained blind ( Luke NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . God has said that we often go without because we do not ask ( James NUMBER : NUMBER ) . In one sense , prayer is like sharing the gospel with people . We do not know who will respond to the message of the gospel until we share it . In the same way , we will never see the results of answered prayer unless we pray . A lack of prayer demonstrates a lack of faith and a lack of trust in God ’ s Word . We pray to demonstrate our faith in God , that He will do as He has promised in His Word and bless our lives abundantly more than we could ask or hope for ( Ephesians NUMBER : NUMBER ) . Prayer is our primary means of seeing God work in others ' lives . Because it is our means of “ plugging into ” God's power , it is our means of defeating Satan and his army that we are powerless to overcome by ourselves . Therefore , may God find us often before His throne , for we have a high priest in heaven who can identify with all that we go through ( Hebrews NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . We have His promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much ( James NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER ) . May God glorify His name in our lives as we believe in Him enough to come to Him often in prayer .

3334	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power .

Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

3348	I remember always liking Jimi Hendrix , and alwasy hearing he was the best , a super psychadelic monster that was invincible , and I believed it to some degree , but I guess I had just never totally understood the utter reverence that so many people had for him . One day , I met up with some friends at the beach who were all tripping , and one of them casually asks if I want to as well . It was a beautiful sunny day on the San Juans in Washinon , on a rocky coast with seals dipping in and out , and starfish everywhere . I decided to do it . Well , after spending some time with them , the sun started to go down , and they all began to head on , but I realized my trip was just beginning . I made my way home alone , decided to play some music as the trip took hold and thus began my moment with Jimi . I made my way slowly into my friend's room , which was still somewhat dark . I could hear things crawling and creaking on my peripherals , my vision swam with color and things gently breathed all around me . I sat down the couch and saw my roomie's guitar hooked up to the amp . I grabbed it , and in so doing touched his computer which had been left on . Immediately , a Jimi Hendrix playlist that he had been jamming along with began to play , the guitar already set in tune , with perfect crunch . I looked up , and lo and behold the moonlight had begun streaming through a window covered by a cloth wall hanging of Jimi hendrix himself . His lines , his rhythms , his playing suddenly all made totaly sense to me . He weaves this incredible psychadelic pattern that is amazing colorful and delicate . You can hear two or even three gutair parts weaving in and out of his playing effortlessly while he plays . It drives itself directly to your core , and explodes with joy and light . I don't know how long I was there playing with Jimi , but I'll never forget it , it really opened my eyes to what Psychadelic music really was , and the power music can have over a person who has a gift like that . Luckily , there are MANY wonderful musicians with that gift .	NOT

3406	"My sister . Lived with her for four years in college in an off-campus apartment . Her room , and by room I mean the place where she slept , was nothing more than a floor hamper . There was only one place in the entire room where you could view the "" carpet "" , a three by two foot section in front of a floor mirror where she would sit and apply makeup every day . Needless to say , I put "" carpet "" in quotations earlier because what you could view here was technically carpeting , but no longer the mauve color like in MY room , but a mottled splattering of reds , pinks , browns , tans , and blacks . The rest of the floor was covered in dunes of dirty clothes that measured between half a foot to two feet thick in places . It was like walking on a water bed when I would have to trek through her room to collect all the dirty dishes when I had nothing to eat on . Our cat , angry at life and at her , would periodically pee on her clothes . and cover them ( like a litterbox ) . One would think that this would entice her to clean ... but no ... she would just live in the stink and I was eventually forced to retreat entirely to my bedroom in the back and keep the door closed with the window open . When she moved out , I had huge plans for her spare room . I was going to put in some workout equipment , make it a nice man cave . So I rented a carpet cleaner . thirty minutes , one broken steam cleaner , and a 3ft by NUMBER ft patch of clean carpet later , I was overpowered by the smell . I closed the door , stuffed towels in the gap and walked away . When I moved out five months later I went to the office and turned in my key . THey asked me for a forwarding address so they could send me my security deposit ... I just laughed and told them not to worry about it ."	NOT

NOT
3459	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

3467	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

4079	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following :  The training and certification that teachers go through .  Thereby , the recommended teaching methods .  The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability .  A broad control over what  gets  taught , in the form of a curriculum .  A teacher's  conduct  , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would  you  like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in  general  are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

4153	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take  any  short sequence from  any  film , and make a mash-up just like this using NUMBER different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last NUMBER years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in NUMBER.NUMBER : NUMBER , not what looks like something closer to  NUMBER.NUMBER : NUMBER ( which was more common in early movies ) . Meaning , even the footage from Raiders has been altered to more closely resemble the footage on the right .	NOT

Alan Kertz will kill any run & gun play there is on close quarters with these changes and everybody will have to use low horizontal recoil weapons if they want to do so like m416 , m16 , m4 with either a suppressor or laser without foregrip . Suggested changes will basically make everyone start using the same weapons without foregrips or bipod then he'll come back here and bitch about everyone using the same NUMBER-NUMBER weapons as Assault and Engineer and not attaching a bipod or foregrip . He'll probably keep continuing by nerfing those since they'll all be overused by then . Making foregrip reduce horizontal recoil by NUMBER.NUMBER deg on all weapons gotta be the worst idea this guy ever suggested . My bet is that it'll be in the next patch since he's basically screwing the game over and over again every patch .	NOT

6430	So you're Israeli then ? It takes quite a warped sense of right and wrong to try and justify all this . You act like the US should be greatful they have a country like Israel they're forced to give expensive military equipment to for free , which Israel then sells to the Chinese and continues to build illegal settlements despite promising the US not to . > you pay them huge money for oil they pump out of their ground for free Are you delusional ? Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money . Man the Israel propaganda machine has done a real number on you . > But yeah israel is all mean to people that are shooting rockets at their cities day in day out and who send suicidebombers to blow up their kids , how uncivilized to not simply be happy about that right ? And they killed jesus right ? but you are just being reasonable right ? right ... We're not talking about any of that , we're talking about how the US is Israels bitch :) Besides , Israels terrorist activities , numerous crimes against humanity , and general constant dickishness does not go away because of what someone else did . I'll let you have the last word , I'm not going to reply anymore to someone so stupid who thinks that pumping oil out of the ground is free or that Saudi Arabia paying for US aircraft is the same thing as the US giving Israel aircraft for free . If you ever run a business where you sell stuff please do let me know , I'll visit you and ask you give me money so that I can buy something you're selling , it makes good business sense right ? :D	NOT

6491	"No ... you're confusing the size of the money supply with the ability of the bank to make loans . Fractional reserve banking increases the size of the money supply ( i . e . amount of money in circulation ) but it doesn't let a bank lend out money it doesn't actually have .  When we both deposit 200k in bank NUMBER , bank NUMBER can make a loan of up to $ 200k . Someone comes along and borrows 200k - this person may deposit 50k of that money into bank NUMBER , therefore allowing bank NUMBER to make out of a loan of $ 50k . This $ NUMBER . 4m number ( or whatever it is ) assumes three things , which aren't necessarily true :  All loan proceeds are deposited back into bank accounts - which makes no sense , people take loans to buy things like cars and houses and pay off credit cards . In reality the money filters through the economy and may eventually end up at a bank anywhere in the world  Any loan proceeds deposited into a bank account must be deposited with the same bank that made the original loan - which probably won't happen , given there are thousands of banks in the US , let alone the world . i . e . if bank NUMBER made a loan of 200k , there's no guarantee the 50k deposit would be with bank NUMBER , it's more likely to be elsewhere .  No reserve ratio There is definitely some element of this happening ( i . e . loan proceeds becoming bank deposits at other banks ) , but the Federal Reserve puts brakes on lending by dictating reserve requirements for banks ( i . e . what fraction of deposits must be held at the Fed , the "" fractional "" in fractional reserve ) . Thus , the $ NUMBER . 4m thing never happens - maybe the money supply is inflated to $ 300k or $ 400k depending on reserve requirements , but this is split amongst many banks and potentially countries . Bank NUMBER is not going on a crazy lending spree . In economics this whole concept is called the multiplier effect of money . This lending / deposit / lending cycle has increased the size of the money supply , but it hasn't actually let bank NUMBER make $ NUMBER . 4m in loans .   Yes , a bank can monetize future loan cashflows & package this as a securitized bond , and then use the proceeds of this securitized bond to make more loans - that happens all the time with mortgages - but really now , that's far beyond this topic "	NOT

6597	"I don't know if the "" verge of collapse "" is correct . I see a serious decline in living standards . How far this will go is beyond me to be honest , but it feels like a collapse in all we are accustomed to already . I see our country falling into a quasi police state . I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since NUMBER has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in NUMBER I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then . I didn't like the Patriot Act , but the sunset clause made it ok . I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant . I also understood why President Bush sought to go to Iraq versus waiting for more to come here . He was providing targets for potential terrorist in their sand box so our children could be safe . I didn't like it , but it was a solution I could accept . I moved as far away from the city as possible to avoid anymore planes falling out of the sky and tried to forget about the national nightmare that could have killed most of my family . ( My step dad was supposed to be on guard at the Pentagon , My grandmother and grandfather lived in Somerset with my sister at the time . ) Then I learned about peak oil . I thought , so what we have at least NUMBER years left . I explained away any concerns that nagged at me , until suddenly one day ... I think NUMBER or so I thought about all of it . I realized this was not the world I grew up in , and due to things beyond my control may never be . I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience . I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain . Then I stopped thinking about the past . I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own . I changed the way I lived . I lowered expenses . I learned to cook and bake . Then I learned to grow a few foods . I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the NUMBER dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden . When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food , he changed the old bathroom into a pantry . This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store NUMBER months of food for our family . We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country . If not , my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways . We could have kept on doing what we always have . I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad . I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received . I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than NUMBER washings . I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline . I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat . If you can ignore all of this , then God Bless you . I can't . For me , the collapse of our living standards has already started ."	NOT

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off NUMBER % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

7701	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

8265	"Yes "" free ride "" to the event assuming they qualified for the live tournament . Still forced them to wake up at like 4AM - 6AM to play their matches and at times wait around for players who never show up which affects their sleep schedule and in-turn their play in other leagues such as the GSL ( JulyZerg I think it was woke up  4am once only to wait around till 9am to find out his opponent wasn't going to show ) which is complete BS . Really wasn't worth it to them to sacrifice so much for such a small chance to "" win it all "" no matter what the NASL wanted to do in terms of flight and hotel compensation . It's just a poor format for foreign players not to mention the lenh of one season is twice that of GSL Code-S . I understand its the "" NORTH AMERICAN Star League "" but still , it gives too much of an advantage to NA players to force their opponents to wake up at ridiculous times just to get their games in along with having to play on NA which hinders them even more by having 200ms + ping when they can focus on other tournaments such as the GSL which is way more prestigious . So lets be realistic for a minute : Koreans would be forced to play at ridiculous times , be forced to play on NA ( even if their opponent agrees to play on KOR / EU ) which gives them insane lag , Fly out to a NUMBER-NUMBER day tournament as late as the NASL decides ( meaning if they gotta be there Friday the NASL can just book a flight for thursday or whatever ) so they come in extremely jet lagged and tired and all of this for a tournament that runs TWO months ( NUMBER-NUMBER weeks ) and has the same prize pool as the GSL ... Oh , and did I mention it's also single elimination so ontop of being jet lagged , tired and the schedule taking it's toll on you for the last NUMBER-NUMBER weeks you also cannot afford to drop a series otherwise you've completely wasted your time . Really , the NASL is a JOKE and the only reason they offered what they offered to korean players is because they know their viewership and competition level would be on the decline without them .

One of his favorite books is Isaac Asimov's  The Foundation Trilogy  and he warns about the dangers of EMP weapons . I mean , come on . He's crazy and fun . Edit : I should say Jon Huntsman is arguably the best candidate , and from a strictly utilitarian view , I'd support him over the other Republicans . But given that he's going nowhere , I'm going to pull for Gingrich in the primaries for my own perverted and weird reasons .	NOT

Not everyone believes the bible literally . I do . I don't see any other way .

Many can , I cannot - it would be illogical .

9662	Why so salty ?	NOT
9663	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are NUMBER % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

9761	I had actually forgotten about that . I do know a little about this stuff , emphasis on the ' little ' . Without doing any googling , what I remember about the mini-shuttle is that is was a testbed for the SR-NUMBER follow-on , sometimes known as the ' Aurora ' , and not intended as a production craft . I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR-NUMBER getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

The situation was cause for thought for me and I thought it was cause for thought for others allowing an interesting discussion to open up . I'm unsure about your advice to : > Instead of telling your friends to completely stop , you could have just as easily used what your friends were doing to give value to the entire restaurant . You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people .

I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance , but in any case , it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person , in fact , part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values .

Learn about programming - as I said , I'm just starting to teach myself Python and I'd like to apply what I learn . I'm open to switching to PHP for my web project , or learning both in parallel . NUMBER . Get a money-making website off the ground reasonably quickly - This is going to start off as a personal finance site that's mainly just blog-like content . At the beginning , Wordpress , Joomla , Drupal , or even just static HTML would probably be fine to get it off the ground . NUMBER . Integrate more advanced features into the site down the road - As I learn more about programming and WebDev I would like to add more functionality to the site , for example XML product and coupon feeds , dynamic content generation based on site-search queries , possibly a tracking / rewards system for users who use the site frequently , etc ... I'm guessing this is where my choice of platform will have the most impact ? How hard is Drupal to learn vs . Wordpress ? Will it allow me to grow the site bigger in the long run ?

10924	I have no evidence to support that hypothesis , so at this point I must conclude that no , I am not . To support my previous statement however , we are able to measure gravity with tremendous precision , and it varies depending on where you stand on Earth due to your physical proximity to core . Similarly , gravity is weaker on the moon than it is on Earth , and the moon's gravity also affects Earth's rotation . Meanwhile , there is also the other planets of the solar system and of course the Sun itself , not to mention the contents of the milky way galaxy . Even a planetoid's gravity is not constant , as it accrues or loses mass its gravity consequently alters . Therefore , I conclude that gravity itself is subjective and not immutable . Even that however does not demonstrate objective morality , as was the initial request .	NOT

"" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that   we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it  easier  to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' .   That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am  not  saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM   !

Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra NUMBER is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every NUMBER + NUMBER as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it . So I failed Algebra NUMBER while passing the state algebra test and getting 99th percentile in those stupid state tests . Now I'm in college taking Calculus NUMBER , and still not showing work for algebra problems . Sure I'll show some work if the problem gets crazy , but you'll never see me showing work for a simple solve for x or crap . kp1197 has it , if it's easy nobody writes it out .

11870	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : URL Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

11942	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

The world itself is one that I've run another campaign in about a year ago , except the current campaign is NUMBER years in the future after she's taken over and rules most of the world with undead . Suffice to say the party from the first campaign failed to stop her , lol . Unfortunately , two of the NUMBER players from that group ( not my Sunday group ) moved away and the game had to end . I was a little relieved because running NUMBER games simultaneously while playing in a 3rd is a wee bit taxing . I only got the thorn dice about a month ago and now I make sure to use them to maximum dramatic effect .

I knew he had it in him to treat me well - - I just knew it  I got into a pattern of thinking , if only I can just be good enough and do things right enough , he'll start treating me well again . The truth is that with a real partner ,  you do not have to earn basic kindness and respect  . This is key . You BOTH get those things , right off the bat and for the duration of the relationship . Anyone who cannot manage basic , kindergarten-level kindness is not being a real partner to you , and you leave . I had trouble with the same thing you did : if he treated me so well right at the beginning , why couldn't we just go back to that ?  Honestly , I never figured out why he thought it was okay to bait me with kindness and romance and then treat me poorly . But with time , I realized that his behavior would never make sense to me , because I want the people I date to feel good . Basically , I figured out that I'll never understand why he was a huge asshole  because I'm not a huge asshole  . Don't be scared . You'll feel better ; you'll be more confident about how your partners are supposed to treat you in the future .

This means his social policy changes would require the endorsement of Congress - not likely to happen with a cohesive Progressive Caucus . However as Commander in Chief , he could immediately withdraw troops from Afghanistan and other conflict areas ( overt and covert ) , he could immediately declare an end to the "" War on Terror "" , etc . (  there is one potential downside to his doing this , but I'll footnote it below  . ² ) All in all , I don't think he'd be as dangerous as we Progressives tend to view him ( and yes , I still think his social positions are largely dangerous ) . Moreover , if we allow Obama to continue on his path we only assure ourselves of a now known quantity . Obama has been a very slick politician and has done SOME progressive things , but overall he's very easily more of a centrist than a progressive . He has surrounded himself with his Goldman Sachs buddies , has signed the extension of the PATRIOT Act , has reversed his campaign promise to shut down GITMO , has authorized assassination of US citizens without trial ( or even accusation ) , and today signed NDAA . I still see Ron Paul as generally a nut on economic and social issues , but when laid out the way Greenwald has masterfully done here , I can honestly say there's actually a greater chance of my voting for Ron Paul now than Obama . Half an hour ago you couldn't have convinced me of this . Now (   for now   ) I am virtually certain of it . MIND = BLOWN ___ ¹ I will be messaging this person to concede my newfound "" support "" for Ron Paul . ² My big concern with   someone like Ron Paul   bringing home the troops en masse , is that where a progressive president would try to put them to work on infrastructure projects , ensure they have adequate support from the social safety net , and otherwise "" take care "" of them , I see Ron Paul potentially just letting them fend for themselves in keeping with his Libertarian views . That scares me ... a lot ."	NOT

13913	[ This NYT article ] ( URL helped me a lot :   Michele Bachmann   is the obvious choice for a true Tea Party believer , who wants a candidate to carry the banner of far right contempt for and alienation from Washinon . Other candidates try on the Tea Party tri-corn , but it doesn ’ t fit . Ms . Bachmann is the real deal – and for that reason , I think she has no chance of winning .   Rick Santorum   is the candidate for a Republican who places a high premium on strongly conservative social positions sincerely held . Mr . Santorum doesn ’ t just talk about these issues , he ’ s voted on them repeatedly . He is inflexibly opposed to a woman ’ s right to make decisions about her reproductive life . He is clearly religious but doesn ’ t exploit it like like Gov . Rick Perry , who wears his Christianity on his sleeve and across his shirts , like a Nike swoosh . And if you really care about abortion , as in banning it , Mr . Santorum is your guy .   Rick Perry   is an alternative for voters who are driven by their Christian faith , and don ’ t mind that he ’ s going to embarrass them by using their common religion in a comic-opera way . People who miss George W . Bush and want to make that mistake all over again could do a lot worse than Mr . Perry . That also goes for death penalty advocates . Mr . Perry is not reliably rightwing on immigration , but I can ’ t imagine that he would actually pursue his beliefs on the subject if he got into office . Kind of like Mr . Bush .   Jon Huntsman   is the obvious choice for more moderate Republicans who like a candidate who can articulate his positions , has experience in international affairs ( remember when Republicans actually cared about that ? ) , has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big .   Ron Paul   is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day NUMBER : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day NUMBER ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ?   Newt Gingrich   is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich .   Mitt Romney   . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

The same , in my eye , is going for protesters today . Actions are being made and when consequences happen they get angry . This is because they are not used to consequences , they have been shadowed and shunned because getting away with things gives more of a high . Same can be said for Steam today . People are getting banned for trying to abuse the achievements and getting free games on separate accounts . This is against their rules and their main accounts are being banned without refunds . Broke the rules , got caught and expect the consequences to disappear . Rules are in place because Society at one point willed them and demanded them . They remain in effect until broken , however breaking them will have consequences . Bastardizing those who enforce the consequences isn't really appropriate since it is just a rebound of action .

14157	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight . The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities . Most players don't recognize when the game is tipped in their favor ( IE someone on the enemy team got caught and died ) and fail to make moves on towers and neutral monsters when the enemy team either cannot respond or would be at significant disadvantage in doing so . Bad players , when in the NUMBER-NUMBER advantage , will opt to continue farming , wander aimlessly looking for farm , or B + shop at substantial health . Here's some example logic in which a team has NUMBER-NUMBER advantage and should opt to take dragon / baron or push towers , in that order .  DISCLAIMER :  This is very general . The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron . The exceptions to this line of logic occur most often when your team has been feeding and enemies cannot be dealt with even 5v4 . - - - GUIDE - - - Hau NUMBER Taek Neutral Dagrons after 10mins ( or 20mins for Baron Dagron ) - - -    - IF -   The number of people dead on their team > number of people dead on your team   - THEN -   group & move immediately to a dagron .    - IF -   enemy doesn't respond by also immediately moving to a dagron   - THEN -   begin fighting dagron .    - IF -   enemy moves in during your dagron killings - AND - team is still in good health   - THEN -   engage enemy for an easy teamfight win and extended time in the advantage .   - OTHERWISE -   back out and let them try to take it .

14369	"I can't help going in depth too much : Generally at that point you'll be ready for the Corruption . Hopefully you have gotten a grappling hook by this point , as the chasms in the corruption will just be plain annoying without one . The key ingredient is the hook , which is a frustratingly rare drop ( like NUMBER % ) from Skeletons and Piranhas . The boss in the Corruption is called Eater of Worlds and is summoned by destroying NUMBER Shadow Orbs , which are floating balls that spawn at the bottom of the Corruption ( they're super obvious when you see them ) . They can be broken with a hammer . The only snag is that they tend to be in their own mini caves and the Corruption is made of Ebonstone blocks , which you can only mine with a Nightmare pickaxe or better , which you can only craft once you've killed the Eater of Worlds ! ( He drops shadow scales , which are necessary to make almost all Demonite equipment ) . Luckily , Bombs and Dynamite still blow up Ebonstone , and you've probably found a bunch of those from pots and chests already . Alternatively you can craft a summoning item for him like the Suspicious Eye , but you'll probably want to get items from the Shadow Orbs anyway . When you break Shadow Orbs an item will fall out - either a Musket , a Ball O ' Hurt , a Vilethorn , a Starpower Band , or an Orb of Light . Vilethorn is a spell which I find to make this boss laughably easy . However , you'll need mana to use it . For that you'll need to craft NUMBER Fallen Stars into a Mana Crystal , which gives you NUMBER max mana just like the Crystal Hearts you can find underground give you NUMBER max health . So , fighting the Corruption boss . I think you have to fight him at night but I honestly didn't ever check time of day and didn't have an issue . You'll be so far underground when you summon him that you can't do much in the way of an arena , but there should be a long horizontal corridor right above the shadow orbs . The boss is just a huge version of those annoying burrowing worms , so you want to try to get in the air a bit to see him coming . Build a platform or find a naturally occurring one , it's not a big deal . Like I said , I find the Vilethorn to just destroy this guy . It basically makes a slow moving thorn that does a piddly NUMBER damage , but each piece of the thorn lingers for a few seconds . Each section of the boss has independent health , so if you shoot your vilethorn straight into his head as he comes at you ( or just at a good angle so it goes pretty straight down his body ) it will hit like NUMBER-NUMBER sections of him depending on his speed . This will wreck him quickly . The only issue is mana usage , and you'll run out until you start killing sections , but once you've done enough damage to kill sections they will drop items that restore NUMBER mana and you'll basically continually refill mana as you destroy him . If you do run out of mana you can just run up and smack him with a sword . Keep health potions to chug if you get hurt , but avoiding him isn't that hard . You should get enough shadow scales and demonite from him to make full Shadow Armor , which is a big upgrade in defense from Gold armor , and to make a Nightmare Pickaxe . If you don't , just blow up NUMBER more shadow orbs and fight him again . Also , killing shadow orbs has a chance to cause meteorites to fall . You can mine them with your Nightmare pickaxe to make Meteor Armor ( which is low defense but has special attributes ) and the awesome Meteor Hamaxe , which fuses your Hammer and Axe into one item and is way more powerful than the Demonite equivalents . Okay , after that the Dungeon will probably be your next trek . I think you could do the Jungle at this point too , but the Dungeon gives you way more shit way more quickly . To get in you have to fight Skeletor . Technically you can go in without killing him , but try it and see what happens ;) . To fight him , you talk to the Old Man NPC out front of the dungeon entrance at night . This takes way less prep and ballyhoo than the last boss . Try to make a long , straight platform to fight him on . Generally I just level off the top of the dungeon and extend it with wooden platforms . If you have Shadow Armor your NUMBER % movement bonus will allow you to stay away easily . The boss is a giant skull with two detached hands . He will float around swinging his hands at you most of the time , and will sometimes "" roar "" and then his head spins and flies at you . During this time his defense goes way down , I think , and he's super easy to hit . If you've been fortunate enough to have a Goblin Invasion already you'll probably have a Harpoon , which is ridiculous for this guy . The Harpoon is a unique weapon because it autofires when you hold down the mouse button and it will fire the instant the harpoon returns to the gun ( you'll know what I mean when you get one ) . This means you can stand next to something and hold down the attack button to attack it  NUMBER times a second . You can just run in front of Skeletor while he's spin-attacking you and rack up absurd damage . If you don't have a harpoon , the easiest to get weapon is a Demonite bow with Unholy arrows ( which are crafted from normal arrows and the worms ' teeth dropped by Corruption enemies ) or fire arrows . You can also go for guns . If you got a Musket from a shadow orb then an Arms Dealer will move into an open house . He sells the Minishark for NUMBER gold , which is a ton at this point in the game and will make it a pain to get for a new player . If you do get one you can use plain musket balls for ammo or you can craft meteor shot with musket balls and Meteor ore . The Minishark is an automatic gun that will demolish anything pretty quickly but eat through ammo . You can also craft a Space Gun with a flintlock pistol ( sold by the arms dealer ) , meteorite ore and fallen stars . It's a gun that uses mana instead of ammo , but if you get full Meteor Armor it is free to use . That's a shitload of money and / or time , though , for something you can get done with a bow . Once you've destroyed him , you can enter the dungeon . It's got a bunch of chests and a  ton  of enemies , traps , etc . You'll get some really cool stuff in there , though . At that point you can take on the Jungle or Hell . The Jungle offers some unique equipment , like an upgraded grappling hook , but hell offers Molten equipment ."	NOT

That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the NUMBER NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

"" Yo what I never understood is why don't teachers actually give more problems where it's impractical to use the other methods ? If you truly understand the limitations and practical applications of the methods you are teaching , this should be easy . For example , suppose you are teaching the application of calculus to finding minima and maxima . If you ask me to find the minimum of the function x ^ NUMBER - NUMBER  x + NUMBER , obviously I wouldn't bother to use calculus , I would immediately recognize that it factors as ( x-NUMBER ) ^ NUMBER . Instead , you should ask me to find the minimum x ^ NUMBER + 3x ^ NUMBER + NUMBER on the interval [ - NUMBER , NUMBER ] or something . Here's another example : Solve the equation sin ( x ) + cos ( x ) = k . Yes one method is to write cos ( x ) in terms of sin ( x ) and do out the algebra and quadratic formula . But suppose the student is clever and realizes that you may rewrite the left side as sqrt ( NUMBER )  sin ( x + pi / NUMBER ) . Then he just needs to solve sin ( x + pi / NUMBER ) = k / sqrt ( NUMBER ) which is much easier . Basically I disagree with penalizing students for using correct methods that work . If you want them to use a certain method you should give them problems that are more suited to that method ."	NOT

It was Homestead . What my mom calls ' the little Cuba south of Miami ' xD yes , it is hard on relationships and friendships . I am basically a social retard . I have had one best friend my whole life , and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner . Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon . I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people . Either way , i don't have anything keeping me here . Thank the gods for Reddit . Where's your mom from ? While i agree that some things are ... i dunno what the word is ... more abundant here , i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer . And frankly , i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living . Not retail at least . If i had my own farm , okay , i could see it . But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit . I might can fool myself sometimes like today , but it was because i actually did something at work and not because i handled customers . ( re-organized some shit that needed it badly ) I dunno . I am frustrated . I want a simpler life is all , and you can't achieve that here .

16664	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At NUMBER my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was NUMBER at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of NUMBER and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ NUMBER , NUMBER poorer ) I was enrolled in a NUMBER week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at NUMBER , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are NUMBER-NUMBER years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street NUMBER . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for NUMBER years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

16754	"^ Excellent intro to philosophy . Also If you want to go chronologically , For Western Philosophy : look into the pre socratics then Aristotle and Plato Augustine Berkely , Locke , Hume Hobbes Heidegger Kant Hegel Nietsche - - read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus ' The Orestia , Sophocles ' Oedipus Cycle , and Euripides the Bacchae . Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

Where agnostic really falls in is on the nature of God , what God's true will is , what Christ's true teachings were and if they were corrupted in translation , is the organised church good ? All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . > Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but  why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang .

17177	I think this article demonstrates a pretty limited understanding of the X-Men mythos . The whole concept of mutantkind was developed NUMBER ) as an easy and convenient way of creating a whole lot of super-heroes without convoluted origin stories and NUMBER ) as an allegory that can fit pretty much any minority group in America . Yes , the X-Men fight to save a world that “ hates and fears them , ” but if all mutants came pre-equipped with overtly aggressive powers , there ’ s not much of a story in defending the group , is there ? They wouldn ’ t need the protection and influence of the X-Men if being a mutant meant you were a preshrunk asskicking machine . That ’ s the whole point of Charles Xavier , and it drives the occasional moral ambiguity of his mission , and its relation to Magneto ’ s . He , like Magneto , recruits young mutants , takes them under his tutelage , and trains them to weaponize their mutant powers for his own agenda . His agenda is inherently benevolent and peaceful , which separates him from Magneto , but his methods are very similar . Until Planet X that is , which is a vastly UNDERRATED X-Men story . It accomplished two important things . First , it clearly and fundamentally delineated Xavier ’ s morality from Magneto ’ s megalomania . At the end of the day , Magneto is the primary antagonist to the X-Men , and Morrison brought his violent agenda to its logical conclusion . Planet X was always Magneto ’ s end-game , the extermination or subservience of mankind to its mutant successors . It just took getting mixed up with mind-altering drugs and personality-altering bacterial consciousness to drive the morally ambiguous Magneto to this decidedly evil mission . And why is there any problem with Magneto using power-enhancing drugs ? He didn ’ t know what Kick was – no one did . His mutant utopia was butchered , he was paralyzed , and the fate of mutantkind looked more dangerous than ever . It was time for both Magneto and Professor X to rethink and reapply their worldviews in extreme ways ; Professor X went public and launched the X-Corporation as a multinational peacekeeping force , and Magneto planned his most devastating and deadly terrorist attack to date . And he did so by the means available to him , which meant augmenting his powers and infiltrating the X-Men , his most frustrating opponents . How is taking Kick any different than using Fabian Cortez ’ s powers to enhance his powers while destroying his body , as he did under Chris Claremont in the 90s ? Same principle . Second , it established a new dynamic which broke the binary opposition between Xavier and Magneto . Their dueling visions of mutantkind ’ s future dominated the X-Men mythos since its inception ; Morrison showed the inherent flaws in Magneto ’ s violent resistance , as well as Charles Xavier ’ s passive idealism . There ’ s room for additional , morally ambiguous , subjective interpretations of mutantkind that transcend good versus evil or domination versus subservience . Morrison opened the floodgates for new stories and ideas , which were promptly closed by less creative and progressive writers and editors who decided to undo all the significant changes Morrison had brought to the X-Men . Characters like Beak , without clearly developed offensive powers , are representative of this new dynamic . Yes , under the training of Charles Xavier , he was beginning to hone his unfortunate mutation and master the power of flight . ( We saw in Here Comes Tomorrow that continued evolution and training created Beak the super-hero ) . But by his own admission , he refused to be “ anyone ’ s soldier . ” You have to accept a place in the stories for characters like Beak who are simply uninterested in the seemingly endless power struggle between Xavier and Magneto , and who aspire to a different , simpler dream . Likewise , you have to allow for the possibility of revolutionaries like Quentin Quire , whose views clash with Xavier ’ s and are even more extreme than Magneto ’ s . Morrison contributed a lot of terrific stories to the X-Men mythos , ones that embraced every aspect of its legacy , from the crazy space-operas to the evolutionary struggle . In the process , he opened to door to a lot of potential new stories , an opportunity that , in my opinion , has not been taken advantage of . Tl ;d r : Grant Morrison may have provided a lot of unpopular shakeups to the X-Men mythos , but all of these shakeups were pretty logical extensions of existing trends , characters , and dynamics . And , not to be snobby , but anyone who hasn't read The Invisibles isn't going to understand Morrison anyway , and should do so for his own wellbeing .	NOT

18101	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats .

Bill Maher and Penn Jillette are entertainers , so I'm sure more people have heard of them , but they don't really think of atheism first when they think of them . Bill Maher is a comedian . Penn Jillette is an illusionist . People hate and distrust atheists because many times , they feel that their religious background gives them some kind of monopoly on ethics and morality . They think atheists can't care about something bigger than themselves ( which is wrong , we can , it just happens not to be a god ) , and therefore don't have any reason to have moral or ethical concerns .

Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept -  know  that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' .

18793	  Statement by the President on H . R . NUMBER :   Today I have signed into law H . R . NUMBER , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year NUMBER . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over NUMBER pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section NUMBER affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the NUMBER Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law NUMBER-NUMBER ; NUMBER U . S . C . NUMBER note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the NUMBER AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section NUMBER confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section NUMBER ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section NUMBER ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the NUMBER AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section NUMBER in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section NUMBER seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section NUMBER is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section NUMBER provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section NUMBER provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section NUMBER in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past NUMBER years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

Moves are primarily physical based , which to me implies a sense of doing things the old fashioned way - the one who is the strongest makes the rules .    Neutral good - Flying types   . They're paired with almost every other type out there , implying they can get along with just about anyone . Resistant to fighting , so if they don't feel like going along with the rules , they can easily fight back . Several legendaries are flying types , so they can act however they wish too , on their own personal level rather than being bound to follow the rules .    Chaotic good - Dark types   . They play by their rules , not those set by others . Physical attackers , so they don't have to have a plan , just do any move and hope it hits .

They have the ability to do what they want , following their own desires , but can work well within a team . While generally good , their moves can be used for bad .    Lawful evil - Electric types   . Can be harnessed to work and follow the rules , but has the ability to lash out and be extremely harmful depending on the situation .    Neutral evil - Grass types   . Act pretty much in their own interests - while they may not necessarily look for a fight or to harm others , they're not opposed to harming others for their own gain . ( ex : giga drain ) .    Chaotic evil - Fire types   . If the chaotic evil type is one that has no respect for anything , be it rules , lives , or whatever , I think fire fits the bill . It's out to destroy anything , burning up whatever will help fuel it's rage . There is no desire to help , only the goal to keep feeding itself in order to keep burning .	NOT

19330	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are NUMBER % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since NUMBER the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe NUMBER-NUMBER years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

Anything else is a crap shoot - - and by that I'd include VoIP / IM clients ( including enterprise-grade VoIP / IM ) and games ( relevant to IPv NUMBER in the home ) . Server-side software tends to be better about support , in my experience . On the hardware side , routers ( getting better ) , printers ( getting pretty good ! ) , NAS , IP cameras , and of course home entertainment systems ( PVRs , stereo equipment , game consoles ) are very slow on the IPv NUMBER uptake . The situation on both sides improves every year , but IMO the vast majority of networks aren't ready for IPv NUMBER - only unless there's a very limited set of software / hardware involved ."	NOT

19542	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks .

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering URL Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at  you  , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we   are   slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

Balthasar is one of the major theological figures of the 20th century .   Apophaticism    The great grandaddy of the apophatic dimension of Christian theology is unquestionably Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite . You can find his entire collected works in the [  Classics of Western Spirituality  series ] ( URL He's a complicated thinker and mystic , but his  Mystical Theology  is about NUMBER pages . Its the kind of thing that you would read and reread , digesting slowly and prayerfully .  One of the two most influential and important Christian theologians ever , Thomas Aquinas was heavily influenced by Pseudo-Dionysius . Aquinas insisted that our language about God was mostly  analogical  and not simply literal . A good treatment of Aquinas's whole theology is [  Knowing the Love of Christ  ] ( URL Pages NUMBER-NUMBER contain an excellent overview of Aquinas ' mystical-philosophical account of our knowledge of God .  The other most important theologian of the Christian tradition , Augustine , wrote a pretty awesome but pretty thick autobiography called [  The Confessions  ] ( URL One way of looking at  The Confessions  is as Augustine's wrestling with his history of being intimately known by the ultimately unknowable God . A frequent paraphrase of one of Augustine's quotes about God is , "" If you have understood it , it isn't God .

20156	I can tell you that she is a cocky bitch. Your analysis is correct.	EXP
20157	no , not really . Most of the games I play end up being two NUMBER or NUMBER points , and one NUMBER or fewer . However , it's usually very easy to tell who is going to have the NUMBER points . A few things I've gathered over many games : People who get development cards generally win . The more you have , the easier it is . The robber helps the player with development cards win . The player with development cards is also often the player who can get cities easiest . There are NUMBER ( and sometimes NUMBER ) points that often rapidly change hands NUMBER / 3rds of the way through the game ( longest road and largest army ) . It's usually easy to predict this . For example , the longer a development card sits in front of someone , the more likely it is to be road building / monopoly . At least , with my group . Trading becomes much less ... innocent , the more frequently you play with someone . There are NUMBER or NUMBER people I play with who are very , very cagey with their cards at this point . We rarely will trade NUMBER resource for just NUMBER other . It's usually at  least  NUMBER for NUMBER . This is heavily influenced by who has the best position ( not who is  currently  leading ) . Finally , if you aren't first or second to secure a solid position on the board , you are likely out of the running for the game unless you get very , very lucky . - - - > who can make the most devious trades at the end We almost never trade with people who have NUMBER points . It's too easy to give them a win by accident . The only exception is when trading gives you a victory first ( which means they won't trade with you ... ) > find the most creative way to get that last point . There are really only two ways : development cards , or brute force . Brute force is just out spending your opponents ; lots of cities , settlements , and roads ( for longest ) . This is harder when people realize what you're doing and robber you up . Dev cards you've been planning for several rounds , and everyone already is wary of you . You probably have largest army , a road builder card , maybe a monopoly ... It's harder to defend against . I probably play too many boardgames ... this post ended up being longer than I intended . :D	NOT

There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn .

The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule .

20491	From simple.wikipedia.org - Conductors usually beat time with their right hand . This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries ( when they start playing ) or to show them to play louder or softer . Most conductors have a stick called a “ baton ” . It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat . Other conductors prefer not to use a baton . A conductor stands on a small platform called a “ rostrum ” . To be a good conductor is not easy . It is not just a question of giving a steady beat . A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes . They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make . They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants . Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals . They make everything clear through the way they conduct . In short , they are showing the musicians the beat of the song , and telling different sections when it's time for them to get louder or softer , or pointing out whether or not they are too loud or two soft , among many other things .

20544	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : NUMBER . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . NUMBER . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . NUMBER . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself .

20897	"> You do realize that animals eat plants , right ? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten ? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ?  We don't need to be eating plants  We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) > Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . > You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , NUMBER % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed .

They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

20971	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about NUMBER creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding NUMBER Razorverge Thicket and NUMBER more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

21231	> When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent .

If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children .

The authorities granted by the AUMF , including the detention authority , are essential to our ability to protect the American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces , and have enabled us to confront the full range of threats this country faces from those organizations and individuals .   Because the authorities codified in this section already exist , the Administration does not believe codification is necessary   and poses some risk . After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention authority , Congress must be careful not to open a whole new series of NUMBER legal questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the country . While the current language minimizes many of those risks , future legislative action must ensure that the codification in statute of express military detention authority does not carry unintended consequences that could compromise our ability to protect the American people .

Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ?

Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right ( negative freedom ) or far-left ( positive freedom ) social politics . But since , neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject , it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents , objectives and constraints . Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them .

23663	"Well , here's the rub : it's not really sensible to talk about the mass of an individual  bound  nucleon ; the mass you refer to ( where a proton weighs a little less than a neutron ) is for a  free  neutron or proton . When nucleons come together to form a nucleus , the process gives off energy - - and the system loses a corresponding amount of mass ( E = mc ^ NUMBER ) . So if you think about the "" mass "" of a proton in a carbon-NUMBER nucleus , it is smaller than for a hydrogen-NUMBER nucleus ( i . e . a free proton ) . This is what is referred to as the "" mass defect "" and , when you convert it to energy , indicates the "" binding energy "" for the nucleus ( which is the energy it would take to blast the nucleus apart into its component free nucleons ) . So what you should think about is that when you have a beta decay , the creation of the emitted particle consumes a fraction of the energy released by moving a nucleon ( and thus the nucleus ) to a lower energy state . The rest of that energy is usually carried off as kinetic energy ( of the beta particle / neutrino / nucleus / Auger electron ) and / or a gamma ray . In fact , this interchange of mass and energy is what enables us to predict whether a nuclear decay will occur ! If the decay decreases the total mass ( of the nucleus plus any particles it emits ) , we know that it also releases energy and thus is moving "" downhill "" towards a more stable system with a higher binding energy ."

24798	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since NUMBER ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know ,  anywhere else on the map !  Seriously , if you just went NUMBER-NUMBER blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since NUMBER , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at [ this ] ( URL thread on Barhah.com . We would breach the barricades and get a few kills , but for a full week , the survivors would beat us back out and cade up again . You also talk about zombie victories as if they're a new thing . They're not . Hell , the only major survivor victories I can think of are Giddings and Caiger I and II . They shouldn't be particularly surprising in a freakin ' zombie apocalypse . You say that zombies are OP , but the only reason zombies have any success is coordination . I've never seen a survivor strike team that focuses on clearing out buildings and securing them , but the major hordes each have at least one strike team . You're also forgetting the single biggest part of the AP balance . Barricades are a NUMBER : NUMBER AP advantage for survivors . This makes it a lot easier to play as a lone survivor — you can easily get a building up to EHB or find someone else's safehouse within NUMBER AP . It's a lot harder for a lone feral zombie to open up a building or find one that's already open , and it's practically impossible to open up an EHB building alone , especially for a low-level . Urban Dead has historically had a survivor advantage , aside from when the megahordes ( Shacknews , LUE , and the Dead ) show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( URL greatest proportion of level NUMBER players are military , and NUMBER % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead .   That is not Urban Dead .   Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually  try to survive  . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

24899	If you're above the cutoff , then don't sweat . I'd say prove yourself by taking more advanced courses and doing well . You're close to the average , so no worries  Clinical programs tend to be more like medical programs than do other psych programs - they're more about the numbers . So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website  Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program  I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US .

I think it's important that you focus on your leg strenh and reaction time . Our goalies do land drills with tennis balls to work on their reaction time . For example , stand facing a wall , a few feet away , and get someone to stand behind you . Get them to toss the tennis ball at the wall so it bounces back towards you , and you can try to catch it . That will help you with your hand / eye coordination , and your reaction time . And they do leg strenhening with jumping drills in the water . For example , have your coach hold a stick , or pole above your head in the water , and have you jump to touch it while he moves it to different positions . As you get better he can move it higher / farther from you , and you can do it for longer periods of time . There are a lot of good American Universities that offer scholarships . If you're good ( which I'm sure you are  ) ) you'll get noticed with scouting . You could always make a highlight reel of some of your games . Get your parents , or a friend to video you playing and when you're getting ready to apply to University send those videos in  I'm not sure if any of this information is helpful - but I hope so  Keep training and working hard  Good luck  	NOT

24943	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was NUMBER ( I'm NUMBER now , going to be NUMBER on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in NUMBER ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top NUMBER % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around NUMBER-NUMBER hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took NUMBER-NUMBER hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

24960	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around NUMBER to cast NUMBER to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an NUMBER mana , NUMBER turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at NUMBER and NUMBER / NUMBER of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At NUMBER / NUMBER , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . NUMBER cast NUMBER equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider NUMBER cast NUMBER equip with + NUMBER / + NUMBER , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to NUMBER / NUMBER . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : NUMBER multicolored mana and NUMBER turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost NUMBER black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only . Sight Ward : Wouldn ’ t even be good if it cost NUMBER . Maybe cantrip it when it dies ? Vision Ward : Even worse than sight ward . Cantrip ’ ing it would still make it worse than a cantrip ’ d sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward . Warwick : Suffers from the exact same problems as corki , too complicated for an uncommon , will never find a place in constructed , but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity .	NOT

The story was so tacked on , and involved all of these supposedly major players in Rapture that we just never heard about in the first one , but should have . By that , I don't mean they left it out of the first one , I just mean that they really didn't seamlessly integrate them into the story of Rapture . Plus , the gameplay really faltered . Where they really improved upon the weapon / plasmid combat system by letting you switch back and forth on the fly and do combos , it was ruined by the fact that every combat scenario in the game can be summed up with "" Uh oh , you're locked in that large open room , and can't get out the other side . OH NO TONS AND TONS OF SPLICERS  You can't get out until you kill them all  "" No more sneaking down hallways , no more feeling hunted by the creepy babbling splicer whose voice bounces down the hallway so you can't tell where he is , no more feeling of being stalked by a spider slicer . Just large open rooms fighting waves of splicers all rushing you at once , like they were trying to make Bioshock : Serious Sam Edition . - The big redemption would be if you could get the DLC , Minerva's Den , but that apparently was never released for PC .

I got my folks together on the couch that night and flat out said if either of them didn't care to know about my life I was happy to just not talk about it any more . Mom cried , Dad got upset and apologized , then Mom gave Dad the evil eye . Ten years later , my whole family is okay ( or flat out happy ) , Dad is my go-to guy for advice .

Belgravia  Belgravia is to the south-west of Buckingham Palace . It is known for its expensive hotels and is considered by the rich to be a desirable place to live . There are many embassies are in the area . Belgravia is generally quiet and is a great area to walk around and admire the Georgian houses . There are also a number of exclusive shops , restaurants and attractive pubs .  Bloomsbury  Bloomsbury is London's literary district . This district , a world within itself , is bound roughly by Euston Road to the north , Gower Street to the west , and Clerkenwell to the east . It is , among other things , the academic heart of London .  Camden  Shoppers and people-watchers flock from far away to crowd the streets and chill out at Camden Market . Good cafes and clubs make Camden much more than a great market area .  Canary Wharf  , on the Isle of Dogs , is the heart of  Docklands  . This NUMBER-hectare ( NUMBER-acre ) site is dominated by a 240m - high ( NUMBER-ft . ) tower , which is the tallest building in the United Kingdom , and was designed by César Pelli . The Piazza of the tower is lined with shops and restaurants .  Chelsea  Once a center of innovation in the 19th century when the area was a veritable Victorian artists ' colony , the Beatles and the Rolling Stones lived in the neighborhood that has since lost in youth culture and settled into a small town atmosphere in the midst of the huge city . Chelsea is famous for the King's Road for the bohemian sixties and punks in the 1970s . It's a wealthy area like Kensinon and Knightsbridge .  City of London ( The Square Mile )  The first settlement of Roman conquerors , The City is now the soul of the world's financial markets . Modern structures like the Lloyd's Building may outnumber ancient buildings such as the Bank of England and the Old Bailey but The City also holds the sacred St . Paul's Cathedral , Old Spitalfields Market , and Leadenhall Market and the modern Museum of London and Barbican Centre .  Clerkenwell  This neighborhood , north and a bit west of the City , was the site of London's first hospital and is the home of several early churches . St . Bartholomew-the-Great , built in NUMBER , still stands as London's oldest church and the best example of large-scale Norman building in the city . In the 18th century , Clerkenwell declined into a muck-filled cattle yard , home to cheap gin distilleries . During a 19th - century revival , John Stuart Mill's London Patriotic Club moved here in NUMBER , and William Morris's socialist press called Clerkenwell home in the 1890s - - Lenin worked here editing Iskra . The neighborhood again fell into disrepair but has recently been reinvented by the moneyed and groovy . A handful of hot restaurants and clubs have sprung up , and art galleries line St . John's Square and the border of Clerkenwell Green . Lest you think the whole area has become trendy , know that trucks still rumble into Smithfield Market throughout the night , unloading thousands of beef carcasses .  Covent Garden  Covent Garden's Piazza has daily open-air entertainment .

Stroll down Long Acre , Floral Street and the cobbled Neal Street or visit the Royal Opera House . Neal's Yard is the center for healthy food and alternative therapies .  Docklands  In NUMBER , in the most ambitious scheme of its kind in Europe , the London Docklands Development Corporation ( LDDC ) was formed to redevelop Wapping , the Isle of Dogs , the Royal Docks , and Surrey Docks . The area is bordered roughly by Tower Bridge to the west and London City Airport and the Royal Docks to the east .  The East End  Traditionally , this was one of London's poorest districts , nearly bombed out of existence during World War II . The East End extends east from the City Walls , encompassing Stepney , Bow , Poplar , West Ham , Canning Town , and other districts . These days , many immigrants to London make their homes in the East End . London is pushing eastward . Today you'll find lots of trendy bars , clubs , restaurants , and boutiques or vintage clothing outlets here . Much of the fashionable life is found around Hoxton Square and its peripheries , such as Shoreditch and the northern half of Brick Lane . There is an array of contemporary galleries in the area . Attractions you may want to visit if you're in the area include St . Clement Danes church , the Temple of Mithras , and Sir Christopher Wren's Monument to the Great Fire of NUMBER .  Greenwich  Known by most as the center of Greenwich Mean Time at zero degrees longitude , come visit the National Maritime Museum , the imposing Old Royal Naval College , Cutty Sark , and Greenwich Park .  Hampstead  Thick with literary history , you'll find homes of poets , playwrights and actors of past and present marked by endless blue plaques ( to show where someone famous once lived ) .

Holborn  The old borough of Holborn ( Ho-burn ) , which abuts the City southeast of Bloomsbury , encompasses the heart of legal London - - this is where you'll find the city's barristers , solicitors , and law clerks .

There are still enough attractions to support a good selection of hotels , pubs , B & Bs , cafes , and restaurants . South Kensinon has the ' Big Three ' museums : V & A , Natural History Museum and the Science Museum .  King's Cross  Long a seedy area in the heart of London , King's Cross is facing a massive regeneration program . Millions of pounds are going into its decaying infrastructure . The area is still far from chic , but was given renewed importance with the arrival of Eurostar , the Channel Tunnel Rail Link coming into St . Pancras instead of Waterloo . Because of this change in venue , it's estimated that some NUMBER million passengers will pass through King's Cross annually . Six tubes now convene underneath King's Cross Station , and it is the number-one connection hub enabling visitors to get to and from Gatwick and Heathrow airports .  Knightsbridge  One of the priciest and most exclusive areas in London known for upscale shops and restaurants . The stores are luxurious and the homes extravagant so walking through this area is a pleasure . Spend a couple hours exploring Harrods and then stop into one of the many restaurants or cafes to relax your sore feet .

Southwark  Shakespeare still appears at the famous Globe Theatre while Tate Modern boasts a shining cultural program . Stroll the riverside to Lambeth Palace , the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury or pay homage to cricket at the Oval .  Westminster  The British Empire , and once the world , was ruled from Whitehall . Royalty , government , and monumental London come together in the shadows of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament . Walk near the Kings and Queens buried in Westminster Abbey and take your own quiet stroll through St . James's Park and Green Park . Westminster also encompasses Victoria , an area that takes its name from bustling Victoria Station , "" the gateway to the Continent . "" Many B & Bs and hotels have sprouted up here because of the neighborhood's proximity to the rail station . Victoria is cheap and convenient if you don't mind the noise and crowds . Welfare recipients occupy many hotels along Belgrave Road . If you've arrived without a hotel reservation , you'll find the pickings better on the streets off Belgrave Road ."	NOT

In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises .

26439	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section NUMBER ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections NUMBER-NUMBER needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section NUMBER as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections NUMBER-NUMBER continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section NUMBER renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year NUMBER to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section NUMBER modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section NUMBER , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections NUMBER and NUMBER operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section NUMBER requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the NUMBER Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section NUMBER before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section NUMBER could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section NUMBER in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section NUMBER requires the President to submit a report to the Congress NUMBER days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section NUMBER further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section NUMBER in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections NUMBER , NUMBER , NUMBER , and NUMBER could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections NUMBER , NUMBER , and NUMBER would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section NUMBER , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

27016	How do you get PvE gear ? A good start is just to PvP and trade Warzone Commendations for Mercenary Commendation and buy CHAMPION GEAR BAGS ( NUMBER / NUMBER of each commendation ) . You can get lucky and get PvP modded gear that is ilvl NUMBER ( mods ) . Otherwise crafting is really good , take green level NUMBER items and reverse engineer them to the artifact quality . Get really good rolls and you can get triple secondary stats on them - only really sacrificing a bit of the main stats . Which to be honest isn't super big deal losing NUMBER STR when you gain NUMBER PWR instead . What's a Flashpoint and how do you find them ? Flashpoints are instances that are NUMBER-mans and have their own story and bosses , generally dropping better loot than quest rewards or crafting . You can find them in the Fleet stations , generally in the Drop Station of each larger ship . There are two on Ilum . What's the difference between a hardmode and a normal ? Boss ability wise there seems to be no difference between normal and hard-mode with the exception of a couple bosses now spawning adds . The major and most important difference is that every boss now gains an ENRAGE timer ( + NUMBER % DMG ) . So most of the bosses become a DPS race and healers should be DPSing whenever possible ( I recommend telling your tank to blow a cooldowns and bursting a good amount in that time frame ) . Most of the bosses are pretty easy and not super different from normal mode , some of their ability do not even increase in the amount of damage  Trash is much much more difficult , highly recommend CC . Anything with a bestial animal seems to do crazy amount of damage as well as the elite robots not being a joke . How do you get gear tokens ? Final bosses in hard-mode flash points drop Columi gear token which seems to be the early raid equivalent . Otherwise as stated above CHAMPION GEAR BAGs house the PvP gear which is an excellent as well as solo-able gear up process . How do you get PVP gear ? ( And highend PVP gear ) By doing Warzones  Stack up commendations ( NUMBER is the current cap of every commendation it seems ) , while leveling and PvPing you can get an entire gear set from the Fleet PvP vendors at levels NUMBER and NUMBER . If you have excess Warzone commendations convert it to Mercenary Commendations to prepare for an easier time gearing up at level-NUMBER . Gear bags contain either A ) NUMBER Centurion Commendations B ) NUMBER Centurion Commendation AND NUMBER Token for Champion level gear . Centurion commendations are used to buy the lesser Artifact gear for level NUMBER . There is also two PvP dailies as well as two Weekly quests . ( Win NUMBER Warzones & NUMBER Warefforts for the daily . ) ( Win NUMBER Warzone & NUMBER War efforts for the weekly ) Completing these will give you NUMBER bags per day and NUMBER per week . War efforts is taking part of Ilum PvP which is the far West part of the planet , you must destroy the enemy tank walkers and their battle station ( OR repair your turret at the base - there's a console at the base of the turret which fixes it ) Where are the daily quest hubs ? You must finish your main class story to do dailies , at least I'm fairly sure . First hub is in Ilum , there is another hub on Belvaius - generally someone in fleet will have a new quest informing you they need aid at a certain planet .	NOT

28680	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level NUMBER you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level NUMBER blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level NUMBER max backstab provides about NUMBER-NUMBER extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier NUMBER towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

When I was about twelve , I went to the county fair and saw a booth where they had rabbits for sale , including this huge specimen for $ NUMBER , probably a Flemish Giant or Chinchilla , in retrospect , though specific details of appearance escape me . Anyway , I positively begged my mother to let me buy it with my accumulated allowance , but she refused ... wisely comprehending that I was more eager to possess the rabbit than to care for it .

It's brilliantly well-done for an indie multiplayer game . I also forgot to mention that there is a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic when it comes to classes and the special types of zombies .

Ron Paul - Bill of rights URL  If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place .    Ron Paul lying about the Constitution   The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history ,   churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . ""   Ron Paul on sexual harassment   "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended ,   but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . ""   Ron Paul - We the people act   The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , ""  including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

29922	I have good news for you then: your kids will only become fat if you're a bad parent and feed them crap food. And you wouldn't do that, would you?	EXP
29923	I feel sorry for Finland, poor Finnish people dealing with a fatty that repulsive.	EXP
29924	Fats are so sexually frustrated they go for incest.	EXP
29925	Check the twitter account . They're normally good with saying when the servers are down ... It happens more than it should . ( I'm also on xbox )	NOT
29926	that is true love.  people seem to think it means accept me for becoming a slob, a bitch, a shitty person and a lazy entitled asshole.	EXP

29928	Sent	IMP
29929	Its all lean mass though.	IMP
29930	I've always thought that but I was just unsure really!	IMP
29931	Being cheated on even ONCE is all the reason you need to never speak to that traitorous piece of shit again. Who the fuck forgives treason?	EXP
29932	That is not the same person.	IMP
29933	If she wears a NUMBER band, she's fat, bro	IMP
29934	"Oh, so is this the ""wonderful personality"" that fat subhumans and their dumbass enablers keep squealing about?"	EXP
29935	Would you like HL2 or Day of Defeat : Source for Borderlands GOTY ?	NOT
29936	Hahaha, you're an idiot. Spend more time in the free-weight section, maybe you'll know what you're talking about.	EXP
29937	I was expecting the shitlord on the left, but apparently WW has no standards.	IMP
29938	I'm tall,so they're never long enough in the torso, and they just get eaten by the vagina monster:(	EXP
29939	Yeah I don't think she has that.	IMP
29940	So.. uh.... What's SRD?	IMP
29941	She's a disgusting wastepile of an adult whose kid will also be a Munter and have to deal with this kind of damage. If it's lucky...more likely it will turn into her.	EXP

29945	I pirate all the time it just saves me money so I can buy weed rofl	NOT
29946	It definitely sounds like you're trying to do too much . A turning point for me was when I learnt to ' play to your hand ' and not to what you might get later . Say you've got NUMBER cards in your hand , have a decent NUMBER-cost world you'd like to put down and maybe say Replicant Robots ( NUMBER-cost dev ) . If dev . gets picked by another player but settle doesn't then you need to get that replicant robots down and sacrifice the world . On the flip side if settle gets picked you're probably best served sacrificing the Replicant Robots . You're only harming yourself if you're skipping phases picked by others early on without doing anything in order to gather cards . They'll make the most of what they put down while you're trying to build up some master play in one hand that will still take NUMBER or NUMBER rounds to get down and more rounds after to get working .	NOT
29947	As an employer I would never hire a fatty. They are the physical manifistation of laziness and lack of motivation, why would I want that working for me?	EXP
29948	I'm going to guess universal studios? Doesn't surprise me	IMP
29949	Gotta be fucking kidding me, no one believes this.	EXP
29950	I think it's because We Are The Music  Makers  ... I also think a lot of musicians are more insecure and self absorbed than they might admit . How dare someone  else  actually produce a song ! ?	NOT
29951	Hah, yeah, the older models here were designed like that. First time I saw it, all I could think was it was the same as the truck that delivered my car, but with a shed on it.	EXP
29952	Broke up with my girlfriend of six years . Now we're both alone on new years eve and I feel pretty terrible . I did the breaking up but I wish it didn't have to be like this :(	NOT
29953	It seriously looks like her arms are diseased and need to be amputated.	IMP
29954	They're so immature as child like to take offense from his factual answer.	IMP
29955	"Let me guess, after you broke up he started whinging that, ""the bitch friend zoned me!""?"	EXP

29961	I wish they were synonymous.	EXP
29962	If I was a guy, I'd rather fuck rhinos at the zoo than stick my dick into something like what's pictured. Even if I got caught with my pants down, I'd be less embarrassed.	EXP

29966	How is your boyfriend telling you that youre fat worse than realizing that you don't fit in your pants anymore.	IMP
29967	That sounds good.	IMP
29968	Omfg you got NUMBER.NUMBER $ for free   !	NOT
29969	I am very surprised this was the response from the government from the beginning . Next we'll hear about how reporters were kicked out of so and so by the military , then we will never hear about this again and the world will forget about this issue until Putin has squashed the rebellion and arrested thousands of protestors .	NOT
29970	Upsets me as well. The military is practically the image of our nation and lards tainting it hurts more than their diabetes.	IMP
29971	She couldn't sing for shit, all the blubber crushing her throat I suppose.	EXP
29972	It doesn't make sense.  Least I explained why.	IMP

29980	Fat cunt telling us we need to work on ourselves. What a joke.	EXP

29982	I had this happen to me a lot in high school . Got pissed off every time .	NOT
29983	Fat people seem to confuse being ignored with being shamed. Truly, most people aren't mean; they just don't give a fuck.	EXP

29989	The sooner people just stop posting about this shit, the sooner its NUMBER minutes will be over.	EXP
29990	As a radiography student who has to x-ray fat pelvises and hips every day, I agree. Her pelvis would be higher, it's always higher than you expect, especially on fat women who carry all their weight in their thighs and asses.	IMP
29991	Luckily it wasn't out of empathy, just in general I'll often look away from embarrassment	IMP
