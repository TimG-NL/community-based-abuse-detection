457	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around NUMBER to cast NUMBER to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an NUMBER mana , NUMBER turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at NUMBER and NUMBER / NUMBER of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At NUMBER / NUMBER , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . NUMBER cast NUMBER equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider NUMBER cast NUMBER equip with + NUMBER / + NUMBER , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to NUMBER / NUMBER . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : NUMBER multicolored mana and NUMBER turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost NUMBER black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only .

1379	I'm voting for Obama for reasons other people here have described .

For the GOP , I honestly like Gingrich the most . Not that I agree with Gingrich's views , and I wouldn't vote for him in the general election , but I respect him and like his personality . He's clearly the smartest guy in the room and actually tries to grapple with ideas , even if those ideas may be wrong . He has flair and is a great speaker . One of his favorite books is Isaac Asimov's  The Foundation Trilogy  and he warns about the dangers of EMP weapons . I mean , come on . He's crazy and fun . Edit : I should say Jon Huntsman is arguably the best candidate , and from a strictly utilitarian view , I'd support him over the other Republicans . But given that he's going nowhere , I'm going to pull for Gingrich in the primaries for my own perverted and weird reasons .	NOT

2346	"> You do realize that animals eat plants , right ? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten ? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ?  We don't need to be eating plants  We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) > Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . > You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , NUMBER % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology . We have the audacity to take that for granted ."	NOT

If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children .

3499	I'm not sure of the exact timeline , but I know I was already showing signs of development around NUMBER .

I had strong muscular legs , and I literally had the perfect body for a girl five years older than me . So , when I was in fifth grade , my older cousin Rich was graduating from high school in my district . He was a popular football player from an unusually successful iteration of our school's football team . He had a lot of friends . As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation , there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends . I was NUMBER years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure . But later she told me they had to tell Rich's friend I was only NUMBER . Cue about two or three years of wearing baggy t-shirts and wide legged jeans .	NOT

3757	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

Another symptom of the magical chemo is his apparent constant feeling of chills . seriously , even the dark lord is going to get a little muggy feeling wearing black robes in the middle of July . so I think maybe Voldemort just wanted to not day of cancer .  we can safely assume the Dark Lord did not have pancreatic cancer . judging by his weak voice cancer of the lungs or larynx seems like a reasonable possibility .

4248	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section NUMBER ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections NUMBER-NUMBER needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section NUMBER as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections NUMBER-NUMBER continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section NUMBER renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year NUMBER to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section NUMBER modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section NUMBER , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections NUMBER and NUMBER operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section NUMBER requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the NUMBER Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section NUMBER before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section NUMBER could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section NUMBER in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section NUMBER requires the President to submit a report to the Congress NUMBER days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section NUMBER further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section NUMBER in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections NUMBER , NUMBER , NUMBER , and NUMBER could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections NUMBER , NUMBER , and NUMBER would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section NUMBER , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

4741	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight . The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities . Most players don't recognize when the game is tipped in their favor ( IE someone on the enemy team got caught and died ) and fail to make moves on towers and neutral monsters when the enemy team either cannot respond or would be at significant disadvantage in doing so . Bad players , when in the NUMBER-NUMBER advantage , will opt to continue farming , wander aimlessly looking for farm , or B + shop at substantial health . Here's some example logic in which a team has NUMBER-NUMBER advantage and should opt to take dragon / baron or push towers , in that order .  DISCLAIMER :  This is very general . The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron . The exceptions to this line of logic occur most often when your team has been feeding and enemies cannot be dealt with even 5v4 . - - - GUIDE - - - Hau NUMBER Taek Neutral Dagrons after 10mins ( or 20mins for Baron Dagron ) - - -    - IF -   The number of people dead on their team > number of people dead on your team   - THEN -   group & move immediately to a dagron .    - IF -   enemy doesn't respond by also immediately moving to a dagron   - THEN -   begin fighting dagron .    - IF -   enemy moves in during your dagron killings - AND - team is still in good health   - THEN -   engage enemy for an easy teamfight win and extended time in the advantage .   - OTHERWISE -   back out and let them try to take it .

The authorities granted by the AUMF , including the detention authority , are essential to our ability to protect the American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces , and have enabled us to confront the full range of threats this country faces from those organizations and individuals .   Because the authorities codified in this section already exist , the Administration does not believe codification is necessary   and poses some risk . After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention authority , Congress must be careful not to open a whole new series of NUMBER legal questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the country . While the current language minimizes many of those risks , future legislative action must ensure that the codification in statute of express military detention authority does not carry unintended consequences that could compromise our ability to protect the American people . So the White House thought they already had these powers and just didn't want them to actually be defined by law ...	NOT

6490	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are NUMBER % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since NUMBER the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe NUMBER-NUMBER years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

6582	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off NUMBER % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

6806	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks . Male Hollywood already knows that chick flicks are soul-sucking monstrosities that should be taken out back and shot . Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering URL Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at  you  , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we   are   slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

How far this will go is beyond me to be honest , but it feels like a collapse in all we are accustomed to already . I see our country falling into a quasi police state . I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since NUMBER has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in NUMBER I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then . I didn't like the Patriot Act , but the sunset clause made it ok . I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant . I also understood why President Bush sought to go to Iraq versus waiting for more to come here . He was providing targets for potential terrorist in their sand box so our children could be safe . I didn't like it , but it was a solution I could accept . I moved as far away from the city as possible to avoid anymore planes falling out of the sky and tried to forget about the national nightmare that could have killed most of my family . ( My step dad was supposed to be on guard at the Pentagon , My grandmother and grandfather lived in Somerset with my sister at the time . ) Then I learned about peak oil . I thought , so what we have at least NUMBER years left . I explained away any concerns that nagged at me , until suddenly one day ... I think NUMBER or so I thought about all of it . I realized this was not the world I grew up in , and due to things beyond my control may never be . I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience . I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain . Then I stopped thinking about the past . I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own . I changed the way I lived . I lowered expenses . I learned to cook and bake . Then I learned to grow a few foods . I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the NUMBER dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden . When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food , he changed the old bathroom into a pantry . This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store NUMBER months of food for our family . We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country . If not , my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways . We could have kept on doing what we always have . I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad . I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received . I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than NUMBER washings . I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline . I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat .

Gear is similar to lowest level PvP sets you can find on fleet pvp vendor ( centurion ? ) Daily PvE quests on Ilum require hours of time if solo - NPCs are tougher than on other planets .

Regardless of the backlash , and the lack of funding for the military , doing away with NUMBER amendments to the bill of rights IS MUCH WORSE  MICRO EDIT : I realize I have forgotten years of classes on American history and government , many which informed me that a veto is not going to fling us into some state of unrest , and that the implied urgency is only there to convince us it had to happen . END EDIT . He's not your buddy , he isn't on our side , start looking at him as the man with more power than anyone else in the world , and realize if he wants to , which he does since he requested the provisions , he could detain you for life due to whatever he sees fit as a reason . EDIT : I'd also like to mention , although my post is more feeling than thought , I spent a good month following this bill , have actually read it , and as such , know all the fancy revisions just made the wording more muddled . I encourage you to not be alienated by my inflammatory post , and instead , read the offending section of the law for yourself , as well as some analysis from lawyers . Seriously . Regardless of what you think about this issue , regardless of whether you normally research things before you opine on them , this is the time to do it . BIG EDIT : I've never had more posts to reply to than I have the time to , and honestly , I'm impressed , a lot of you know your history . Granted , a lot of you are treating this like a game of football . What matters isn't what is right or wrong , you and I , regardless of where in the world we are , are now in a struggle against worldwide tyranny , or far worse , the full on destruction of our only planet . You need to be aware that there is a lot of uncertainty to all of this . We aren't sure what any of these people are planning , just that their methods to reach their plans have moved away from the common interest of all humans . I do not know what will happen , as I've never witnessed tyranny first hand , all I know is that if we do nothing , we can assume the worst will happen . But , if we act now , and protest , and let those we interact with know how we feel on this issue , and debate , and discuss , and improve our thoughts , as we have been on reddit , we have a chance of turning the tide . The closest way to that solution I see now is what Occupy is , it's what the hippie movement was , it's a movement for human actualization , let's try to not fuck it up this time with the drugs and anti-establishment message , and make this a message all humans want to be a part of . This is more important than all of that . We need a new constitution that reflects our greater understanding of humanity , as the founders gathered to develop years ago .	NOT

You're close to the average , so no worries  Clinical programs tend to be more like medical programs than do other psych programs - they're more about the numbers . So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website  Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program  I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US .

8352	"The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited . Ron Paul - Bill of rights URL  If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place .    Ron Paul lying about the Constitution   The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history ,   churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . ""   Ron Paul on sexual harassment   "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended ,   but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . ""   Ron Paul - We the people act   The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , ""  including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

8724	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : URL Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

9134	I had actually forgotten about that . I do know a little about this stuff , emphasis on the ' little ' . Without doing any googling , what I remember about the mini-shuttle is that is was a testbed for the SR-NUMBER follow-on , sometimes known as the ' Aurora ' , and not intended as a production craft . I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR-NUMBER getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

9249	I never understood why he caught so much flack for this . I mean , yeah , he's wearing fucking fishnets , a wig , and stilettos . But , you can clearly tell that in the first picture with the gloves , that he is just messing around ( hence the boxing stance ) . In the second picture , with the wig , he is clearly holding a drink , giving us the impression that he may have been drunk .

9251	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about NUMBER creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding NUMBER Razorverge Thicket and NUMBER more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

9573	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from NUMBER up to NUMBER + , your only option is to cast a higher  quantity  of spells rather than improving the  quality  of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

9580	Bi in particular is an unbelievably broad term . It simplifies infinitely many possible sexualities into a single word , based on the premise that sexuality is defined solely by the genitals people enjoy having sex with . Which is completely irrelevant to me , and I'm sure I'm not the only one .

9698	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for  why  it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

But when I see a cop standing in the rain at an intersection directing traffic , I feel differently . Getting sloshed at home isn't illegal . Do it in public and you've got a problem , not that I agree it should be a problem . I understand the nature or policing people . I'm huge about minding your own business .

9931	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that   we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it  easier  to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' .   That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am  not  saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM   !

10635	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since NUMBER ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know ,  anywhere else on the map !  Seriously , if you just went NUMBER-NUMBER blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since NUMBER , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at [ this ] ( URL thread on Barhah.com . We would breach the barricades and get a few kills , but for a full week , the survivors would beat us back out and cade up again . You also talk about zombie victories as if they're a new thing . They're not . Hell , the only major survivor victories I can think of are Giddings and Caiger I and II . They shouldn't be particularly surprising in a freakin ' zombie apocalypse . You say that zombies are OP , but the only reason zombies have any success is coordination . I've never seen a survivor strike team that focuses on clearing out buildings and securing them , but the major hordes each have at least one strike team . You're also forgetting the single biggest part of the AP balance . Barricades are a NUMBER : NUMBER AP advantage for survivors . This makes it a lot easier to play as a lone survivor — you can easily get a building up to EHB or find someone else's safehouse within NUMBER AP . It's a lot harder for a lone feral zombie to open up a building or find one that's already open , and it's practically impossible to open up an EHB building alone , especially for a low-level . Urban Dead has historically had a survivor advantage , aside from when the megahordes ( Shacknews , LUE , and the Dead ) show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( URL greatest proportion of level NUMBER players are military , and NUMBER % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead .   That is not Urban Dead .   Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually  try to survive  . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

10964	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : NUMBER . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . NUMBER . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . NUMBER . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT

You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people .

I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance , but in any case , it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person , in fact , part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values .

11966	"No ... you're confusing the size of the money supply with the ability of the bank to make loans . Fractional reserve banking increases the size of the money supply ( i . e . amount of money in circulation ) but it doesn't let a bank lend out money it doesn't actually have .  When we both deposit 200k in bank NUMBER , bank NUMBER can make a loan of up to $ 200k . Someone comes along and borrows 200k - this person may deposit 50k of that money into bank NUMBER , therefore allowing bank NUMBER to make out of a loan of $ 50k . This $ NUMBER . 4m number ( or whatever it is ) assumes three things , which aren't necessarily true :  All loan proceeds are deposited back into bank accounts - which makes no sense , people take loans to buy things like cars and houses and pay off credit cards . In reality the money filters through the economy and may eventually end up at a bank anywhere in the world  Any loan proceeds deposited into a bank account must be deposited with the same bank that made the original loan - which probably won't happen , given there are thousands of banks in the US , let alone the world . i . e . if bank NUMBER made a loan of 200k , there's no guarantee the 50k deposit would be with bank NUMBER , it's more likely to be elsewhere .  No reserve ratio There is definitely some element of this happening ( i . e . loan proceeds becoming bank deposits at other banks ) , but the Federal Reserve puts brakes on lending by dictating reserve requirements for banks ( i . e . what fraction of deposits must be held at the Fed , the "" fractional "" in fractional reserve ) . Thus , the $ NUMBER . 4m thing never happens - maybe the money supply is inflated to $ 300k or $ 400k depending on reserve requirements , but this is split amongst many banks and potentially countries . Bank NUMBER is not going on a crazy lending spree . In economics this whole concept is called the multiplier effect of money . This lending / deposit / lending cycle has increased the size of the money supply , but it hasn't actually let bank NUMBER make $ NUMBER . 4m in loans .   Yes , a bank can monetize future loan cashflows & package this as a securitized bond , and then use the proceeds of this securitized bond to make more loans - that happens all the time with mortgages - but really now , that's far beyond this topic "	NOT

You could try alternate means of communicating with him ( e-mail , letter , notes ) or you can try to prepare yourself so that you when you do address the issue , you can speak with him in a non-emotional way . This will bring the issues to light and hopefully keep yourself from getting emotionally involved because it sounds like he does not have the best tools for communicating about his own feelings , much less yours . That said , I am going to echo penguintaxi's comment that a sex-positive counsellor could do a lot of good . Good luck !	NOT

12160	Oh you play ? Yay  That's so cool  I'm not a goalie unfortunately . But I have seen our goalies doing a lot of fun drills . I think it's important that you focus on your leg strenh and reaction time . Our goalies do land drills with tennis balls to work on their reaction time . For example , stand facing a wall , a few feet away , and get someone to stand behind you . Get them to toss the tennis ball at the wall so it bounces back towards you , and you can try to catch it . That will help you with your hand / eye coordination , and your reaction time . And they do leg strenhening with jumping drills in the water . For example , have your coach hold a stick , or pole above your head in the water , and have you jump to touch it while he moves it to different positions . As you get better he can move it higher / farther from you , and you can do it for longer periods of time . There are a lot of good American Universities that offer scholarships . If you're good ( which I'm sure you are  ) ) you'll get noticed with scouting . You could always make a highlight reel of some of your games . Get your parents , or a friend to video you playing and when you're getting ready to apply to University send those videos in  I'm not sure if any of this information is helpful - but I hope so  Keep training and working hard  Good luck  	NOT

Chelsea  Once a center of innovation in the 19th century when the area was a veritable Victorian artists ' colony , the Beatles and the Rolling Stones lived in the neighborhood that has since lost in youth culture and settled into a small town atmosphere in the midst of the huge city . Chelsea is famous for the King's Road for the bohemian sixties and punks in the 1970s . It's a wealthy area like Kensinon and Knightsbridge .  City of London ( The Square Mile )  The first settlement of Roman conquerors , The City is now the soul of the world's financial markets .

Paul's Cathedral , Old Spitalfields Market , and Leadenhall Market and the modern Museum of London and Barbican Centre .  Clerkenwell  This neighborhood , north and a bit west of the City , was the site of London's first hospital and is the home of several early churches . St . Bartholomew-the-Great , built in NUMBER , still stands as London's oldest church and the best example of large-scale Norman building in the city . In the 18th century , Clerkenwell declined into a muck-filled cattle yard , home to cheap gin distilleries . During a 19th - century revival , John Stuart Mill's London Patriotic Club moved here in NUMBER , and William Morris's socialist press called Clerkenwell home in the 1890s - - Lenin worked here editing Iskra .

South Kensinon has the ' Big Three ' museums : V & A , Natural History Museum and the Science Museum .  King's Cross  Long a seedy area in the heart of London , King's Cross is facing a massive regeneration program . Millions of pounds are going into its decaying infrastructure . The area is still far from chic , but was given renewed importance with the arrival of Eurostar , the Channel Tunnel Rail Link coming into St . Pancras instead of Waterloo . Because of this change in venue , it's estimated that some NUMBER million passengers will pass through King's Cross annually . Six tubes now convene underneath King's Cross Station , and it is the number-one connection hub enabling visitors to get to and from Gatwick and Heathrow airports .  Knightsbridge  One of the priciest and most exclusive areas in London known for upscale shops and restaurants . The stores are luxurious and the homes extravagant so walking through this area is a pleasure . Spend a couple hours exploring Harrods and then stop into one of the many restaurants or cafes to relax your sore feet .

Southwark  Shakespeare still appears at the famous Globe Theatre while Tate Modern boasts a shining cultural program . Stroll the riverside to Lambeth Palace , the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury or pay homage to cricket at the Oval .  Westminster  The British Empire , and once the world , was ruled from Whitehall . Royalty , government , and monumental London come together in the shadows of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament . Walk near the Kings and Queens buried in Westminster Abbey and take your own quiet stroll through St . James's Park and Green Park . Westminster also encompasses Victoria , an area that takes its name from bustling Victoria Station , "" the gateway to the Continent . "" Many B & Bs and hotels have sprouted up here because of the neighborhood's proximity to the rail station . Victoria is cheap and convenient if you don't mind the noise and crowds . Welfare recipients occupy many hotels along Belgrave Road . If you've arrived without a hotel reservation , you'll find the pickings better on the streets off Belgrave Road ."	NOT

13415	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are NUMBER % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

13714	How do you get PvE gear ? A good start is just to PvP and trade Warzone Commendations for Mercenary Commendation and buy CHAMPION GEAR BAGS ( NUMBER / NUMBER of each commendation ) . You can get lucky and get PvP modded gear that is ilvl NUMBER ( mods ) . Otherwise crafting is really good , take green level NUMBER items and reverse engineer them to the artifact quality . Get really good rolls and you can get triple secondary stats on them - only really sacrificing a bit of the main stats . Which to be honest isn't super big deal losing NUMBER STR when you gain NUMBER PWR instead . What's a Flashpoint and how do you find them ? Flashpoints are instances that are NUMBER-mans and have their own story and bosses , generally dropping better loot than quest rewards or crafting . You can find them in the Fleet stations , generally in the Drop Station of each larger ship . There are two on Ilum . What's the difference between a hardmode and a normal ? Boss ability wise there seems to be no difference between normal and hard-mode with the exception of a couple bosses now spawning adds . The major and most important difference is that every boss now gains an ENRAGE timer ( + NUMBER % DMG ) . So most of the bosses become a DPS race and healers should be DPSing whenever possible ( I recommend telling your tank to blow a cooldowns and bursting a good amount in that time frame ) . Most of the bosses are pretty easy and not super different from normal mode , some of their ability do not even increase in the amount of damage  Trash is much much more difficult , highly recommend CC . Anything with a bestial animal seems to do crazy amount of damage as well as the elite robots not being a joke . How do you get gear tokens ? Final bosses in hard-mode flash points drop Columi gear token which seems to be the early raid equivalent . Otherwise as stated above CHAMPION GEAR BAGs house the PvP gear which is an excellent as well as solo-able gear up process . How do you get PVP gear ? ( And highend PVP gear ) By doing Warzones  Stack up commendations ( NUMBER is the current cap of every commendation it seems ) , while leveling and PvPing you can get an entire gear set from the Fleet PvP vendors at levels NUMBER and NUMBER . If you have excess Warzone commendations convert it to Mercenary Commendations to prepare for an easier time gearing up at level-NUMBER . Gear bags contain either A ) NUMBER Centurion Commendations B ) NUMBER Centurion Commendation AND NUMBER Token for Champion level gear . Centurion commendations are used to buy the lesser Artifact gear for level NUMBER . There is also two PvP dailies as well as two Weekly quests . ( Win NUMBER Warzones & NUMBER Warefforts for the daily . ) ( Win NUMBER Warzone & NUMBER War efforts for the weekly ) Completing these will give you NUMBER bags per day and NUMBER per week . War efforts is taking part of Ilum PvP which is the far West part of the planet , you must destroy the enemy tank walkers and their battle station ( OR repair your turret at the base - there's a console at the base of the turret which fixes it ) Where are the daily quest hubs ? You must finish your main class story to do dailies , at least I'm fairly sure . First hub is in Ilum , there is another hub on Belvaius - generally someone in fleet will have a new quest informing you they need aid at a certain planet .	NOT

14045	From simple.wikipedia.org - Conductors usually beat time with their right hand . This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries ( when they start playing ) or to show them to play louder or softer . Most conductors have a stick called a “ baton ” . It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat . Other conductors prefer not to use a baton . A conductor stands on a small platform called a “ rostrum ” . To be a good conductor is not easy . It is not just a question of giving a steady beat . A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes . They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make . They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants . Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals . They make everything clear through the way they conduct . In short , they are showing the musicians the beat of the song , and telling different sections when it's time for them to get louder or softer , or pointing out whether or not they are too loud or two soft , among many other things .

In other words , it is necessary to learn to call into doubt the values , prejudices and interpretations of events that we learn throughout our upbringings .

Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things .

14593	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level NUMBER you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level NUMBER blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level NUMBER max backstab provides about NUMBER-NUMBER extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier NUMBER towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

14605	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following :  The training and certification that teachers go through .  Thereby , the recommended teaching methods .  The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability .  A broad control over what  gets  taught , in the form of a curriculum .  A teacher's  conduct  , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would  you  like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in  general  are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit   or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered .   While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it .

I firmly believe that the holocaust DID happen , but I also believe that the number NUMBER million is absolute and total bullshit . Fun fact , did you know that holocaust-denial is a crime in most Western European countries ? Spain recently repealed their laws , joining the U . S . as a country where it is legal to have a differing opinion about history . If NUMBER million people really did get rounded up and exterminated by the Germans , then why go through such great lenhs , jailing men and women throughout Europe , to make sure NO ONE dissents ? If I was to say "" The American Civil War never happened  "" , people would look at me like I'm a loon , and I'd be shunned , but I wouldn't be thrown in JAIL  If I was to say "" The Armenian genocide never happened  "" , Turks would cheer me , Armenians would jeer me , but once again , I wouldn't be thrown in JAIL  Truth should not have to be enforced with a sword , a gun , a fine , or a jail sentence ."

16920	[ This NYT article ] ( URL helped me a lot :   Michele Bachmann   is the obvious choice for a true Tea Party believer , who wants a candidate to carry the banner of far right contempt for and alienation from Washinon . Other candidates try on the Tea Party tri-corn , but it doesn ’ t fit . Ms . Bachmann is the real deal – and for that reason , I think she has no chance of winning .   Rick Santorum   is the candidate for a Republican who places a high premium on strongly conservative social positions sincerely held . Mr . Santorum doesn ’ t just talk about these issues , he ’ s voted on them repeatedly . He is inflexibly opposed to a woman ’ s right to make decisions about her reproductive life . He is clearly religious but doesn ’ t exploit it like like Gov . Rick Perry , who wears his Christianity on his sleeve and across his shirts , like a Nike swoosh . And if you really care about abortion , as in banning it , Mr . Santorum is your guy .   Rick Perry   is an alternative for voters who are driven by their Christian faith , and don ’ t mind that he ’ s going to embarrass them by using their common religion in a comic-opera way . People who miss George W . Bush and want to make that mistake all over again could do a lot worse than Mr . Perry . That also goes for death penalty advocates . Mr . Perry is not reliably rightwing on immigration , but I can ’ t imagine that he would actually pursue his beliefs on the subject if he got into office . Kind of like Mr . Bush .   Jon Huntsman   is the obvious choice for more moderate Republicans who like a candidate who can articulate his positions , has experience in international affairs ( remember when Republicans actually cared about that ? ) , has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big .   Ron Paul   is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day NUMBER : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day NUMBER ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ?   Newt Gingrich   is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich .   Mitt Romney   . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

17321	I know not much about the topic , and really am not a philosopher in any kind of way but some very interesting concepts about freedom ( not directly related to security ) had been coined by [ Isaiah Berlin ] ( URL where you could have two way of seeing freedom : Positively ( in reply to the question : Up to what level are we free ? ) and negatively ( in reply to the question : What are the barrieres to my ultimate freedom ? ) . Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right ( negative freedom ) or far-left ( positive freedom ) social politics . But since , neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject , it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents , objectives and constraints . Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them . This also begets that security and liberty are not a zero-sum equation .	NOT

17967	"Well , here's the rub : it's not really sensible to talk about the mass of an individual  bound  nucleon ; the mass you refer to ( where a proton weighs a little less than a neutron ) is for a  free  neutron or proton . When nucleons come together to form a nucleus , the process gives off energy - - and the system loses a corresponding amount of mass ( E = mc ^ NUMBER ) . So if you think about the "" mass "" of a proton in a carbon-NUMBER nucleus , it is smaller than for a hydrogen-NUMBER nucleus ( i . e . a free proton ) . This is what is referred to as the "" mass defect "" and , when you convert it to energy , indicates the "" binding energy "" for the nucleus ( which is the energy it would take to blast the nucleus apart into its component free nucleons ) . So what you should think about is that when you have a beta decay , the creation of the emitted particle consumes a fraction of the energy released by moving a nucleon ( and thus the nucleus ) to a lower energy state . The rest of that energy is usually carried off as kinetic energy ( of the beta particle / neutrino / nucleus / Auger electron ) and / or a gamma ray . In fact , this interchange of mass and energy is what enables us to predict whether a nuclear decay will occur ! If the decay decreases the total mass ( of the nucleus plus any particles it emits ) , we know that it also releases energy and thus is moving "" downhill "" towards a more stable system with a higher binding energy ."

Then you get in to space and aliens and other dimensions and shit with the silver surfer , thor , dr strange and those high level guys that deal with universe ending villians like galactus and entire alien races and shit . The home town hero guys seemed to be a bit easier to follow since they were the main focus , the outer space guys seemed to have a lot more crossover appearances so you had bigger story arcs , but you needed to keep up with more comics . Edited to add the team comics where you had a few groups of heroes that worked together like xmen and avengers and fantastic NUMBER , but you had to keep up with their individual story arcs too so that gets expensive .

I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was NUMBER ( I'm NUMBER now , going to be NUMBER on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in NUMBER ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top NUMBER % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around NUMBER-NUMBER hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took NUMBER-NUMBER hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

18407	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

18746	  Statement by the President on H . R . NUMBER :   Today I have signed into law H . R . NUMBER , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year NUMBER . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over NUMBER pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section NUMBER affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the NUMBER Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law NUMBER-NUMBER ; NUMBER U . S . C . NUMBER note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the NUMBER AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section NUMBER confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section NUMBER ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section NUMBER ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the NUMBER AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section NUMBER in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section NUMBER seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section NUMBER is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section NUMBER provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section NUMBER provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section NUMBER in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past NUMBER years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

Most guns generally have much more range than they did in BC2 . There are also various attachments that effect range . Hit registration is much improved than BC2 ' s . BF3 doesn't suffer BC2 ' s sniper hitboxes . What you are most likely complaining about is the lag compensation . There are many ways to handle lag , but generally the best way is to prioritize the shooter's perspective . At least , to my knowledge . > The old maps could have supported NUMBER players if they added more spawn points all of these features were possible before they just restricted them . Oh god no , that would of been terrible for the console port that BC2 was . Bad company's mechanics were made for NUMBER in mind . Even NUMBER players was pushing it . Heavy Metal is probably the only map that could fit that bill anyway . > Your argument for why it is different is that they released the game they promised NUMBER years ago and labeled everything that should have been in the last game as a new feature They never promised NUMBER players , jets , etc . they promised a sequel to Bad Company . Which is more or less consilized Battlefield to compete with CoD's audience . Even more so with BC2 . Eventually we got a successor to BF2 , which features many concepts from both BF2 and BC2 .

19015	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the NUMBER NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

The teacher's reason ? I could have stolen the answers from somebody . "" Fair enough , "" I said . Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra NUMBER is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every NUMBER + NUMBER as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it . So I failed Algebra NUMBER while passing the state algebra test and getting 99th percentile in those stupid state tests . Now I'm in college taking Calculus NUMBER , and still not showing work for algebra problems . Sure I'll show some work if the problem gets crazy , but you'll never see me showing work for a simple solve for x or crap . kp1197 has it , if it's easy nobody writes it out .

A Skinner box is a piece of equipment which allows us to control the variables and contingencies that act upon organism in the world . In other words , a Skinner box is a representation of the real world . There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn . To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" . To put it more simply : everything is a Skinner box in this sense , as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning . The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule . And again , practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered .   tl ;d r :   Yes , games are like Skinner boxes .

Not everyone believes the bible literally . I do . I don't see any other way . To read it and take bits and pieces of it that satisfy you or fit your world view is to destroy the whole thing I think , or turn it into nothing more than a book of philosophy . I cannot do that . Many can , I cannot - it would be illogical . Now , because I came to conclude that our understanding of evolution is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the biblical account of creation , I've dived deeper and have discovered science that better fits my world view .

19895	> how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John NUMBER : NUMBER , NUMBER and Acts NUMBER : NUMBER says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . > So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER , NUMBER says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev NUMBER : NUMBER , NUMBER says death will be done away with , Isiah NUMBER : NUMBER confirms death will be swallowed up . > This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . > so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

It's got more of a genuine outbreak survival feel . Go find food . Find water . Find a bigger safe house , because we have NUMBER survivors in a tiny hotel room and tensions are running high . Shit like that . The game isn't perfect . Guns so far have been rare , but they kind of handle like shit . Melee weapons are incredibly flimsy , even things that should last forever like lead pipes and crowbars . However , they're lying around EVERYWHERE , so even if your weapon breaks you can just pick one up lying at your feet . Also , while I like the idea of leveling and gaining new skills from experience , I find it odd that the zombies level with you . How ? How are zombies gaining in experience ? They're dead .

21078	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

21370	I remember always liking Jimi Hendrix , and alwasy hearing he was the best , a super psychadelic monster that was invincible , and I believed it to some degree , but I guess I had just never totally understood the utter reverence that so many people had for him . One day , I met up with some friends at the beach who were all tripping , and one of them casually asks if I want to as well . It was a beautiful sunny day on the San Juans in Washinon , on a rocky coast with seals dipping in and out , and starfish everywhere . I decided to do it . Well , after spending some time with them , the sun started to go down , and they all began to head on , but I realized my trip was just beginning . I made my way home alone , decided to play some music as the trip took hold and thus began my moment with Jimi . I made my way slowly into my friend's room , which was still somewhat dark . I could hear things crawling and creaking on my peripherals , my vision swam with color and things gently breathed all around me . I sat down the couch and saw my roomie's guitar hooked up to the amp . I grabbed it , and in so doing touched his computer which had been left on . Immediately , a Jimi Hendrix playlist that he had been jamming along with began to play , the guitar already set in tune , with perfect crunch . I looked up , and lo and behold the moonlight had begun streaming through a window covered by a cloth wall hanging of Jimi hendrix himself . His lines , his rhythms , his playing suddenly all made totaly sense to me . He weaves this incredible psychadelic pattern that is amazing colorful and delicate . You can hear two or even three gutair parts weaving in and out of his playing effortlessly while he plays . It drives itself directly to your core , and explodes with joy and light . I don't know how long I was there playing with Jimi , but I'll never forget it , it really opened my eyes to what Psychadelic music really was , and the power music can have over a person who has a gift like that . Luckily , there are MANY wonderful musicians with that gift .	NOT

21581	"^ Excellent intro to philosophy . Also If you want to go chronologically , For Western Philosophy : look into the pre socratics then Aristotle and Plato Augustine Berkely , Locke , Hume Hobbes Heidegger Kant Hegel Nietsche - - read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus ' The Orestia , Sophocles ' Oedipus Cycle , and Euripides the Bacchae . Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was NUMBER at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of NUMBER and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ NUMBER , NUMBER poorer ) I was enrolled in a NUMBER week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at NUMBER , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are NUMBER-NUMBER years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street NUMBER . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for NUMBER years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

Bill Maher and Penn Jillette are entertainers , so I'm sure more people have heard of them , but they don't really think of atheism first when they think of them . Bill Maher is a comedian . Penn Jillette is an illusionist . People hate and distrust atheists because many times , they feel that their religious background gives them some kind of monopoly on ethics and morality . They think atheists can't care about something bigger than themselves ( which is wrong , we can , it just happens not to be a god ) , and therefore don't have any reason to have moral or ethical concerns . Thus , they must be worthless and should not be trusted .	NOT

Sooo , yeah . I'm not going to argue a straw man . And I'll agree that for a young trans woman the make restrictions of femininity can feel like oppression . Because it is .

22774	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

22857	I have no evidence to support that hypothesis , so at this point I must conclude that no , I am not . To support my previous statement however , we are able to measure gravity with tremendous precision , and it varies depending on where you stand on Earth due to your physical proximity to core . Similarly , gravity is weaker on the moon than it is on Earth , and the moon's gravity also affects Earth's rotation . Meanwhile , there is also the other planets of the solar system and of course the Sun itself , not to mention the contents of the milky way galaxy . Even a planetoid's gravity is not constant , as it accrues or loses mass its gravity consequently alters . Therefore , I conclude that gravity itself is subjective and not immutable . Even that however does not demonstrate objective morality , as was the initial request .	NOT

23044	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take  any  short sequence from  any  film , and make a mash-up just like this using NUMBER different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last NUMBER years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in NUMBER.NUMBER : NUMBER , not what looks like something closer to  NUMBER.NUMBER : NUMBER ( which was more common in early movies ) . Meaning , even the footage from Raiders has been altered to more closely resemble the footage on the right .	NOT

So ability to pronounce words you weren't familiar with , as well as the ability to define them was counted in ) . Mathematics skills , object identification , reading comprehension , physical problem solving ( I was given a few puzzles ) , abstract 3D imaging ( I'm sure you guys have encountered a 3D image where you're told to turn it X degrees in X direction and offered a choice of pictures as to what it would look like ) , and several more subjects . However , while there is the testing of certain cognitive abilities , some of the stuff like mathematics and language skills are fairly relative to your previous knowledge . I'd also like to point out that each problem was given a score and you would receive a total score , then would have it divided by your age . I'm sure we can all assess that someone like Abe Lincoln wasn't exactly stupid . However , with an IQ test testing against knowledge to some degree , Abe Lincoln would surely be hurt in his scores .
