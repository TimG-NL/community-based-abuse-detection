705	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats .

1310	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are NUMBER % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

1778	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that   we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it  easier  to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' .   That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am  not  saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM   ! "" But the   specific persecution of religious institutions and individuals was carried out to advance state atheism .  "	NOT

It's an original song I wrote with my band . Probably our more varied tune in terms of tempo and volume and changes , so I thought it'd be a good song to try . I made a few mistakes , but we can probably ignore those . If you'd like to tell me what you guys think of the quality ( given what you know about how I recorded it ) I'd love any criticism or advice you'd like to give . Here it is : URL	NOT

1815	"Attraction is pretty simple and pretty binary : it either is or isn't . There's no such thing as the friend-zone . Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ? "" Because they've learned to be guarded with guys lest their friendliness be mistaken for attraction . Or maybe this girl is just really open . Or maybe she actually just genuinely likes you as a human being ! You're not her emotional boyfriend ;  she's  your emotional girlfriend . You cutting her off might hurt her , but she'll survive and she'll date and otherwise get over it . For you , it will definitely hurt because you have the most to lose . That's why she's your emotional girlfriend . You're stuck in an awkward point in your dating timeline . It's going to suck getting through this , but you need to focus on things you can control . The only thing you can control here is you . Focus on yourself and getting as healthy as possible . Invest everything you have into yourself . Go to the gym , read self-help books , meet new people , find a therapist , pick up that hobby you've been putting off , go travel , have fun with your friends , learn how to be at ease with yourself , but stretch yourself as much as you can . You'll learn more about yourself , you'll learn how much you're capable of , and you'll learn what you like and what you're good at and what sort of people you don't like . It's the knowledge of these things that gives us confidence to take bold steps in our relationships , and that confidence in turn radiates attractiveness to others . Focus on yourself . Invest everything you have into yourself . Good luck ."	NOT

Without doing any googling , what I remember about the mini-shuttle is that is was a testbed for the SR-NUMBER follow-on , sometimes known as the ' Aurora ' , and not intended as a production craft . I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR-NUMBER getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

2547	"One of my favorite books ever is Hans Urs von Balthasar's [  Love Alone Is Credible  ] ( URL The chapter entitled "" The Third Way of Love "" is a wonderful overview of a lot of the things I've been describing in this thread . Balthasar is one of the major theological figures of the 20th century .   Apophaticism    The great grandaddy of the apophatic dimension of Christian theology is unquestionably Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite . You can find his entire collected works in the [  Classics of Western Spirituality  series ] ( URL He's a complicated thinker and mystic , but his  Mystical Theology  is about NUMBER pages . Its the kind of thing that you would read and reread , digesting slowly and prayerfully .  One of the two most influential and important Christian theologians ever , Thomas Aquinas was heavily influenced by Pseudo-Dionysius . Aquinas insisted that our language about God was mostly  analogical  and not simply literal . A good treatment of Aquinas's whole theology is [  Knowing the Love of Christ  ] ( URL Pages NUMBER-NUMBER contain an excellent overview of Aquinas ' mystical-philosophical account of our knowledge of God .  The other most important theologian of the Christian tradition , Augustine , wrote a pretty awesome but pretty thick autobiography called [  The Confessions  ] ( URL One way of looking at  The Confessions  is as Augustine's wrestling with his history of being intimately known by the ultimately unknowable God . A frequent paraphrase of one of Augustine's quotes about God is , "" If you have understood it , it isn't God . ""  Perhaps the most accessible introduction to negative theology or apophaticism is in Elizabeth Johnson's book [  Quest for the Living God  ] ( URL There's also an [ interview with NPR ] ( URL where she talks about it . ( I hesitated to put this on here because the book has been the target of some controversy recently as the US Catholic Bishops have criticized it . If you are interested in that debate [ this website ] ( URL has a pretty good overview of the whole debate . )   Faith    A lot of the above books address faith , but Avery Dulles has written a pretty handy overview of how faith has been understood by different theologians throughout the tradition : [  The Assurance of Things Hoped For  ] ( URL It's not the kind of book I would sit down and read from front to back .

2550	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

2757	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level NUMBER you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level NUMBER blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level NUMBER max backstab provides about NUMBER-NUMBER extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier NUMBER towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

2785	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are NUMBER % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since NUMBER the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe NUMBER-NUMBER years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding NUMBER Razorverge Thicket and NUMBER more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

3160	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : NUMBER . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . NUMBER . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . NUMBER . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT

3505	> When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible .

If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children .

3540	"The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited . Ron Paul - Bill of rights URL  If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place .    Ron Paul lying about the Constitution   The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history ,   churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . ""   Ron Paul on sexual harassment   "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended ,   but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . ""   Ron Paul - We the people act   The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , ""  including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

3602	"No , but here is the script from that section . The script is here . FLASHBACK : NUMBER INT NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ is beautiful , just NUMBER , and quite pleased with herself because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her . RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention  The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , NUMBER , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , NUMBER , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value  Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , NUMBER , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , NUMBER , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

3808	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At NUMBER my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was NUMBER at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of NUMBER and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ NUMBER , NUMBER poorer ) I was enrolled in a NUMBER week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at NUMBER , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are NUMBER-NUMBER years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street NUMBER . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for NUMBER years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

3822	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight . The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities . Most players don't recognize when the game is tipped in their favor ( IE someone on the enemy team got caught and died ) and fail to make moves on towers and neutral monsters when the enemy team either cannot respond or would be at significant disadvantage in doing so . Bad players , when in the NUMBER-NUMBER advantage , will opt to continue farming , wander aimlessly looking for farm , or B + shop at substantial health . Here's some example logic in which a team has NUMBER-NUMBER advantage and should opt to take dragon / baron or push towers , in that order .  DISCLAIMER :  This is very general . The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron . The exceptions to this line of logic occur most often when your team has been feeding and enemies cannot be dealt with even 5v4 . - - - GUIDE - - - Hau NUMBER Taek Neutral Dagrons after 10mins ( or 20mins for Baron Dagron ) - - -    - IF -   The number of people dead on their team > number of people dead on your team   - THEN -   group & move immediately to a dagron .    - IF -   enemy doesn't respond by also immediately moving to a dagron   - THEN -   begin fighting dagron .    - IF -   enemy moves in during your dagron killings - AND - team is still in good health   - THEN -   engage enemy for an easy teamfight win and extended time in the advantage .   - OTHERWISE -   back out and let them try to take it .

"" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : NUMBER.NUMBER Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit   or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered .   While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts .

4726	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept -  know  that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

6188	> how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John NUMBER : NUMBER , NUMBER and Acts NUMBER : NUMBER says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . > So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER , NUMBER says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev NUMBER : NUMBER , NUMBER says death will be done away with , Isiah NUMBER : NUMBER confirms death will be swallowed up . > This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . > so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev NUMBER : NUMBER-NUMBER . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

6859	"> few facts , rather than quoting unnecessarily and extensively Granted from wikipedia , but the article is accurate , well-sourced and conservative . I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off NUMBER % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra NUMBER is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every NUMBER + NUMBER as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it .

You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

7726	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take  any  short sequence from  any  film , and make a mash-up just like this using NUMBER different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last NUMBER years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in NUMBER.NUMBER : NUMBER , not what looks like something closer to  NUMBER.NUMBER : NUMBER ( which was more common in early movies ) . Meaning , even the footage from Raiders has been altered to more closely resemble the footage on the right .	NOT

8541	I agree . It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging . However , I'd say that games like MMOs , such as WoW , lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers . Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

9111	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from NUMBER up to NUMBER + , your only option is to cast a higher  quantity  of spells rather than improving the  quality  of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

9518	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was NUMBER ( I'm NUMBER now , going to be NUMBER on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in NUMBER ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top NUMBER % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around NUMBER-NUMBER hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took NUMBER-NUMBER hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

9524	Saying a country has a small population as a reason why their policies won't work here is just being intellectually lazy .

That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the NUMBER NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

9955	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks .

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering URL Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at  you  , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we   are   slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

10098	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since NUMBER ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know ,  anywhere else on the map !  Seriously , if you just went NUMBER-NUMBER blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since NUMBER , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at [ this ] ( URL thread on Barhah.com . We would breach the barricades and get a few kills , but for a full week , the survivors would beat us back out and cade up again . You also talk about zombie victories as if they're a new thing . They're not . Hell , the only major survivor victories I can think of are Giddings and Caiger I and II . They shouldn't be particularly surprising in a freakin ' zombie apocalypse . You say that zombies are OP , but the only reason zombies have any success is coordination . I've never seen a survivor strike team that focuses on clearing out buildings and securing them , but the major hordes each have at least one strike team . You're also forgetting the single biggest part of the AP balance . Barricades are a NUMBER : NUMBER AP advantage for survivors . This makes it a lot easier to play as a lone survivor — you can easily get a building up to EHB or find someone else's safehouse within NUMBER AP . It's a lot harder for a lone feral zombie to open up a building or find one that's already open , and it's practically impossible to open up an EHB building alone , especially for a low-level . Urban Dead has historically had a survivor advantage , aside from when the megahordes ( Shacknews , LUE , and the Dead ) show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( URL greatest proportion of level NUMBER players are military , and NUMBER % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead .   That is not Urban Dead .   Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually  try to survive  . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

10860	[ This NYT article ] ( URL helped me a lot :   Michele Bachmann   is the obvious choice for a true Tea Party believer , who wants a candidate to carry the banner of far right contempt for and alienation from Washinon . Other candidates try on the Tea Party tri-corn , but it doesn ’ t fit . Ms . Bachmann is the real deal – and for that reason , I think she has no chance of winning .   Rick Santorum   is the candidate for a Republican who places a high premium on strongly conservative social positions sincerely held . Mr . Santorum doesn ’ t just talk about these issues , he ’ s voted on them repeatedly . He is inflexibly opposed to a woman ’ s right to make decisions about her reproductive life . He is clearly religious but doesn ’ t exploit it like like Gov . Rick Perry , who wears his Christianity on his sleeve and across his shirts , like a Nike swoosh . And if you really care about abortion , as in banning it , Mr . Santorum is your guy .   Rick Perry   is an alternative for voters who are driven by their Christian faith , and don ’ t mind that he ’ s going to embarrass them by using their common religion in a comic-opera way . People who miss George W . Bush and want to make that mistake all over again could do a lot worse than Mr . Perry . That also goes for death penalty advocates . Mr . Perry is not reliably rightwing on immigration , but I can ’ t imagine that he would actually pursue his beliefs on the subject if he got into office . Kind of like Mr . Bush .   Jon Huntsman   is the obvious choice for more moderate Republicans who like a candidate who can articulate his positions , has experience in international affairs ( remember when Republicans actually cared about that ? ) , has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big .   Ron Paul   is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day NUMBER : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day NUMBER ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ?   Newt Gingrich   is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich .   Mitt Romney   . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

11074	"> You do realize that animals eat plants , right ? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten ? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ?  We don't need to be eating plants  We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) > Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . > You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , NUMBER % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed .

The authorities granted by the AUMF , including the detention authority , are essential to our ability to protect the American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces , and have enabled us to confront the full range of threats this country faces from those organizations and individuals .   Because the authorities codified in this section already exist , the Administration does not believe codification is necessary   and poses some risk . After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention authority , Congress must be careful not to open a whole new series of NUMBER legal questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the country . While the current language minimizes many of those risks , future legislative action must ensure that the codification in statute of express military detention authority does not carry unintended consequences that could compromise our ability to protect the American people .

When I was about twelve , I went to the county fair and saw a booth where they had rabbits for sale , including this huge specimen for $ NUMBER , probably a Flemish Giant or Chinchilla , in retrospect , though specific details of appearance escape me . Anyway , I positively begged my mother to let me buy it with my accumulated allowance , but she refused ... wisely comprehending that I was more eager to possess the rabbit than to care for it . Glad to hear that you keep multiple rabbits ; given the social nature of most varieties ( and their relatively short history of domestication as house pets ) they are certainly far happier for the company than they would be alone .
