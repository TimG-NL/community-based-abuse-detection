146	fatpeoplehate	For the record , I've upvoted you because you're adding to the discussion . Fried things aren't inherently bad . It causes some very wonderful chemical reactions to occur that allow for extremely complex and rich savory flavors . Also , for some of us , we actually need a little more fat in our diets . The meal plan that I worked out for this week somehow ended up at only 39g of fat a day , when I was shooting for <NUMBER> - 72g . I purposefully fried part of the meal in order to add lipids to my diet ( and don't worry , I accounted for everything calorically already ) , so it was actually beneficial and healthy ( amusingly enough ) to have fried part of my meals . All of that said , I'm actually a little concerned is all . Not eating foods because you don't want to or because you don't like their taste or because you think they're not worth the caloric payment is totally fine . But the way your post reads makes it seem like fried foods make you anxious , which is why you stay away from them . And that's not healthy . I'm only saying this because I don't want anyone large or small to have an unhealthy relationship with foods . It's okay to hate a food with a passion . It's okay to like a food but never eat it . But you should never feel scared , anxious , or overly-conscious about a food . Think of it this way . A large egg hard-boiled is about <NUMBER> calories . A large fried egg is about <NUMBER> calories . That still means that I could eat <NUMBER> fried eggs in a day . They're not horrible for you . Yes , their calorie count per egg is a little higher , but if you look at it as just another number , you might be able to see it more logically as a trade-off on different flavors vs . a little more calorically . And if you don't want to have fried eggs or if you don't like their taste or texture , that's perfectly fine . But they're nothing to be scared of . They're not going to make you fat . The power to make you fat or skinny is still <NUMBER> % your power , and no food can change that . PS , I'm very sorry if I read into your post wrong . Feel free to correct me if I did pick up the wrong message . I always , always care more about knowing what's right than I do my feelings , and I won't feel upset or embarrassed to be told I'm wrong if I'm told what's right .	EXP

206	milliondollarextreme	Woah that looks fun , let me try : Great and manifold were the blessings , most dread Sovereign , which Almighty God , the Father of all mercies , bestowed upon us the people of England , when first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and reign over us . For whereas it was the expectation of many , who wished not well unto our Sion , that , upon the setting of that bright Occindental Star , Queen Elizabeth , of most happy memory , some thick and palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land , that men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk , and that it should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State ; the appearance of Your Majesty , as of the Sun in his strenh , instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists , and gave unto all that were well affected exceeding cause of comfort ; especially when we beheld the Government established in Your Highness , and Your hopeful Seed , by an undoubted Title ; and this also accompanied with peace and tranquillity at home and abroad . But among all of our joys , there was no one that more filled our hearts than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word among us , which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the riches of the earth ; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself , not only to the time spent in this transitory world , but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven . Then not to suffer this fall to the ground , but rather to take it up , and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your Highness did leave it ; nay , to go forward with the confidence and resolution of a man , in maintaining the truth of Christ , and propagating it far and near is that which hath so bound and firmly knit the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You , that Your very name is precious among them : their eye doth behold You with comfort , and they bless You in their hearts , as that sanctified Person , who , under God , is the immediate author of their true happiness . And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay , but every day increaseth and taketh strenh , when they observe that the zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go backward , but is more and more kindled , manifesting itself abroad in the farthest parts of Christendom , by writing in defence of the truth , ( which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be healed , ) and every day at home , by religious and learned discourse , by frequenting the house of God , by hearing the Word preached , by cherishing the teachers thereof , by caring for the Church , as a most tender and loving nursing father . There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and religious affection in Your Majesty ; but none is more forcible to declare it to others than the vehement and perpetuated desire of accomplishing and publishing of this work , which now , with all humility , we present unto Your Majesty . For when Your Highness had once , out of deep judgement , apprehended how convenient it was , that , out of the Original sacred Tongues , together with comparing of the labours , both in our own and other foreign languages , of many worthy men who went before us , there should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the English tongue ; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite those to whom it was commended , that the Work might be hastened , and that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner , as a matter of such importance might justly require . And now at last , by the mercy of God , and the continuance of our labours , it being brought unto such a conclusion , as that we have great hopes that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby , we hold it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty , not only as to our King and Sovereign , but as to the principal mover and author of the Work ; humbly craving of your most Sacred Majesty , that , since things of this quality have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented persons , it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as Your Highness is ; whose allowance and acceptance of our labours shall more honour and encourage us , than all the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us . So that if , on the one side , we shall be traduced by Popish persons at home or abroad , who therefore will malign us , because we are poor instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto the people , whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness ; or if , on the other side , we shall be maligned by self-conceited brethren , who run their own ways , and give liking unto nothing but what is framed by themselves , and hammered on their anvil , we may rest secure , supported within by the truth and innocency of a good conscience , having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity , as before the Lord , and sustained without by the powerful protection of Your Majesty's grace and favour , which will ever give countenance to honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and uncharitable imputations . The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy days , that , as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many singular and extraordinary graces , so You may be the wonder of the world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity , to the honour of that great God , and the good of his Church , through Jesus Christ our Lord and only Saviour .

Paris , where possession of any firearm is illegal , has suffered not just one , but two separate terrorist shootings in the previous year . These two massacres , one with over double the deaths than this tragedy in Orlando , prove conclusively a need for citizens otherwise hapless to have means to defend themselves . Clearly , as we see in all of these shootings , the police do not respond quick enough to the scene to eliminate the threat . Fighting "" gun violence "" in the United States not only moves us closer into the realm of a police state , where citizens are barred from the ownership of guns , monitored on the Internet and on their phones and all other communications , but it also ignores the true motive behind this attack - radical Islamic terror .

They dye their hair funny colours , get extreme and aggressively out of the norm hair styles , lots of piercings and tattoos . I bet it starts like "" i need attention , I'll dye my hair , oh and I've gained some weight but a new age haircut will make people less on that . Oh and well all my friends have nose rings and piercings so i should do that . I'm also vegan and gluten free now . Meat is murder . Occupy Wall Street Black lives matter , and White people are literal hooman filth because I'm feeling guilty about what my ancestors did even though I'm so far removed from them that i would be OK with blacks enslaving me for a while as compensation . Oh look a new trend of being transgendered is cool so I'm transgendered i suppose and how dare you insult my rights . Being "" fat "" is just as healthy as being skinny stop fat shaming and mansplaining you cis scum . Dude most of those people looked attractive and very normal at first . It's incredible how low self esteem / need for validation will take you to such extremes . This is how you get SJW's , neo nazis , hell , even drug addicts . You're not born with a needle in your hand or a pink undercut . You surround yourself with these people and after enough time the constantly being around it normalizes it all and you join slowly but surely . With enough pressure and enough time just about anyone will become any one of these labels that are floating out there . It's a self feeding cycle . Who can be more extreme than then precessor . We see it often with religion as well . For example in Judaism you can't have milk and meat when the Bible says no calf in its mother's milk because that's a shitty thing to do so be cool guys . Then someone was like , well that means any beef with any milk . Then someone is like no way its all meat with any dairy producing animal . Then someone is like yo even though chickens don't make milk you can't have chicken with milk because it's now meat and you can't have meat with milk . We went from don't be cruel to don't eat milk with meat all because every important Jewish figure along the way decided to be more extreme with their rules than the previous person . We see the same thing happening with feminism . At first it was a movement to give women an equal playing field . Now it turned into bringing down the white man . They actually hate on white ( usually middle or higher class ) people for the color of their skin ( but let's be real it's often about being male and / or wealthy ) which by definition is racism but turns out you cannot be racist against white people . Any person hating a type of people based on their skin or culture heritage is racism . If you hate Jim from the office because he's a cunt , that's a different story but you don't hate him because he's a white guy , that's racism . The point is though , feminism was a great concept at first . Get women treated better , equal pay and benefits , etc . Then it turned into , well men have ruled the world for two millennia so it's our turn and let's take some power , and then all of it and tell them everything is their fault while simultaneously doing things that are just as bad as what they did , or even doing things we are criticising white men of doing . Eventually feminism turned into a gender study somehow and merged with LGBT issues , normalizing it all which is great , if you're gay and born that way , whatever dude glad you can get married and that you're happy , we are all people together . But then it turned into a cool thing to be bisexual or transgendered and people are deciding that they are so deeply gay that they need to be the other sex . I absolutely think many people are actually trans , being very feminine boy or masculine girl since childhood or being born with unidentifiable gender , etc . But a large part of LGBT is that a regular joe shmoe ​ surrounds himself neo feminists and the LGBT crowd because they are nice and fun to be around at first and after enough time , he loses the rest of his friends and only has these type of friends and they say being LGBT is the only acceptable way to be a man anymore , otherwise you're guilty of what your ancestors did but if your LGBT your not part of the problem anymore you're the victim So you somehow swing the LGBT thing and grow to like it and it spirals out of control and soon enough you're on hormones . None of this is meant to say that lots or most LGBT people are not genuinely gay / trans / whatever , or that all feminists are bad , I'm just saying that's it's very easy to indoctrinate people when you successfully shove your mantra down their throats on the daily basis . That's how we got Nazi Germany , and that's how we got <NUMBER> USA ."	EXP

306	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality .

If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children .

Some are positive , and some negative , yes . but a ton of them are neutral and basically meaningless like being left handed or mentioned skin color .

It means your opinion is selective in its logic and you never bothered to apply the same logic to other things to test it .

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays .

796	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

1062	worldnews	I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally . If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) .

1421	holocaust	Bigger Issue This , of course , brings us to the bigger issue , which is , how do we know what really happened ? The answer to that question is historical research , but that is precisely what the delict “ holocaust denial ” has been created to prevent . Holocaust denial is another word for Jewish control of discourse , in particular historical discourse , in particular historical discourse about World War II . If a historian publishes something that a powerful Jew , which is to say a Jew with powerful backers , dislikes , that person will be punished . If the person in question lives by writing books , as David Irving once did , the Lipstadt brigade will get him blacklisted in the publishing industry . If the person in question is a professor , the big Jews will try to get him fired , as Deborah Lipstadt herself did in the case of Professor David O ’ Connell . In this instance , Lipstadt failed , but David O ’ Connell ’ s case is not typical in this regard . More typical is the case of Norman Finkelstein , who was fired from his job at DePaul University in Chicago . The fact that Finkelstein was a Jew himself doesn ’ t matter . It ’ s the big Jews , in this case Alan Dershowitz , who decide who is to live and who ’ s to die in academe and publishing . Finkelstein wrote a devastating critique of Dershowitz ’ s book The Case for Israel , and , as a result , Dershowitz set out to destroy Finkelstein ’ s career . It was , in many ways , a typically Jewish response , the academic version of “ You ’ ll never work in this town again . ” What followed was equally Jewish . In fact Finkelstein characterized the dispute as a contest over “ who was the toughest Jew from Borough Park . ” The definitive answer to that question is in : the big Jew from Borough Park is Alan Dershowitz , who got Finkelstein fired with the collaboration of the supine Catholic priest who is president of DePaul University . Among other things , this also shows that a selection process is at work among Jews in academe . Any Jew who goes against the interests of organized Jewry will get destroyed by the ruthless academic enforcer Jews who represent their interests . Most Jews are immune to struggles like this because they fall into the broad , gray middle category of fellow travelers , Jews who go along with the agenda in order to collect big salaries for a cushy job . But there are larger lessons to be learned here . First of all , when if comes to a choice between money and principle , Catholic universities go for the money . Secondly , the fact that academe has become the site of unseemly brawls like this is largely the result of Jewish influence in academe . As Professor Lipstadt made abundantly clear in her talk , the university not the place where the big Jews seek the truth . The university is a place where Jews settle scores . It ’ s where they punish people who threaten the Jewish hegemony over discourse . This should not surprise us . The university is not a Jewish creation . It is a Catholic creation of the Catholic Middle Ages , and so it should not come as a surprise that Jews have all of the difficulties which come with functioning in an alien environment when they are admitted to universities . For over <NUMBER> years , from roughly the beginning of the 13th to the middle of the 19th century , Catholics were involved in the creation and preservation of the university as a place where one engaged in the disinterested pursuit of the truth . This was also the place and period of time during which representational art reached its culmination as well . The link between these phenomena--art and the university as manifestations of the Logos which finds its embodiment in Christ and its cultural expression in Catholicism--is no coincidence . Conversely , the Jewish subversion of academe is similar to the Jewish subversion of the art world , something which occurred during the same period of time and , as Israel Shamir points out in a brilliant article “ A Study of Art , ” in his book , Caballa of Power , for the same reasons . If the culmination of Catholic culture was the creation of the university , the culmination of Jewish culture was capitalism , which , over the course of the latter half of the 20th century in America , gradually devoured the university , by restructuring it according to capitalist , which is to say , Jewish principles , in particular those articulated by Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys , a gang of thugs which rivals Professor Lipstadt in its brutality . The institution of tenure , which was a relic of the Middle Ages , was subverted and then replaced by a system in which Jewish superstar professors like Stanley Fish could earn six figure salaries ( While at UIC , Stanley Fish earned more per annum than the Governor of Illinois ) , while the majority of the teaching was done by wage slave adjuncts . . This is not my opinion ; it is the verdict of Heinrich Graetz , the father of Jewish historiography , who claimed in his magnum opus that the study of the Talmud led to the moral corruption of the Polish Jews : To twist a phrase out of its meaning , to use all the tricks of the clever advocate , to play upon words , and to condemn what they did not know . . . such were the characteristics of the Polish Jew . . . . Honesty and right-thinking he lost as completely as simplicity and truthfulness . He made himself master of all the gymnastics of the Schools and applied them to obtain advantage over any one more cunning than himself . He took delight in cheating and overreaching , which gave him a sort of joy of victory . But his own people he could not treat that way : they were as knowing as he . It was the non-Jew who , to his loss , felt the consequences of the Talmudically trained mind of the Polish Jew . <URL>	EXP

1427	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

Some will hit the gym while others will kill themselves . I like your idea OP , but I dislike stories that become too involved with politics .

He tried going to the club , and tried gay dating apps for three years , and it never worked for him . Gay "" dating "" apps like Grindr aren't for dating : they're for hooking up . And there's a hookup culture at gay clubs as well . Even with a good , warm personality , and good looks , you're most likely not going to be finding a nice , loving relationship in those venues . It ’ s more often about seeing who you can have sex with , having sex , then seeing who else you can have sex with : objectification . When this story first broke , I almost immediately thought “ internalized homophobia . ” But as this story unfolds , I see someone who can ’ t reconcile his strict upbringing , with actual gay dating , or gay hookup culture . Everyone seemed to be having fun at the gay club and meeting each other — except for him . Every time he went , hundreds of shirtless men were laughing , dancing , grinding , yet he sat in the corner due to poor socialization , and his inability to adapt , and drank . This massacre could be an instance of homophobia . It could be that he was angry that no one in the gay community liked him or wanted to date him because he couldn ’ t adapt to how to behave around , or converse with other gays effectively . He went to the club dozens of times , saw men objectifying each other , and perhaps became disillusioned and angry . Where was his love ? If he began to see the gay men as just objects , it would be easier to shoot them up . In his mind , if he ’ s a person , but no gay men ever liked him , they ’ re not people .

Yeah I agree that it isn't always ha ha funny like your usual entertainment-comedy-laugh-generating-show and MDE doesn't really use the same methods for generating laughter within you in the same way as other entertainment producers . As I see it mainstream comedy producers will have writers sitting in a room discussing and planning how they can design entertainment that will make the audience laugh with their fabricated joke-lines . They create what they think will make you laugh that is , and often just not being passionate in the creating but copying other entertainment producers methods so they can sell entertainment that is satisfying enough for the same type of audience . The difference between this type of comedy and MDE , I think , is that MDE creates what they themselves think is funny snd sometimes they will use like internal jokes that is not relatable to all , but the whole thing is more real in a sense and more relatable . I felt like a real human being when I watched World Peace and when I'm watching like Two and a Half Men ( or John Oliver etc . ) I'm feeling like a consumer or slave to a certain type of scheme or way of thinking . So yeah I think what MDE does is meaningful and generative in this sense that it is original and doesn't pander to any specific scheme or typical comedy methods designed for business and cheap laughs , and maybe this is related to why they chose the name "" World Peace "" because the content of the show , besides the fun and creative works , gives you a sense of not being a bitch or slave to a certain type of scheme or way of thinking . Maybe ur friend doesn't like MDE comedy becaused it doesn't tell him when to laugh which leaves him with a void and feeling of confusion but this is what some like with MDE too ."	EXP

2213	uncensorednews	I think this has more to do with the fact that race is identified by where you're born and the color of your skin , and it's not something that genetically can be confused . But as far as gender goes , with the presence of people like hermaphrodites there are obvious possibility for genetic mutation in the fetal development . Who's to say that a person born with the predisposition of being one gender , is born with the physical characteristics of the opposite . While races has no genetic predisposition beyond what your parents pass on to you . Adding also the fact that races is a man made categorization of humans while gender in inherent . So there are obvious distinction why one has very little to do with the other in comparison to self identity .	IMP

Then they get conned by some miracle cure diet , or new-fangled exercise machine and after yo-yo-ing a few times with half a dozen attempts at getting in shape , their weight keeps increasing year after year . This scam industry creates what's known as "" learned helplessness "" which you can educate yourself on here : <URL> Once your brain has been beaten down enough , you literally give up on trying anymore . It's a biological process . And that is what these greedy assholes selling miracle cures are doing to real people who do want to lose weight , they just think that they are broken and can't lose weight . Contrast to someone having a weight problem , going to their doctor and asking for help , and then having their insurance cover some kind of treatment plan that is based on science , having their friends and family support them getting healthy instead of acting like they're just intentionally trying to kill themselves , with treatment aimed to manage and cure the disease , instead of simply exploiting them emotionally to milk money out of them . I challenge you to really reconsider your viewpoint . I don't think these whiney ass tumblrites who call themselves "" feminists "" are helping anyone by pretending that having a penis is equivalent to being a rapist . However that doesn't mean that men and women having equality is something we shouldn't strive for as a society , when you have women in some countries not even being allowed to drive cars because of their gender , or parents drowning their newborn girls or giving them sex-changes because of just how much better men are treated by their cultures . My point being , you can't ignore the problems of the many because a few assholes are going around suing the airlines for having to pay for two seats ."	EXP

Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats .

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

I would really only specifically state the method to use when I taught two methods that could both be used to solve the problem . And in those cases , there was usually another question that asked to solve the same problem or a similar problem using the other method . Somewhat related , I remember giving my students a choice between exams with "" show your work "" problems and multiple choice questions . At first , they were very excited about multiple choice . But when I explained that the "" distractors "" would be answers arrived at when making common mistakes and that there was no partial credit , "" show your work "" exams became a bit more appealing ."

Capitalism in it's purest form would bend more towards competition , the free market destroys monopolies in a sense seeing as how no one company is perfect and there's always a better way to do things , a cheaper way to do things , and some investment group will find a person that gives them the edge over a competitor .

Einstein's Theory of Relativity is the one such theory for gravity .

2891	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got !

Feminism is one of those things that started out great - the "" we can do it "" era of equal representation in the workforce via equal contribution ... sadly it's regressed into almost the opposite of what it used to be - it doesn't encourage women to be strong , eloquent , or deserving of respect any more ; it encourages them to be loud , obnoxious , and DEMANDING of respect , which fuels only opposition , to the point that it's actively damaging the good accomplished by more traditional feminism . ( The same can be said about celebrating the death of a feminist - it'll only make non-feminists look like fucking scum , and reinforce the toxicity of that movement ) A key thing to understand here though , is that a lot of people don't see that disconnect - especially the ones who identify as feminists . They think they're still modern-day Rosie the Riveters fighting the good fight , and are blind to the damage they're causing . In other words , their heart is in the right place ; they just have woefully ineffective practices . Does this make them worthy of murder ?

[ They ] will focus heavily on migrant workers , the working class , food shaming and fat shaming , and the dangers of using feminism as justification for assimilation / colonization .

It's basically a rite of passage for Western men , just like eye-raping women on the street and clubbing baby seals ( which is actually okay , because veganism is classist ) / sarcasm EDIT TO ADD : In response to a question about what she thinks of the fact that women post pictures to their blogs that sexually objectify men , she says : by its very definition , women cannot objectify men on the basis of their gender Looking past the fact that parsing that sentence is impossible , it's fascinating to learn that the mere act of sexual objectification belongs to the realm of male privilege .

3169	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

During that period , I lived with my mom and she sacrificed everything on her own to make sure I had a decent place to live and eat while getting through school . During this time I treated my mom like shit , wasn't thankful for what I had and was generally disrespectful to her . It will dawn on you as you get older that your mom is only doing what she knows best . She's trying , and even though she may not be as smart as you wish she was , she still hasn't given up on you and loves you unconditionally . Open up to your mom , and talk with her without ever raising your voice . Use a tactical vocabulary and persuasion techniques to solidify a conversation and ease a tense situation . When she gives you a moment to reflect on yourself and your behavior , don't take offense and get upset . Odds are you actually are being a douche to your mother and you don't realize it . When I was your age I said some terrible shit to my mother that haunts me to this day . I can still see and feel the raw emotion emitting from my moms soul ; she couldn't believe her own son could treat her so bad . Now I'll admit moms are not easy to reason with , specially single moms who aren't up to par with intellecutal standards of a teenager . But before you go throwing words about your mom , Imagine her calling you one last time as she's impaled in her driver seat from a truck wreck to call and say she loves you . And for the rest of your life , the one person you've known the longest in your life will be gone forever .

3246	fatpeoplehate	"Used to swim ( and eat ) that much with <NUMBER> % body fat . It's not exaggerated . In terms of weight gain , a calorie is not strictly a calorie . When you're working out multiple times a day , your body is processing food as though it's needed for energy at any moment , because chances are it is . This is mediated largely by insulin with other hormones playing a role as well . Effectively , if you're working out enough hours per day ( and the spacing here matters . 3x3 hrs . is better than one <NUMBER> hr . block ) you can eat almost unlimited calories and few to none will be stored as fat because your muscles are in full-time "" oh-fuck-give-us-more-glucose "" mode ( it's often said that the liver is the main storage for glucose , which is true by concentration , but by total quantity muscles dominate ) . FWIW , this is also why ketogenic diets can be very effective in treating obesity . They normalize a completely fucked insulin response so that the body is less likely to store dietary calories as fat ( and more likely to burn fat-stored calories for energy . Double win ) . This is also why shitlords can get away with eating a lot of something unhealthy like cake or ice cream ON OCCASION . Ever notice that if you eat much more than you burn in a day , you still don't instantly gain weight ? Your body is keeping a lot of those calories around as fast-energy : protein and glycogen . The fatties don't get this advantage . They've already "" trained "" their bodies that the caloric excess isn't going away anytime soon , so the body needs a more long-term solution : fat .

So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ?

That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

I know that a lot of times in this sub , we may jump at the chance to paint anyone as an SJW , but I really think that Peterson is just making an observation about humanity as a whole , not specific races .

4067	fatpeoplehate	Nature won't stop obesity , only a global education intervention and food reform will . Natural selection is the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring . Natural selection is dead in modern humans due to the infrastructure and support systems we have in place . If you're sick we have doctors , surgeons , and medicine . If you're disabled or handicapped we have technology that allows one to live their lives closer to the norm . If you're poor you're provided free health care and food through welfare . We've extended the life expectancy of our species by making it damn hard for someone to die . Despite being unattractive , fat people will still always get fucked . You have the desperate , ugly , socially inept , and / or fat that simply can't do better . Fat people may want someone skinny and attractive but excluding finding a skinny chubby chaser , they will realize their place and eventually settle with someone who doesn't contrast their size and start a family . Obesity reduces life expectancy but not to the point where they won't reach an age where they can't produce offspring . Obese people tend to be poor and less educated . The poor and less educated tend to produce more offspring and have their children sooner in life . In that sense they are technically beating educated / skinny people on the natural selection front since they are living long enough to produce a greater quantity of offspring . Couple that with a lower life expectancy , the parents will die off at younger ages leaving their children with less education and resources to better their positions in life . Now their's stupid poor fat children that will grow up and repeat the cycle . HAES will eventually kill it self off and their supporters will turn on it the same way smokers did . The main figureheads might be healthy now , but in a few years / decades they will be in the ground . The ones that replace them will be in ground . The notion of HAES will be buried with them as they see their idols and role models dying at early ages . Those that were a part of the movement against movement will speak out in their dying years just like the Marlboro man realizing the error of their ways . This will only quell the uproar we're hearing from the loud fats currently , but it doesn't stop the problem . We haven't eradicated smoking , just lessened the impact , just stopped people from saying that it's not not healthy . There's millions of nonvocal fatties that aren't with the HAES movement but just can't be normal weight because they lack the willpower to be normal size or simply don't care . They sit in their car to get to work , they sit in their office at work , they sit in their car to get back home , and sit in their home watching tv all the while stuffing their face all day . They are addicts and food is their drug . Without proper education starting early in their lives and making unhealthy food more expensive harder to get , fatties will continue to be fat .

4101	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

"" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

4420	Seattle	My husband and I ride . I just started last month . He's been riding for years . He just got back from a great ride . Yes , it's wet . If you're not comfortable in that , don't ride . If you are , then you're golden . Yes there are hills . There are routes so that you can avoid the worst of the hills for either lights or rain . If all else fails , there's a great bus system in place . I'm still pretty much a fair weather rider , but I've been out a bunch of times since I got my endorsement last month . Even several times this week . I got rained on once , but I have waterproof gear , so I didn't care , other than being my first time in the rain . The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists . At least I haven't noticed a problem yet . But even when driving I like Seattle drivers . However , we moved from NC three years ago where you need to develop a sixth sense against the idiocy of driving there . So anywhere seems tame and normal after that for <NUMBER> years . People use turn signals here to indicate a turn . Other drivers see that and respect it . There are far fewer tailgaters here . The pace is generally much much slower , about the speed limit rather than <NUMBER> mph above it . The roads are noisier , though . There are quite a few Seattleites over on / r / motorcycles . So you can pose your question there and get a much more rider centric view on it . I haven't ridden anywhere else , but I like riding here . So much to see and do , fun roads and straight roads , highways and country roads . My husband likes to drive up to the mountains , turn around and come home .	NOT

4431	sjwhate	"I mean yeah sure but I don't think the problem here is that they shredded a printing of the Constitution . Rather than actually talking to these kids about why its "" triggering "" or "" oppressive "" and how they can deal with it ( or at least sending them to someone who can ) they just immediately start nodding their heads and blindly agreeing to anything to give the kids what they want . You can see both the younger Administrator suppressing a smile and laughter at the end at how ridiculous what she's doing is and the older lady ( smiling uncomfortably even more visibly ) puts up her hands like she wants to talk about something ( probably whether or not the "" student's "" concerns matter or not ) but instead she just silences herself and does whatever the student asks . That lack of communication and doing anything to appease these adults as if they're crying children is either what they're trained to do in their jobs or conditioned to do by the culture they feel is surrounding the sociopolitical ideals of the school and / or the country as a whole as the school feels it should relate to . In either case its at the very least negligence and at worst actively appeasing a mentally-ill person in lieu of suitable treatment . Is it up to the school administrators to shred the constitution with you ? I really don't think so . They should discuss why its triggering and if the student is unwilling to discuss that recommend them to a therapist who can because they might have bigger problems . Triggers should be managed and if these are some kind of special triggers that need the rest of the world to appease them then they should rename them rather than trying to define the already well-established terminology of what a psychological trigger is . Its not a school's job to coddle and appease its students more than their parents already have , its their job to challenge them intellectually and manage their concerns regarding schooling . If they have a personal problem , they need to referred to someone then confer with that person as to how the school can work with their issue . A Director of Equal Opportunity shouldn't be bending over backwards for something that's "" triggering "" because its a psychological problem , which is well outside her area of expertise . But the fact they immediately did without hesitation shows there's a sort of unbeatable power behind the word "" triggering "" or "" oppressing "" beyond its original context , at least to Colleges which , for the majority , are undoubtedly far left swinging . Those words don't need conversation , treatment , or analysis they simply mean the person who says them needs appeased rather then treated or questioned or else you are a "" problematic "" or "" oppressive "" person , whether the inspiration for the "" triggering "" or "" oppression "" is real or not . When your job and reputation is on the line you'll become a slave for those words and any explanation given to you , no matter how illogical , you will run with because the endgame is that you're not a problematic or oppressive person . The payoff really isn't that you're a good person , because you could still screw up by having the wrong opinion at any time . But more that you are NOT a problematic or oppressive person and thats enough that you can continue to stay on your toes without getting knocked down . TL ;D R These weren't the right administrators to handle something psychological like something "" triggering "" . The fact that they immediately complied with anything without working through the root of the cause of the "" trigger "" shows the word has unreal and unreasonable power because people don't want labels attached to them that could damage their reputation , earn them viral harassment , and cause them to lose their job . Its at the very least negligence and at worst its actively appeasing a mentally-ill person in lieu of suitable treatment ."	EXP

4574	sjwhate	"You're correct there probably is no point . I re-read your post and you started out saying that you want to be just like Milo so you can spread your own propaganda rather than "" investigating "" the truth like an actual journalist would do . He's the largest figure in modern day right-wingery only to children like you , he doesn't exist outside of reddit and r / The_Douchebag circle-jerk . That's not "" jouralism "" it's info-tainment , and at that point you're the one who's off topic because you're posting about being worried about getting a real job because you secretly want to be a conservative puppet which is the opposite of actual reporting . If you want to go beat off to the idea that all foreigners / muslims hate gay people , while simultaneously telling me that conservatives seriously support gays when your poster girl Kim Davis sits in jail because she won't even follow "" The Law "" , go ahead , but don't think you're fixing anything by joining the problem , or refusing to accept the fact that republicans have been the source of the problem that created a need for the people who flock to a bullshit feminist movement to right the wrongs they put in place over the last <NUMBER> years . The only reason Milo can exist today is because someone who'd you probably call an SJW in the <NUMBER> ' s or <NUMBER> ' s stood up for the rights of someone like him to be allowed to do whatever the fuck it is you think he does today . As if Ragen was calling AIDS a gay disease in <NUMBER> and then decided to bring them into his cabinet in <NUMBER> . It didn't work that way , and the fact that you don't have a problem with gays isn't due to some divine miracle , it's because a lot of people had to fight to put anti-discrimination laws in place to make sure it doesn't happen . You keep telling me that "" not all conservatives are religious , anti-science , blah blah blah "" , but then lump anyone who's for human rights as a SJW . If you don't want me to make your party out to be an anti-science , fundamentalist group of retards you should take your own advice and stop thinking that Liberals are the source of SJW bullshit . It's the same type of donors that fund the likes of Palin and Bachman that fund an Obama or a Hillery , but it's not the law that you're even pissed about . We're pissed because all this shit gets taken too far . There's a huge push back now to bring back free speech , but there's a difference fighting the problem and countering the bullshit with bigger bullshit . SJW's need to be called on their logical fallacies . As for why you'd ever consider taking an immigrant from one of those countries ; have you ever heard of Bill Maher ? He brings people on his show from those countries who want to get rid of those governments . You bring in people from those countries to save them from those countries . A gay person get's thrown off a build in Syria and you don't think that person wouldn't rather come here and live their life freely ? That they love the government that allows that to happen ? You're saying a <NUMBER> % of all the people that hit the ground from their <NUMBER> story drop thought , "" well this sucks but at least I'm not in America "" ? You bring them here so they become an advocate for your way of life and show the world it's possible to change it . That's why he brings them on his show , and that's how you make a change . Like the one that benefited fuck-face Milo's existence . Again , you're right , if you want to be a fanboy for the ones who have been destroying the world one piece at a time , such that they created the fucking SJW movement in the first place .. knock yourself out . I'd rather fix the problem . Good luck with your info-tainment career . BTW , I highly recommend you watch some George Carlin , or Bill Hicks , if for nothing else than to understand what the past was like - because just claiming that "" everything's fine now , gays and blacks aren't an issue "" because you weren't alive or paying attention to the thing's that happened before ... isn't a valid excuse to get your points across ."

You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No .

Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

4674	leagueoflegends	Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player , you can CS and teamfight . The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his / her games is because of missed opportunities .

Bad players , when in the <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> advantage , will opt to continue farming , wander aimlessly looking for farm , or B + shop at substantial health . Here's some example logic in which a team has <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> advantage and should opt to take dragon / baron or push towers , in that order . DISCLAIMER : This is very general . The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here ; but , this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron .

The overwhelming majority of the members of the rich jew families , the ones we all have heard of , all got safe haven from the Holocaust either on the other side of the Ocean , or even within Europe ; After the world learned about what had happened with the Jews in the Third Reich , there has been a strong , official and unofficial , ban on any attempt at criticizing the Jewish religion , the artificial "" Jewish people "" , the even more artificial "" Jewish state "" , the even still more artificial "" Hebrew Language "" , the jewish families and any individual with known or presumed jewish ancestry . The taboo surrounding the criticism of anything with the "" Jew "" label is almost on par with the social taboo on "" incest "" ; What's more surprising , however , is that such "" tabooing "" was able to single handely undo centuries , perhaps , thousands of years of criticisms , legitimate and illegitimate , on Judaism and on its followers , be they individuals , families or groups . As a consequence , history had to be rewritten to omit any negative mention on anyone who might "" belong "" to the "" Jewish people "" , biographers had to distort their own works to omit any criticism to the "" Jewish people "" made by the biographed person , and any direct criticism at any belief or tenet of Judaism had to be partially rewritten , so that the reader is led to believe that the criticism is aimed towards Christianity , Islam or "" religion in general "" ( example : criticism on circumcision of infant males aims the highlight on some Protestant branch of Christianity , instead of aiming the hightlight towards Judaism ); Likewise , any negative criticism about anyone or any family / group with a "" Jewish seal "" , from the past or the present , is branded as a "" conspiracy theory "" , and anyone who dares to open his / her mouth about them is branded as a "" conspiracy theorist "" and he / she is officially / unofficially punished by the estabilishment and by anyone who fears it ; In the crazy aftermath of WW2 , the artificial "" Jewish people "" was able to persuade all the emergent world powers ( USA , UK , and USSR ) to give to them the infamous "" Promised Land "" , which led to the creation of the artificial "" Jewish State "" of Israel , with its semi-artificial "" Hebrew Language "" , founded on the principles of religious homogenity and a semi-racial homogenity , and they all agreed with the idea of gradually kicking out the native population that occupied the land "" belonged "" to Israel that did not pass the "" Jewish "" filter , a process that has been happening since its foundations , and will happen until the whole of "" Palestine "" is absorbed into Israel and its non-jewish populations are kicked ."

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

5155	milliondollarextreme	Trump ’ s election is certainly not isolable to the wall promise , much like Hillary ’ s loss isn ’ t isolable to Wikileaks or American chauvinism . If anything can briefly be said about Trump ’ s victory it ’ s the end of the open secret of late hour liberalism - democracy ’ s total sham : the richest or best connected state-capitalists taking turns with the corpse of American national culture through vulgar populism . You should drop the idea that there is anything but brands and atomized identities in America . Addidas holds more people together than old values like imperial prestige or small-government agrarian libertarianism - if you disagree with this , youre just slow , or havent understood the events of the post-ww <NUMBER> social changes . Token desperate identification with these older values means exactly that they no longer exist or else theyd need no advocacy . Divorce lawyers and decreasing real wages are common objects but ideas about what America is about aren ’ t . If you think there is a common political culture , what holds the midwest to Michigan ? Or the rust belt to the South , or any of those regions to the west coast or the south west ? You say - a common reaction against attack . But with the decline of the old religious , chauvinist , filial order , and especially with the end of the illusion of the American dream ( except for those in main line WASP exurbs of cities ) , nobody has a unifying solution . Redpills want to go back , and blue to go forwards , each for their own sake as such with the inanity that comes with desiring something for its own sake . You are right that nations are poor for lack of interest from the market , but increasing globalization and cheapening labor have pushed the market into places it has never been before . The Middle East has seen billionaires born overnight from oil and it has destroyed their traditionalism - just look at Mecca today and the reactionary ISIS as a hyperaccelerated version of what has played out across the West . The wars and famines of Europe forced immigrants to the USA much in the same fashion , and with much the same shrieks about miscegenation . They will “ export ” bodies if the resources are too expensive to extract via war , a great parody of the slave days .	EXP

5207	politics	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : <URL> Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

One business , Provari and I think they were the only one that took the risk to make hardware in the USA , had to close due to FDA regulations and associated costs .

It will make domestic markets react and make the proper adjustments accordingly . Free trade and all that good stuff . Which is perfectly fine when others play by the same rules , but how the hell can you compete when your intellectual property is stolen , made for cheaper and maybe not the same quality , and start flooding the market complete with a similar logo / name on it ? Product that you spent money researching and having to deal with regulations that constrict small businesses .

Large corporations aren't that vulnerable but an owners small business is . Not to mention <NUMBER> % of the other stuff I mentioned , like Social Security , labor laws , unions , and infrastructure that past Republican leaders have pushed which are abhorrent to a very solid chunk of the Republican party now . Some things are just good bipartisan things to have and then sometimes a good thing gets abused and no longer works . Social Security looked good in order to take care of senior citizens , but there has been some doubt in the past whether it is sustainable . Not to mention that whole large scale screw up at Experian that resulted in SSN's being stolen and now people are wondering if it should be replaced . Not sure which labor laws your referring to . Unions have been disliked and liked from both political parties , depends on the union . Republicans won't like an infrastructure plan that results in the government being the main employer , it's reminiscent of socialism and communism . The entire original argument was about political parties switching . It hasn't . Consistent ? We got President Trump , a former democrat , in the White House as a Republican .	EXP

5308	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

Furthermore , there are millions and millions of disgusting hambeasts out there setting up dates with unsuspecting shitlords .

Fortunately I was too young then to comprehend their eventual fate , or I might have led a lapine insurrection . When I was about twelve , I went to the county fair and saw a booth where they had rabbits for sale , including this huge specimen for $ <NUMBER> , probably a Flemish Giant or Chinchilla , in retrospect , though specific details of appearance escape me . Anyway , I positively begged my mother to let me buy it with my accumulated allowance , but she refused ... wisely comprehending that I was more eager to possess the rabbit than to care for it .

It's just hard to throw such nonsense around when you see them for what they are , metal , wood , plastic , and not for what the anti-gun side wants you to believe they are . Gun control groups THRIVE on this ignorance . No gun control group will ever recommend education on the topic . - The one issue I take with the article is it makes too much of an issue between left and right . Democrat and Republican . Guns are not a partisan issue for the American people - they're a partisan issue for politicians . There are plenty of anti-gun Republicans who don't trust good inner city law abiding people with guns , and plenty of pro-gun Democrats that don't want to vote for Hillary because of her extreme gun control ( really , people control ) views .

5967	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

6009	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT

6108	uncensorednews	No , not really . Nigbama promised the American people that they would not be taxed if they didn't want to get insurance and he also promised that insurance rates would either stay the same or decrease , along with being able to keep your doctor . Anyone who had any in depth knowledge of the insurance industry knew how much of a failure Obamacare was going to be . When insurance providers can't turn down people who are prone to various illnesses due to living a horrible lifestyle , insurance premiums are going to skyrocket for people who actually take care of themselves . Also , the general premise of not being allowed to turn down people with preexisting conditions ( like morbid obesity ) is like allowing someone to total their car and apply for insurance right after .

I've spent 100s of hours watching videos and reading . Here is some of what I know happened on <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> : Rudimentary CGI ( overlay of a black outline of a plane ) aired "" live "" on national television with a <NUMBER> second delay . Over the next decade , fabricated and flight-path-contradictory "" amateur "" videos would be released almost exclusively by individuals in computer graphics and other computer related fields , purely for plausible deniability ( wow , this person faked that footage just to claim they got <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> footage ) . The buildings were packed with enough hydrocarbon explosions to give the impression of plane impacts / explosion . All this did was set them on fire .

Little to no debris was found , except for an intact passport of only the Arabic terrorist , and his unmolested "" Arabic bandana "" . The rest of the plane , and all of the bodies are said to have "" vaporized on impact "" by authorities including the FBI . For the Pentagon , one of the best explanations that I have come across , is that of Dmitri Khalezov , former Officer within the USSR's Nuclear Weapons Engineering Program : <URL> Dmitri Khalezov brings us to the method for the destruction of WTC <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> . I want to be clear , this was the designed , and planned upon , peacetime method for the eventual demolition of the skyscrapers . The engineers for WTC's decided that the most effective ( possibly the only way ) to demolish the towers when they became old was by nuclear means . This worked beautifully and as intended . The charges were probably around <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> meters underground . They caused a minor Earthquake ( recorded at Columbia ) , and all of the reports of "" trembling of the ground "" . They caused the <NUMBER> + mph winds going upwards which the "" <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> surfer "" road down . This is something you must understand about subterranean thermonuclear "" explosions "" . They're not really explosions as you would picture . They're the release of extraordinary amounts of heat .

Nevermind , who is utilizing these bombs , I want you to understand that journalists cannot publish to a wide audience , except for youtube ( and wikileaks ): <URL> You can see the effects of high energy free electrons ( beta radiation ) striking the camera in both the video of the nuclear device , and the following "" control "" : <URL> This effect is called scintillation .

6130	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

I assume you were raised in the West , so your notion of marriage is very different from a more conservative and traditional idea of marriage . You are looking for a life partner it sounds . In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts . The concept of ' right for me ' doesn't exist in that set up , it's more of ' right for both families ' .	NOT
6139	explainlikeimfive	, has governing experience ( as governor of Utah ) and knows his way around the executive branch . You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose , big . Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

6249	fatpeoplehate	"I'm not ignoring the squat booty , I did forget to mention that , though , because it obviously alters size . Thank you for saying that . However , we're not talking about weightlifting altering your waist size , we're talking about height . My argument , however , is not bullshit and I'm sorry if it offended you as such . I'm not basing it on bullshit either . I'm basing it on two things - - my careers . First of which was fashion modeling . A career , as I've said before elsewhere , literally built on the backs of tall women in sample sizes . And my current career , which I am working on a PhD in , is the study of bioarchaeology / osteology . Human skeletal remains . I know bones . Frame size does not vary all that much within one sex . Bodybuilding can build thicker bones , yes , but it's that huge muscle growth that's gripping the bone that's going to make a difference in your size . Your example has little to do with height . Your height does not change the density of your bones . This woman has a wide pelvic cage . Her iliums likely flare out much more than average . She is unusual . That can happen on a slender short woman , it is independent of height . My reasoning stands . The average woman , built with a normal frame , who doesn't lift heavy , tall or short , is getting fat at a US size <NUMBER> . Are there outliers ? Yes , there's always outliers . And if you're a <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> "" + woman , your entire body existence is an outlier . People my height are unusual enough . By that height , you're the size of a large male , and all clothing size bets are off for a woman . Frame width definitely adjusts at that large . But again , we're talking serious outliers here . When most people say tall women , they're usually talking about <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> ' . Edit : I just wanted to add for .. I don't know , interesting informational purposes . It's not that we can't and don't measure frame size . That's part of the process of every skeletal analysis I do . And anyone ( human sized ) can measure their wrists and get an idea of their basic frame type . But we're still taking minute differences . Just because you and the person next to you measure small and large frame sizes respectively doesn't directly mean you're going to be wearing hugely different clothing sizes . Bone thickness can tell us a lot of things , depending on how thick it is and where it's thick , about how a person lived . It's very useful in archaeological studies , generally for determining the most common activities someone did , and what sort of health issues may have plagued them ."	EXP

6463	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

But since Jesus was a Pharisee , he learned this from the Jewish Pharisee Hillel ( who was born <NUMBER> years before Jesus ): That which is hateful to you , do not do to your fellow . That is the whole Torah ; the rest is the explanation ; go and learn it . He even does the shema , which Jews are asked to do when they wake up and before going to bed . Literally everything he does is Judaism , with the exception of suggesting he is God . <NUMBER> . In fact , in the gospels they try to write in all of the things that a Messiah would need to be under Judaism ( riding in to Jerusalem on a donkey , etc . ) But it's based on the Jewish Messiah . Never mind that the Jewish Messiah was supposed to usher in world peace when he arrived ; that didn't happen so to Jews he is not the Messiah . Additionally , to be the Messiah a Jew had to be born from the Jewish line of David that passed through the father . In Mark , the first written of the Gospels there is no mention of his lineage or birth . So then in later Gospels they add in that both his Jewish mother and father had ties back to the Jewish king David to satisfy the requirements for Jesus to be the Messiah . Of course , you're aware that his father did not actually provide the seed , so this he did not obtain the lineage from his father as is required under Jewish law . <NUMBER> . I have read the bible and the gospels . Jews debate because that is how they are taught . Why do you think you rest starting Friday night ? That's because of the Shabbat that came from the Jews and it starts at the end of Friday . One of the many examples where Jesus seems to "" fight "" with the Jews is when one of his followers picks wheat from the field . According to Judaism they aren't allowed to because it's considered work and you are expected to rest on Shabbat . Breaking Shabbat was worthy of the death penalty so this was serious . Many see it as "" fighting "" but if I knew you were doing something serious under the law I'd rather I'd give you a heads up to let you know that you're potentially violating the law so that you have a chance to stop it . Jesus then argues the Jewish law because he is Jewish and knows the law to say that there is an exception to this work on Shabbat and that picking the grain was okay . Notice that Jesus himself doesn't break the Shabbat , it's one of his followers that he is teaching Judaism . <NUMBER> . You're implying that he taught crucifixion ? The Jews didn't crucify Jesus . It was the Romans and that's how they would kill people to send a message . <NUMBER> . If you are a practicing Christian , you realize that everything Jesus taught is based on the Jewish Torah . If I ask you how the world was created and you believe in Christianity , it's with Adam and Eve . So from a religious standpoint , the argument that there are different distinct races doesn't work since we all came from Adam and Eve . Again this is the book that Jesus learned and taught . <NUMBER> . Feel free to send me a link to a geneticist that shows that Germans are distinct from all the other races and that they evolved into humans separately from other races . If you have the scientific data to back that up I'd love to see it ."	EXP

Hitler embraced German nationalism so as not to “ compete with Marxism on its own ground ” , but explicitly acknowledged that “ ‘ the whole of national socialism ’ was based on Marx ” .

6777	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) .

6909	europeannationalism	"Thanks for sharing . I don't have the time to address everything you wrote so I've selected a few paragraphs that stood out to me . Here's what I think IS real : European history and culture is rich , varied , powerful , beautiful , sadistic , noble , messy , free-thinking , oppressive , liberating . It's all of the above . Whiteness intersects and intertwines with that cultural timeline , meaning different things to different people in different eras , and though I'm sure we could argue that forever , that's not really what you're interested in . Your idea of "" whiteness "" is the one seen through the lens of modernity , standing in contrast to Africans , West Asians , East Asians , Middle-Easterners , Pacific Islanders , etc . , sometimes including Hispanics , sometimes not , sometimes including Jews , sometimes not . But even with that messy definition , I believe there is still enough of a cultural identity that can be discussed . and traitorous strategies are heavily disadvantaged when compared to both ethnocentrism and humanitarianism . Neither race nor cultural separation are required for groups of humans to attack one another , and the more you seek to separate yourselves , the more likely it is your children will inherit those divisions and fight among themselves . Even if you limit European history to just the "" white "" portions , there was plenty of suffering . Racial purity scapegoats the underlying psychological flaws we ALL share as a species , and even if Hitler had his way and the world was repopulated solely by beautiful white babies ... do you really think that will prevent conflict and in-fighting even a hundred years later ? Humans will gladly invent differences out of thin air to justify otherization and violence . Of course we can never completely eliminate violence and suffering . Surely we should at least attempt to minimise conflict , though ; I see no better way of doing that than separating the races into homogeneous groups , letting in-group preferences play out in a semi-productive way and reaping the benefits of a relatively high trust society where everyone is "" like me "" with a shared purpose and goals . Forcing lots of racial groups together is a recipe for disaster because it results in low trust societies with constant tension and jockeying for power ( i . e . social dysfunction ) above and beyond the individualistic conflict that exists in homogeneous racial groups . If you're interested , you can also have a quick look at some of the links in the sidebar listed under "" Diversity and ethnocentrism facts "" to get a better idea of what I'm talking about ."	EXP

7104	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

And not N.Florida no . It was Homestead . What my mom calls ' the little Cuba south of Miami ' xD yes , it is hard on relationships and friendships . I am basically a social retard . I have had one best friend my whole life , and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner . Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon . I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people . Either way , i don't have anything keeping me here . Thank the gods for Reddit . Where's your mom from ? While i agree that some things are ... i dunno what the word is ... more abundant here , i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer . And frankly , i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living . Not retail at least . If i had my own farm , okay , i could see it . But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit . I might can fool myself sometimes like today , but it was because i actually did something at work and not because i handled customers . ( re-organized some shit that needed it badly ) I dunno .

7177	fatpeoplehate	"I work with kids , and some of the problems I see as a teacher's aide ( USA state funded before and after school care ) are that kids aren't getting educated in how much they should eat , and of what things . Hell when I was in school it it wasn't even taught how much you should eat of what , yes the food pyramid was gone over , but nothing about Cals in Cals out what is an actual healthy meal . Granted I am in my <NUMBER> ' s so fat when I was in school was the kid who was like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> pounds over weight not <NUMBER> . I don't think we'll see programs like this in the US , not because of feelings , well in some communities it could be because of feelings . I'm looking at you home town ... ( some place in Nor Cal ) But also because of the way schools are funded in the USA , if you look at what programs tend to get cut first during a budget crisis , it's always arts , fitness , and recess . Instead of having a few less admin or secretaries ... But if you look at how much time kids actually get outside and get running at the elementary school level it's really sad , it ends up being less then 25mins total for a <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hour day . The rest of the time they are behind their desks , and forced to focus , not only does this create problems in terms of them actually learning and being able to focus , it also leads to a lot of the childhood weight problems we are seeing . Some studies and teachers also point to this as a rise in the amount of ADD they are seeing . Now while I believe that ADD is real , as someone who works with kids , I can also see how over diagnosed it is . Because of the lack of physical activity the kids get now , also the kind of activity they can get . A lot of schools have banned games like kick ball , or tag , because kids could fall and get hurt . So they end up being expected to even play quietly when out side . Now if you live in a high income area , you don't have much to worry about , because in the US schools are funded by property tax . So a kid in the school district for the upper Haight probably isn't going to have to worry about PE or Sports being cut , in the way that kid in the district covered by the Tenderloin is . A lot of things are going into Childhood obesity and it's something that makes me fucking sad , at the k - <NUMBER> level because at that age range you don't have much control over your life and what you eat , and if you aren't getting the education on how to fuel your body and take care of it , then how are you going to know later on ? I have no sympathy for adult fatties , because they can talk to their doctors , they can use the google and things like MFP , and know how to learn things . I really think it comes down to schools giving kids enough activities and education on their bodies to end this problem , but it's not just a matter of hurting peoples feelings it's a matter of having the money to provide that education . Most teachers end up spending about <NUMBER> dollars a year of their own money to keep their class rooms going . The way we teach kids about food needs to change , and there also needs to be a change in the attitude held by parents where they just scream "" THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY DARLING I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU . "" That so many parents have today . Parents can decide not to vaccinate , parents can say no I don't want you to hold my baby back a grade even if they can't read , parents can decide if they want there kid to be fat ... this is the attitude that needs to change ."

7222	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America .

In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

7225	uncensorednews	I most certainly foresee a time in the future when East Europe splits of from the majority muslim west Europe and a possible WW3 scenario I just feel that would be very unlikely , my wife is born in France and lived there for <NUMBER> decades , and explained there is mostly North Africans population from mostly Tunisa , Algeria , and Morocco and they are poor and live in ghettos selling drugs , doing hood rat things etc . Instead of Muslim extremism Id be more worried about rampid consumerism , like how black Friday is becoming a thing . I can only speak for southern France though . I'm personally more afraid of Western Europe losing there wonderful worker rights and universal insurance from the unskilled workers coming in driving down wages which I haven't heard much of because most of them don't work anyways.But I feel that's more likely then thinking shariah law will be enforced . And I feel terrorist attacks are going to continually happen no matter what . It will take a while for the Muslim numbers to climb due to outbreeding and the slow cultural jihad that is taught in the Mosques to have minimum <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> children and to make sure to enter into positions of local government . I spent <NUMBER> minutes looking at wiki for your <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> children , I think that's what you heard or an overexaggeration unless you're confusing your Muslims with Mormons , are they on mountain bikes spreading the word of Allah ? My friend is kurdish and has <NUMBER> kids and my wife has Muslim faith friends who only have between <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> children . I don't know about anything else there , I see no fact checking One day it will be pure hell between the <NUMBER> sides , but I am sure that the rest of the World and its powers will side with East Europe and Russia Y'all are going to be just as divided as East Asia if you dont work out your fucking problems and nip it in the bud , I feel once that Merkel's ugly ass is kicked out , you'll progress a little more .

Yoko visited Paul and asked him to talk to John about coming back when her own personal relationship on the side was over . Yoko obsessively called John almost on a daily basis , according to both John and May Pang during their separation . So John didn't come crawling back by any means .

7403	uncensorednews	You're doing a lot of side-stepping to avoid the very simply observation I made ( which I did without either condemning or condoning ) which is that the EU seems to violate the sovereignty of the nations which are in it . Yes , everyone who is in the EU agreed to be in the EU , and yes , the EU can make exceptions to its directives , and yes , the countries can violate the directives ( though fining those countries is absolutely a punishment ; a punishment that is meant to be a deterrent is still a punishment after all ) . The fact is they're still being told to do things by other countries which is ipso facto an infringement of sovereignty whether it's a good idea or not . If you have to e . g . restrict gun ownership or be punished by other countries then they are not respecting your sovereignty regardless of their motivation , the severity of punishment , moral justification , chance of appeal , etc . In fact , I will go even further than that and say that to be allowed to violate a directive is still a violation of sovereignty , because it is them granting you permission to do something and thus still being under their control , rather than you simply deciding to do something and them respecting your freedom to do it . You cannot give permission to someone you don't have authority over .	IMP

V . or media in any way denouncing violence Not true , you just made up shit to appease your own view of the world . You have people anywhere from Ben Carson to President Obama talk about issues in black communities , BLM all the time . [ not ] doing anything to really strenhen race relations in this country So what do you want them to do ? Let's see where the rest of your rant goes Kids like the black students screaming at their professor at Yale or these idiots at a Milo event or these wonderful Dartmouth kids or the countless other examples of this deplorable behavior , are the reason shit like this is going down in America today . Nice strawmanning . I could pull videos out of my ass of whites , conservatives , old people doing something stupid or nefarious .. will that advance my argument ? No . Learn to think . Race relations are degenerating and quickly , and the black community is more pissed off than they were in the 80s when there was such violence and such despair during the drug trade . I don't know if that about the 80s is true , but I agree things have gotten worse . But then these middle class blacks started going to University , being told by not only their black professors , but their white professors , that the system has been putting them down , and they believed it . So long as you refuse to understand what white privilege means and that it exists , you'll never get what that means . Whenever one tries to explain people like you , you just close up your mind and mutter "" muh sjws "" to no end . To make it as simple as possible : Black people - higher chance of being born in ghettos - lower chance of pulling forward . Black Lives Matter is the misguided Kylo Ren of the world , not realizing their battle has already been won . There is still traces of institutional racism left over , not to mention classical instances ( i . e . the KKK and such groups ) . However those are not as powerful as the poverty trap they encounter themselves in . But what's happened since the Civil Rights movement ? Black communities are worse than ever . Not even remotely true and you know it . The black graduation high school rate is horrendous , black on black crime is an enormous issue , blacks are responsible for more than half of the murders in the U . S . , the single motherhood rate in the black community is something like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % Yes , that happens to people living in poverty traps . these kids have the balls to [ blame ] black the whites of the United states Blame goes to racism , not whites . We all know that classical and institutional racism is not as much of a problem as it was decades ago . We've slowly seeing improvements . You may have the occasional police officer not doing what's best , but that's not the point . The point is that blacks still continue to live in poverty and you can only blame the racial disparity on our history . They're where they are because of the sins of our ancestors . You have CNN selectively editing these idiots and showing it to their audience at dinner time , trying to convince people that there are crusaders out there against the riots - - when in reality all they can find are more blacks inciting violence . You have blacks calling for whites to get beat up and CSU offering segregated dorms to combat micro-aggression from white students . I mean - - the list goes on and on and on . These are just ones I've come up with off the top of my head that are fresh in my mind . But where are the prominent blacks speaking out ? Where are the Martin Luther Kings ? The closest things we have are guys like this who try to talk some sense into people , and what happens when he sits down with the president of the NAACP chapter in Compton and a "" preacher ? "" She calls him an Uncle Tom , white , an Oreo ... More strawmanning . Again , want me to pull out videos of whites inciting violence ? What would that prove ? Nothing , just like you proved nothing . You wanna prove African Americans are mostly violent ? Pull out some statistics . Learn to think . INB <NUMBER> you pull out crime statistics . Now we literally have blacks blocking streets , trashing neighborhoods , beating up white people , kidnapping and torturing people , and NO ONE WILL SAY ANYTHING . This is the same shit as what's going on with Muslims in Sweden and Germany , and what is it going to take for us to get real with each other ? Oh cool , can I use the Dylan Roof example to prove that ALL whites are RACISTS , DEPLORABLES ? Also nice of you to compare blacks in the US to Muslim foreigners in Europe - complete racist , inexcusable garbage . Don't worry though , that only proves you are racist , not your entire demographic . No one will say anything until there is literally a race war in the streets . There wont be . Your fantasies aren't reality . And where are the sports stars speaking out ? Where are the black entertainers speaking out ? I know you think very highly of celebrities but these aren't the people blacks look up to . They look up to President Obama and such , they love him and are extraordinarily proud of him ( sometimes to a fault , I admit ) The support for these Black Lives Matter terrorists from the Left and the SJWs and mainstream media is only adding fuel to the fire . Oh lawd . Protests and obscure Tumblr blogs history of institutionalized racism . If you care about any of this shit , arm yourself with some statistics like the ones I linked above TIL youtube videos = statistics The black community may need help . Let's elect a retarded President and have him stack his cabinet with donors , globalists and Goldman Sachs executives , that will help . Urban areas are shit right now , but that doesn't change the fact that there is a culture issue Urban issues , ghettos are the cause of the culture issues . If we reject globalists policies we will get closer to solving the issue but it might not be enough . But again , that wont happen under an administration run by globalists ."	EXP

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

7569	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

This was the reason we relocated home from living abroad - I had heard what he was doing from family members and I could hear it on the phone when I talked to her . So I immediately came over and played "" blocker "" and assumed the food slave role - so she could have relief . He didn't care WHO was serving him , just as long as he was being served .

I guess that means I should just call everyone a criminal , right ? Or should we maybe leave that reserved for the people who've been convicted ... I don't know , what do you think ? Shall we just call everyone a criminal and be done with it all ?	IMP

Unless you can give me verses from the Bible which directly correlate with Sharia Law ideals , or the backwards ideologies of Islam , then I highly recommend you piss right off .	EXP

Sure , those are people who mainly don't realize that the negative features of the US taht they complain about are primarily caused by blacks and various non-white hispanics . <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % of the US population consists of third world people with third world problems . How many people from Somalia have you actually spoken to ? Not that many , though there are plenty in my city . They usually aren't too keen on learning the language or doing much adapting of any kind to local customs and laws . Last time I looked Somali unemployment in Sweden was something hilariously bad like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % . Of those who are employed it's usually not an actual job , but tax-payer funded make-work that's primarily intended for the physically and mentally disabled . After Gypsies they're probably fighting with Australian Aboriginals for the second place as the worst people in the world .	IMP

I don't care if they really are fat because of genes and not gluttony . Obesity is still not sexy . What we're talking about is being sexually attractive on a very low level without factoring in personality , mutual hobbies , wealth or other contributing factors to attractiveness ... in other words I'm defining "" sexy "" as possessing easily seen physical traits that based on our hard wired instincts let others know that you are healthy and will probably make healthy babies when paired with a healthy member of the opposite sex . So yes , it's genetic discrimination . We discriminate based on genes all the time because well ... it's in our genes to do so It's not like people with Down's Syndrome are on the covers of Playboy or Playgirl with people liked up to have intercourse with them .
