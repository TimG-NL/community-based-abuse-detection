18	uncensorednews	I don't think that argument makes sense . I think most analysts were quite confident in making their predictions about the outcome of the election . They just happened to be wrong . Suppose there are two possible outcomes , each equally probable , which are expected to produce a gain of $ <NUMBER> for the first outcome , or $ <NUMBER> for the second . The market would adjust to an expected gain of $ <NUMBER> rather than hanging around $ <NUMBER> or even lower due to uncertainty . If the first outcome is considered more likely than the second , then the market would anticipate gains of greater than $ <NUMBER> depending on how probable the first outcome is believed to be . If the first outcome is considered to be a complete certainty , then the market would adjust to an anticipated gain of $ <NUMBER> . Outcomes are weighted according to their perceived likelihood . The outcome of the election caught almost everyone by surprise . I find it highly unlikely that people were weighting the possibility of a Trump victory very heavily . Stock prices shot up when he won because the expected outcome , a Hillary victory , was one in which stocks were expected to perform worse than they would have under Trump . To go back to the $ <NUMBER> and $ <NUMBER> model , people thought Hillary was almost sure to win and that she was the lower performing outcome . Stocks were adjusting to something like $ <NUMBER> or $ <NUMBER> ( much closer to Hillary's side , since her victory was weighted more heavily ) , and when she lost the market corrected to the $ <NUMBER> expectation . If Hillary had won , there would have been a small negative adjustment as the relatively slim chance of Trump winning and producing the higher outcome would have fallen to zero , dropping from $ <NUMBER> or $ <NUMBER> down to $ <NUMBER> . The spike is a result of Trump being expected to produce greater returns for the stock market as well as the low probability of victory that almost all analysts had given him going into the night of the election .

30	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

142	IAmA	Oh you play ? Yay That's so cool I'm not a goalie unfortunately . But I have seen our goalies doing a lot of fun drills . I think it's important that you focus on your leg strenh and reaction time . Our goalies do land drills with tennis balls to work on their reaction time . For example , stand facing a wall , a few feet away , and get someone to stand behind you . Get them to toss the tennis ball at the wall so it bounces back towards you , and you can try to catch it . That will help you with your hand / eye coordination , and your reaction time . And they do leg strenhening with jumping drills in the water . For example , have your coach hold a stick , or pole above your head in the water , and have you jump to touch it while he moves it to different positions . As you get better he can move it higher / farther from you , and you can do it for longer periods of time . There are a lot of good American Universities that offer scholarships . If you're good ( which I'm sure you are ) ) you'll get noticed with scouting . You could always make a highlight reel of some of your games . Get your parents , or a friend to video you playing and when you're getting ready to apply to University send those videos in I'm not sure if any of this information is helpful - but I hope so Keep training and working hard Good luck	NOT

Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right ( negative freedom ) or far-left ( positive freedom ) social politics . But since , neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject , it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents , objectives and constraints . Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them .

So we see people getting beheaded on youtube , and airstrikes , and suicide bombers . Yet the statistics don't lie , fewer people per capita are dying today from violence worldwide than at nearly any other time in human history . I wonder if the people of Nagasaki and Hiroshima felt that way after having their shadows burned into the walls . You have no idea how devastating a land invasion would have been . Japan had been training its citizenry to fight U . S . soldiers with bamboo spears if necessary . For both the Japanese citizens , as well as the American troops stuck fighting a guerrilla war against desperate people defending their home soil . The death toll from the nuclear strikes is just shy of 200k , and while that may seem like a staggering number , it is a fraction of what would have happened if we were forced to invade by land and air . While I in no way condone the targeting of civilian targets , especially with weapons as horrible as those , the objective fact is that it saved lives on both sides of the war . What a gross oversimplification Not really , it is just that your view of the world is shaped by your media outlets . It is not even remotely realistic .	EXP

228	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats .

246	atheism	I have no evidence to support that hypothesis , so at this point I must conclude that no , I am not . To support my previous statement however , we are able to measure gravity with tremendous precision , and it varies depending on where you stand on Earth due to your physical proximity to core . Similarly , gravity is weaker on the moon than it is on Earth , and the moon's gravity also affects Earth's rotation . Meanwhile , there is also the other planets of the solar system and of course the Sun itself , not to mention the contents of the milky way galaxy . Even a planetoid's gravity is not constant , as it accrues or loses mass its gravity consequently alters . Therefore , I conclude that gravity itself is subjective and not immutable .

369	uncensorednews	You're doing a lot of side-stepping to avoid the very simply observation I made ( which I did without either condemning or condoning ) which is that the EU seems to violate the sovereignty of the nations which are in it . Yes , everyone who is in the EU agreed to be in the EU , and yes , the EU can make exceptions to its directives , and yes , the countries can violate the directives ( though fining those countries is absolutely a punishment ; a punishment that is meant to be a deterrent is still a punishment after all ) . The fact is they're still being told to do things by other countries which is ipso facto an infringement of sovereignty whether it's a good idea or not . If you have to e . g . restrict gun ownership or be punished by other countries then they are not respecting your sovereignty regardless of their motivation , the severity of punishment , moral justification , chance of appeal , etc . In fact , I will go even further than that and say that to be allowed to violate a directive is still a violation of sovereignty , because it is them granting you permission to do something and thus still being under their control , rather than you simply deciding to do something and them respecting your freedom to do it . You cannot give permission to someone you don't have authority over .	IMP

511	uncensorednews	"Your morality system was designed for a utopian world that we don't live in at the moment . It sounds like you believe that discourse is the solution to the problem , and not systematic targetting and elimination of the muslim threats . One way you might speed up in getting with the program is to go to a mosque and have a discussion with some muslims and see how far you get . I can understand your frustration with reddit dog piling on you for defending the ideology that all men are created equal , however , in the time of war , the law falls silent . We're at war with an evil mafia and international supremacy and you seem to be positioning yourself on the side of the middle eastern muslims . So naturally you're going to be catching flak . Philosophies are like trees , and yours is small and doesn't account for all situations because you sound young and ideological . Yours is heavy on the trunk with the core ideology , but weak on leaves , it doesn't work in all situations because you haven't been around . You've been living in a bubble world protected from evil . I suspect you've never had to defend yourself from people who wanted to kill you on a battlefield . And hopefully you never will have to do that . There are people inside America now who wish death upon America , Israel and Europe . These people are willing to take guns and bombs and kill infidels because they have no sense of self , no greater cause . When you position yourself as "" moral support "" for those people , trying to prevent us from classifying them and ridiculing them and fucking up their shit , naturally reddit is going to downvote you because you aren't toeing the party line . We're trying to get everyone to lock arms and man their stations to make America great again by removing the cancerous invaders , and here you are trying to prevent us from getting the job done because someone might get their feelings hurt . We're trying to bang the war drums and get everyone to dogpile on the muslims so we can round them up and deport them home so they can be happy and make the middle east great again , we need everyone , including you , to help eliminate the systemic threat to civilizations in America and Europe . When we see you picking at ideological threads like : "" Oh someone might be discriminated against "" or "" Oh you're being racist "" or "" Oh you're using information that you're not allowed to use to identify enemy soldiers "" . Naturally we're going to tell you to stfu and man your station . I know it's hard , and it's comforting to fall back to an ideology that made america in the first place , but war is a very different thing . When we have decided that these invaders and soldiers need to be pressed back toward Muslim countries , we don't want to hear you saying that we're being "" totally mean about it "" . We know we're doing the wrong thing by being racist bigots , by being discriminatory by classifying their eyebrow ridges and nose arches and earlobe status , furry beard and color of the skin . We KNOW that in an ideological utopia nobody would ever judge each other based on these superficial aspects . However , this is not that time . Now we are in war , and in war , we need to use anything and everything at our disposal to classify and target the invading Muslims and get them deported . So when I , and others here see you shouting at the tail gunner to stop shooting at the soldiers , we're going to duct tape you to the seat and tell you to put your dime store philosophy on hold while we defend you from people who want you dead . They are soldiers , we are soldiers , and you've found yourself on the battlefield picking daisies and telling everyone to "" Just be nice "" . We've tried being nice , we tried it for fourteen hundred years . These Muslims want world domination , and nothing short of deportation , classification and elimination is going to stop them . I hope this at least sheds some light as to what is going on and how you might choose to either get the fuck out of the way and focus on something more productive , or get in the game and hold the party lines . If you want to talk philosophy and ideology and tell soldiers not to shoot , that's fine , just stay out of the way ."	EXP

527	IAmA	Hi , I really appreciated your post , you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field ( obviously , if you've got a PhD , you've put a lot of work into it , so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and , while I haven't personally contracted your services , I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough ) . I have a few questions , I do have a few mental health issues , but they aren't rare at all , and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals ( multiple psychiatrists , all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period , a psychologist , a social worker with a doctorate in social work , and some regular social workers , as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was <NUMBER> ( I'm <NUMBER> now , going to be <NUMBER> on Jan 21st , and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community ) . Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

( He drops shadow scales , which are necessary to make almost all Demonite equipment ) . Luckily , Bombs and Dynamite still blow up Ebonstone , and you've probably found a bunch of those from pots and chests already . Alternatively you can craft a summoning item for him like the Suspicious Eye , but you'll probably want to get items from the Shadow Orbs anyway . When you break Shadow Orbs an item will fall out - either a Musket , a Ball O ' Hurt , a Vilethorn , a Starpower Band , or an Orb of Light . Vilethorn is a spell which I find to make this boss laughably easy . However , you'll need mana to use it . For that you'll need to craft <NUMBER> Fallen Stars into a Mana Crystal , which gives you <NUMBER> max mana just like the Crystal Hearts you can find underground give you <NUMBER> max health . So , fighting the Corruption boss . I think you have to fight him at night but I honestly didn't ever check time of day and didn't have an issue . You'll be so far underground when you summon him that you can't do much in the way of an arena , but there should be a long horizontal corridor right above the shadow orbs . The boss is just a huge version of those annoying burrowing worms , so you want to try to get in the air a bit to see him coming . Build a platform or find a naturally occurring one , it's not a big deal . Like I said , I find the Vilethorn to just destroy this guy . It basically makes a slow moving thorn that does a piddly <NUMBER> damage , but each piece of the thorn lingers for a few seconds . Each section of the boss has independent health , so if you shoot your vilethorn straight into his head as he comes at you ( or just at a good angle so it goes pretty straight down his body ) it will hit like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> sections of him depending on his speed . This will wreck him quickly . The only issue is mana usage , and you'll run out until you start killing sections , but once you've done enough damage to kill sections they will drop items that restore <NUMBER> mana and you'll basically continually refill mana as you destroy him . If you do run out of mana you can just run up and smack him with a sword . Keep health potions to chug if you get hurt , but avoiding him isn't that hard . You should get enough shadow scales and demonite from him to make full Shadow Armor , which is a big upgrade in defense from Gold armor , and to make a Nightmare Pickaxe . If you don't , just blow up <NUMBER> more shadow orbs and fight him again . Also , killing shadow orbs has a chance to cause meteorites to fall . You can mine them with your Nightmare pickaxe to make Meteor Armor ( which is low defense but has special attributes ) and the awesome Meteor Hamaxe , which fuses your Hammer and Axe into one item and is way more powerful than the Demonite equivalents . Okay , after that the Dungeon will probably be your next trek . I think you could do the Jungle at this point too , but the Dungeon gives you way more shit way more quickly . To get in you have to fight Skeletor . Technically you can go in without killing him , but try it and see what happens ;) . To fight him , you talk to the Old Man NPC out front of the dungeon entrance at night . This takes way less prep and ballyhoo than the last boss . Try to make a long , straight platform to fight him on . Generally I just level off the top of the dungeon and extend it with wooden platforms . If you have Shadow Armor your <NUMBER> % movement bonus will allow you to stay away easily . The boss is a giant skull with two detached hands . He will float around swinging his hands at you most of the time , and will sometimes "" roar "" and then his head spins and flies at you . During this time his defense goes way down , I think , and he's super easy to hit . If you've been fortunate enough to have a Goblin Invasion already you'll probably have a Harpoon , which is ridiculous for this guy . The Harpoon is a unique weapon because it autofires when you hold down the mouse button and it will fire the instant the harpoon returns to the gun ( you'll know what I mean when you get one ) . This means you can stand next to something and hold down the attack button to attack it <NUMBER> times a second . You can just run in front of Skeletor while he's spin-attacking you and rack up absurd damage . If you don't have a harpoon , the easiest to get weapon is a Demonite bow with Unholy arrows ( which are crafted from normal arrows and the worms ' teeth dropped by Corruption enemies ) or fire arrows . You can also go for guns . If you got a Musket from a shadow orb then an Arms Dealer will move into an open house . He sells the Minishark for <NUMBER> gold , which is a ton at this point in the game and will make it a pain to get for a new player . If you do get one you can use plain musket balls for ammo or you can craft meteor shot with musket balls and Meteor ore . The Minishark is an automatic gun that will demolish anything pretty quickly but eat through ammo . You can also craft a Space Gun with a flintlock pistol ( sold by the arms dealer ) , meteorite ore and fallen stars . It's a gun that uses mana instead of ammo , but if you get full Meteor Armor it is free to use . That's a shitload of money and / or time , though , for something you can get done with a bow . Once you've destroyed him , you can enter the dungeon . It's got a bunch of chests and a ton of enemies , traps , etc . You'll get some really cool stuff in there , though . At that point you can take on the Jungle or Hell . The Jungle offers some unique equipment , like an upgraded grappling hook , but hell offers Molten equipment ."	NOT

But , if we act now , and protest , and let those we interact with know how we feel on this issue , and debate , and discuss , and improve our thoughts , as we have been on reddit , we have a chance of turning the tide .

979	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

1013	uncensorednews	They know exactly what they're doing . At the very least , they can understand when someone shows signs of distress or say ' no ' and yet continue . They have absolutely no remorse , and will act like pathetic animals the moment they get caught . People who commit these acts are pure evil . And to add insult to injury , ' they ' will use their lack of English and culture to get out of consequences , only to commit more inhumane acts . As their backwards religion testifies , they are here to conquer . I've worked with people like this , believe me when I tell you they will not pay you when they get the chance . They will not follow basic instructions . They will not read what they sign . They will put the blame on you the moment they see the opportunity . People like this have no honour . And for the rapes and child abuse running rampant in Europe , they are capable to commit evil acts against innocent lives because they only care to function their basic biological needs . It's in their genes . Education and signs will not stop pure evil . If it was up to me , every single one of them who has committed any of these acts would be deported on the spot . Our children have had their childhood's taken away . You cannot undo that .	EXP

1349	swtor	How do you get PvE gear ? A good start is just to PvP and trade Warzone Commendations for Mercenary Commendation and buy CHAMPION GEAR BAGS ( <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of each commendation ) . You can get lucky and get PvP modded gear that is ilvl <NUMBER> ( mods ) . Otherwise crafting is really good , take green level <NUMBER> items and reverse engineer them to the artifact quality . Get really good rolls and you can get triple secondary stats on them - only really sacrificing a bit of the main stats . Which to be honest isn't super big deal losing <NUMBER> STR when you gain <NUMBER> PWR instead . What's a Flashpoint and how do you find them ? Flashpoints are instances that are <NUMBER> - mans and have their own story and bosses , generally dropping better loot than quest rewards or crafting . You can find them in the Fleet stations , generally in the Drop Station of each larger ship . There are two on Ilum . What's the difference between a hardmode and a normal ? Boss ability wise there seems to be no difference between normal and hard-mode with the exception of a couple bosses now spawning adds . The major and most important difference is that every boss now gains an ENRAGE timer ( + <NUMBER> % DMG ) . So most of the bosses become a DPS race and healers should be DPSing whenever possible ( I recommend telling your tank to blow a cooldowns and bursting a good amount in that time frame ) . Most of the bosses are pretty easy and not super different from normal mode , some of their ability do not even increase in the amount of damage Trash is much much more difficult , highly recommend CC . Anything with a bestial animal seems to do crazy amount of damage as well as the elite robots not being a joke . How do you get gear tokens ? Final bosses in hard-mode flash points drop Columi gear token which seems to be the early raid equivalent . Otherwise as stated above CHAMPION GEAR BAGs house the PvP gear which is an excellent as well as solo-able gear up process . How do you get PVP gear ? ( And highend PVP gear ) By doing Warzones Stack up commendations ( <NUMBER> is the current cap of every commendation it seems ) , while leveling and PvPing you can get an entire gear set from the Fleet PvP vendors at levels <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> . If you have excess Warzone commendations convert it to Mercenary Commendations to prepare for an easier time gearing up at level - <NUMBER> . Gear bags contain either A ) <NUMBER> Centurion Commendations B ) <NUMBER> Centurion Commendation AND <NUMBER> Token for Champion level gear . Centurion commendations are used to buy the lesser Artifact gear for level <NUMBER> . There is also two PvP dailies as well as two Weekly quests . ( Win <NUMBER> Warzones & <NUMBER> Warefforts for the daily . ) ( Win <NUMBER> Warzone & <NUMBER> War efforts for the weekly ) Completing these will give you <NUMBER> bags per day and <NUMBER> per week . War efforts is taking part of Ilum PvP which is the far West part of the planet , you must destroy the enemy tank walkers and their battle station ( OR repair your turret at the base - there's a console at the base of the turret which fixes it ) Where are the daily quest hubs ? You must finish your main class story to do dailies , at least I'm fairly sure . First hub is in Ilum , there is another hub on Belvaius - generally someone in fleet will have a new quest informing you they need aid at a certain planet .	NOT

Still forced them to wake up at like 4AM - 6AM to play their matches and at times wait around for players who never show up which affects their sleep schedule and in-turn their play in other leagues such as the GSL ( JulyZerg I think it was woke up 4am once only to wait around till 9am to find out his opponent wasn't going to show ) which is complete BS . Really wasn't worth it to them to sacrifice so much for such a small chance to "" win it all "" no matter what the NASL wanted to do in terms of flight and hotel compensation . It's just a poor format for foreign players not to mention the lenh of one season is twice that of GSL Code-S . I understand its the "" NORTH AMERICAN Star League "" but still , it gives too much of an advantage to NA players to force their opponents to wake up at ridiculous times just to get their games in along with having to play on NA which hinders them even more by having 200ms + ping when they can focus on other tournaments such as the GSL which is way more prestigious . So lets be realistic for a minute : Koreans would be forced to play at ridiculous times , be forced to play on NA ( even if their opponent agrees to play on KOR / EU ) which gives them insane lag , Fly out to a <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> day tournament as late as the NASL decides ( meaning if they gotta be there Friday the NASL can just book a flight for thursday or whatever ) so they come in extremely jet lagged and tired and all of this for a tournament that runs TWO months ( <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> weeks ) and has the same prize pool as the GSL ... Oh , and did I mention it's also single elimination so ontop of being jet lagged , tired and the schedule taking it's toll on you for the last <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> weeks you also cannot afford to drop a series otherwise you've completely wasted your time . Really , the NASL is a JOKE and the only reason they offered what they offered to korean players is because they know their viewership and competition level would be on the decline without them .

2166	milliondollarextreme	"So fucking what ? Hippos share tons of genetic information with bananas , that doesn't mean that there are not meaningful differences between the two . Yes , and I share a lot of genetic information with people from Norway - - that doesn't mean I share any significant cultural values with Norwegians or even any identifiable characteristics , as an American , with Norwegian citizens . Is my character "" imprinted "" with the national character of Scandinavia , or am I more a product of the circle of American culture in which I've grown up ? What I take from the AAA statement is that trying to understand some underlying cultural values of someone based on "" race "" or physical characteristics is absurd . Does an African-American share the same values or inherent character of someone from Ethiopia simply because they are both descended from Sub-Saharan African people ? They're probably more "" similar "" to the "" white "" guy that lives in the next neighborhood over than someone of their supposed "" race . "" If race exists as an underlying quality of intelligence and moral character , why do so many Sub-Saharan African immigrants succeed in the US educational system when their "" racial "" counterparts don't ? To me , that suggests a cultural problem within the US rather than an underlying problem of "" race , "" because you would expect all people of a "" race "" to behave according to their inherent moral character rather than according to the environment in which they were raised ( i . e . nature vs . nurture ) . Dude , no one is saying that we'd be living in a utopia if it weren't for immigrants - people just don't want to be importing populations with higher rates of violence than the natives . Suppose I'm an American moving to England - - how absurd would it be for people in England say , "" Well look at the incidences of sexual assault among the white American population . Obviously , white Americans value sexual assault in their culture . "" Or say that an English person was moving to America , and I were to say , well the BBC covered up sex crimes , therefore this British person must be a sexual deviant . Cultures don't get together at a meeting and say , "" Well let's commit such-and-such crimes . "" Confusing what some segment of the population does with the ability of human beings to develop a moral code is absurd . Sam Hyde specifically picked out Rotherham as evidence that immigrants are likely to increase the rate of sex crimes in England - - which is about as sensible as saying that the native English population increases the rate of sex crimes in England because there have been sex rings within native groups . Most English natives would be disgusted by Jimmy Savile and most Pakistani people would be disgusted by Rotherham . Yes , there are immigrants from countries where there is organized crime - - but it's not as though saying that if you emigrate from Japan you're likely to be a member of the Yakuza or if you emigrate from Italy you're likely to be a member of the Mafia , any more than if you're from Pakistan you're sympathetic to al-Qaeda . Thirdly , the arguments Sam Hyde makes are not exactly new , and <NUMBER> years ago they probably would have put him outside of the norm if he wasn't <NUMBER> % descended from English ancestors , preferably if they came over on the Mayflower . German-Americans were seen as sympathetic to their home country during WW1 and WW2 , and because a small segment of the Italian population was sympathetic to Anarchist causes , Italian immigrants were lynched . This isn't even getting into how Irish or Jewish immigrants were treated . Many Jewish refugees were turned away from the US when Hitler was in power , and ended up in concentration camps . I'm sure a lot of US citizens didn't want the "" burden "" of immigrants "" diluting "" American culture then , either ."	EXP

2360	OperationPullRyan	Statement by the President on H . R . <NUMBER> : Today I have signed into law H . R . <NUMBER> , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <NUMBER> . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over <NUMBER> pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section <NUMBER> affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> U . S . C . <NUMBER> note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the <NUMBER> AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section <NUMBER> confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section <NUMBER> ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section <NUMBER> ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the <NUMBER> AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section <NUMBER> seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section <NUMBER> is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section <NUMBER> provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section <NUMBER> provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past <NUMBER> years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

You seemed to forget that the whole point of Jesus is to ask for forgiveness when you break a law , which is the whole point of my mention of an easy-out . Which is to say that those laws still apply , but clearly most Christians don't actually follow them , and that's because they can just have Jesus absolve them of their breaking of God's laws . God says himself , in the Old Testament , that his laws ( covenant ) will be different in the future . There are numerous references in the New Testament to Jesus being and / or bringing that new covenant . He also repeatedly states that within this new covenant there are only two rules : Love God above any other , and love your neighbor as yourself Eeeehhhnnn . Sorry , that's a wrong answer , Jimmy .

Christians just choose to ignore them because stoning gays is fuckin ' barbaric , and they like shellfish . Discussing whether or not this premise makes sense under the idea of an omnipotent God is irrelevant to the discussion of whether Christianity is based on morals while Islam is based on coercion and violence . The discussion matters in the context that the religion isn't true anyways . If God is an all-powerful being , then he'd have just started with a set of rules he didn't have to make edits to in the first place . Fuck sake , he could literally rewrite time , or make modifications on the fly , and all of that is under the assumption that he's just all-powerful , and not all-knowing .

The point being , Corporations have been allowed to get to where they are and develop monopolies in part because of the Government , big government lends itself to corruption and the reason Corporations can "" buy and own "" government officials is tied in with that . Capitalism in it's purest form would bend more towards competition , the free market destroys monopolies in a sense seeing as how no one company is perfect and there's always a better way to do things , a cheaper way to do things , and some investment group will find a person that gives them the edge over a competitor . That being said I'm not ignorant of history , Teddy Roosevelt and the Robber Barons , etc . I'm not saying I'm full An-Cap on this , I recognize the NEED for Government at some levels , but really the Non-Aggression Principle does have a lot of merit considering companies like Monsanto might fuck you over in a grocery store or on a family farm but the US Government is the only entity threatening you with M - <NUMBER> carbines ."

2831	uncensorednews	In <NUMBER> more years ethnically German people will be a minority in Germany . Quite possibly that could even happen sooner depending on some factors , but it will happen by then if nothing absolutely dramatic happens to stop it . Even IF that happens : What's the big deal ? The different german nations all had a very diverse population ( well , except the one that tried to fix this ) . I'm not sure where you get the idea that the german governmental system was always vulnerable to dictatorships . We only had one dictatorship ( not counting legitimate monarchs ) . And the current government has some means to defend itself . For example , we can strip people of their citizenship and their basic rights if they are a threat to the constitutional order ( and then exile or hang them ) . And for the unity and shared interests : Do you KNOW german history ? The german nations never fared well with shared interests and a homogeneous society . We have feuds between cities and regions that are older than most countries . We have real people , who really think we should rebuild the Wall to separate east and west Germany again . And some folks ( on both sides ) think Bavaria should do it's own thing again or join Austria . Unity is superficial here ( I imagine it is in most places ) - and always was . We have the common interest to live in a rich and developed country , preferably near the top of the global economy . But that interest is also shared by the new arrivals you might disapprove of ( normal migrants , legitimate and illegitimate refugees alike ) . Germany and Germans , and even all of European cultural diversity will be extinguished in not too many generations . That started to happend post-WW <NUMBER> . At first thanks the increasing american influence on pop culture , then due to the ever bigger factor of globalization and now because borders don't really mean anything in europe . I grew up in a Germany that was already dominated by imported cultural goods . The good stuff on radio and television is either american or asian . Clothing styles are mostly influenced by pop culture idols ( who , you guessed it , are mostly americans ) . I can name you some traditions I know , but those feel more like a nod to our heritage and not as a part of my identity . So , if you tell me to worry about the european culture , I'm sorry to say it's to late . I don't give two shits about that , because I grew up in a world where ( national and cultural ) borders don't mean much .	IMP

Even after the war , when the evil consequences of its policies should have been clear , when Germany herself began to recognize her obligation to what was left of the Jewish people , Britain continued to fight against the establishment of a Jewish state , battling attempts to resettle Jewish refugees , even arming and providing military advisors to the Arab armies that in <NUMBER> tried to finish the job Hitler started . I am referring now to the book The rape of Palestine ( <NUMBER> ) by William Ziff Ziff explains how , long before <NUMBER> , British authorities used every bureaucratic device possible to reduce the number of Jews allowed into the country , while completely overlooking the uncontrolled immigration of Arabs who flocked in to take advantage of the jobs created by the Zionists . “ Illegal ” Jews were hunted down and punished . Not only did the authorities try to prevent Jews from arriving , they viciously discriminated against the ones that were already here . The Jewish population was heavily taxed ( as they do today , the Arabs tended to favor informal business practices that avoided taxation ) , but the revenues , which Ziff tells us were plentiful thanks to Jewish enterprise , were either retained by the government for its own purposes or used almost entirely to benefit the Arab sector .

I can't begin to tell you , my fellow Redditors , just how much that makes my Democratic Socialist head spin , but frankly Greenwald has laid it all out really well . Holy . SHIT Seriously , my fellow Progressives , this blows my goddamned mind . Take a look at my comment history to see that this is no Ron Paul shill account - in fact I just wrapped up a <NUMBER> day exchange with Ron Paul supporter arguing why he's a nutbag , etc . ¹ I still kind of think that , but now I think of all the choices , INCLUDING OBAMA , Ron Paul may just be the best thing we've got going . I don't see him overall as being a Progressive's ideal , by any stretch of the imagination , but godDAMNit he actually is a lot more progressive than Obama . Would I rather see Bernie Sanders as president - OF COURSE - but that's never going to happen ( he doesn't want the job for one thing ) . I'm a Eugene Debs / Bernie Sanders Democratic Socialist . I am not a fan of common Libertarian social stances . But if Ron Paul were in office , I wouldn't be too worried about those things . A President Paul would only be able to act unilaterally as Commander in Chief . This means his social policy changes would require the endorsement of Congress - not likely to happen with a cohesive Progressive Caucus . However as Commander in Chief , he could immediately withdraw troops from Afghanistan and other conflict areas ( overt and covert ) , he could immediately declare an end to the "" War on Terror "" , etc . ( there is one potential downside to his doing this , but I'll footnote it below . ² ) All in all , I don't think he'd be as dangerous as we Progressives tend to view him ( and yes , I still think his social positions are largely dangerous ) . Moreover , if we allow Obama to continue on his path we only assure ourselves of a now known quantity . Obama has been a very slick politician and has done SOME progressive things , but overall he's very easily more of a centrist than a progressive . He has surrounded himself with his Goldman Sachs buddies , has signed the extension of the PATRIOT Act , has reversed his campaign promise to shut down GITMO , has authorized assassination of US citizens without trial ( or even accusation ) , and today signed NDAA . I still see Ron Paul as generally a nut on economic and social issues , but when laid out the way Greenwald has masterfully done here , I can honestly say there's actually a greater chance of my voting for Ron Paul now than Obama . Half an hour ago you couldn't have convinced me of this . Now ( for now ) I am virtually certain of it . MIND = BLOWN ___ ¹ I will be messaging this person to concede my newfound "" support "" for Ron Paul . ² My big concern with someone like Ron Paul bringing home the troops en masse , is that where a progressive president would try to put them to work on infrastructure projects , ensure they have adequate support from the social safety net , and otherwise "" take care "" of them , I see Ron Paul potentially just letting them fend for themselves in keeping with his Libertarian views .

3113	milliondollarextreme	"I'm just gonna talk about World Peace now because it has been aired on the television . Yeah I agree that it isn't always ha ha funny like your usual entertainment-comedy-laugh-generating-show and MDE doesn't really use the same methods for generating laughter within you in the same way as other entertainment producers . As I see it mainstream comedy producers will have writers sitting in a room discussing and planning how they can design entertainment that will make the audience laugh with their fabricated joke-lines . They create what they think will make you laugh that is , and often just not being passionate in the creating but copying other entertainment producers methods so they can sell entertainment that is satisfying enough for the same type of audience . The difference between this type of comedy and MDE , I think , is that MDE creates what they themselves think is funny snd sometimes they will use like internal jokes that is not relatable to all , but the whole thing is more real in a sense and more relatable . I felt like a real human being when I watched World Peace and when I'm watching like Two and a Half Men ( or John Oliver etc . ) I'm feeling like a consumer or slave to a certain type of scheme or way of thinking . So yeah I think what MDE does is meaningful and generative in this sense that it is original and doesn't pander to any specific scheme or typical comedy methods designed for business and cheap laughs , and maybe this is related to why they chose the name "" World Peace "" because the content of the show , besides the fun and creative works , gives you a sense of not being a bitch or slave to a certain type of scheme or way of thinking . Maybe ur friend doesn't like MDE comedy becaused it doesn't tell him when to laugh which leaves him with a void and feeling of confusion but this is what some like with MDE too ."	EXP

Collusion : secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy , especially in order to cheat or deceive others . If all of them together decide to stop serving a type of person , that's collusion . Collusion is already illegal . Making discrimination laws on top of that is meant to do the same thing : make collusion illegal . Because if they don't all decide to not serve one person , then there's another business to always give your money to . If a community doesn't support a business that is being unfair to people , it'll go out of business . Thus , people learn they can't do that . ^ ^	EXP

The white color of many of the victims in Cleon's large scale works such as the Paris mural is meant to symbolize the purity and innocence behind those characters , and the black color is meant to symbolize the brutality and sin in those characters .

3434	explainlikeimfive	From simple.wikipedia.org - Conductors usually beat time with their right hand . This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries ( when they start playing ) or to show them to play louder or softer . Most conductors have a stick called a “ baton ” . It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat . Other conductors prefer not to use a baton . A conductor stands on a small platform called a “ rostrum ” . To be a good conductor is not easy . It is not just a question of giving a steady beat . A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes . They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make . They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants . Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals . They make everything clear through the way they conduct . In short , they are showing the musicians the beat of the song , and telling different sections when it's time for them to get louder or softer , or pointing out whether or not they are too loud or two soft , among many other things .

3461	AskReddit	"My sister . Lived with her for four years in college in an off-campus apartment . Her room , and by room I mean the place where she slept , was nothing more than a floor hamper . There was only one place in the entire room where you could view the "" carpet "" , a three by two foot section in front of a floor mirror where she would sit and apply makeup every day . Needless to say , I put "" carpet "" in quotations earlier because what you could view here was technically carpeting , but no longer the mauve color like in MY room , but a mottled splattering of reds , pinks , browns , tans , and blacks . The rest of the floor was covered in dunes of dirty clothes that measured between half a foot to two feet thick in places . It was like walking on a water bed when I would have to trek through her room to collect all the dirty dishes when I had nothing to eat on . Our cat , angry at life and at her , would periodically pee on her clothes . and cover them ( like a litterbox ) . One would think that this would entice her to clean ... but no ... she would just live in the stink and I was eventually forced to retreat entirely to my bedroom in the back and keep the door closed with the window open . When she moved out , I had huge plans for her spare room . I was going to put in some workout equipment , make it a nice man cave . So I rented a carpet cleaner . thirty minutes , one broken steam cleaner , and a 3ft by <NUMBER> ft patch of clean carpet later , I was overpowered by the smell . I closed the door , stuffed towels in the gap and walked away . When I moved out five months later I went to the office and turned in my key .

3499	politics	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

Also , to say that the limp-wristed , flamboyant gay guy doesn't exist is ridiculous . There are definitely gay guys who fall in line with that stereotype . A lot of stereotypes exist because there is truth in them . You also , I think , misunderstand exactly why atheists are so hated . The common person on the street has most likely not heard of Dawkins or Hitchens . Bill Maher and Penn Jillette are entertainers , so I'm sure more people have heard of them , but they don't really think of atheism first when they think of them . Bill Maher is a comedian . Penn Jillette is an illusionist . People hate and distrust atheists because many times , they feel that their religious background gives them some kind of monopoly on ethics and morality . They think atheists can't care about something bigger than themselves ( which is wrong , we can , it just happens not to be a god ) , and therefore don't have any reason to have moral or ethical concerns .

In other words , a Skinner box is a representation of the real world . There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn . To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" . To put it more simply : everything is a Skinner box in this sense , as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning . The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule . And again , practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered . tl ;d r : Yes , games are like Skinner boxes .

Most of them are at the point of complete and utter delusion and even at the very best they know how to sling fat logic . What concerns me the most is that FAs are beginning to take a stranglehold over public discourse and are getting stronger and stronger in mass . Sure , we got a few subs which are overloading with hate but they seem to win everytime they play da feelz card ( which is virtually everytime ) . We need to immobilise and put an end to this wishy washy feelz detriment that will literally consume our planet in due time .	EXP

As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation , there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends . I was <NUMBER> years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure .

4026	uncensorednews	I agree , up to a point . The actions you describe are ridiculous , and certainly are evidence of an unwillingness to experience the world through anything but this limited perspective , which needs to demonize what it disagrees with . Moral self-licensing can be incredibly infuriating to deal with . I don't know , maybe I am being naive . You're certainly right that a tone of debate slanted toward winning people over works on an insignificant number of people . But I wouldn't call it stepping on eggshells , either . People , in general , react emotionally first and logically after , to justify their reactions . This I believe . As such , it is exceedingly difficult to use logic to change anyone's mind , but likewise emotion , since it locks them into a way of thinking which both feels right and seems logically justifiable . This is the problem , as I see it , because if someone reacts emotionally to the discourse , rather than the subject matter , people will inevitably use flawed reasoning to reach a conclusion , eventually giving rise to cognitive dissonance , which makes it all but impossible to ever reach them again . But , look , I don't want to tell anyone how to talk , think or behave . I just suggest it's worth considering , because there's a lot of fence-sitters out there who don't know how to make up their minds , but who will simply react as I described in lieu of entertaining the notion that others have valid opinions , too .

4128	milliondollarextreme	Let me help you with something . Growing up , my parents got divorced when I was <NUMBER> . During that period , I lived with my mom and she sacrificed everything on her own to make sure I had a decent place to live and eat while getting through school . During this time I treated my mom like shit , wasn't thankful for what I had and was generally disrespectful to her . It will dawn on you as you get older that your mom is only doing what she knows best . She's trying , and even though she may not be as smart as you wish she was , she still hasn't given up on you and loves you unconditionally . Open up to your mom , and talk with her without ever raising your voice . Use a tactical vocabulary and persuasion techniques to solidify a conversation and ease a tense situation . When she gives you a moment to reflect on yourself and your behavior , don't take offense and get upset . Odds are you actually are being a douche to your mother and you don't realize it . When I was your age I said some terrible shit to my mother that haunts me to this day . I can still see and feel the raw emotion emitting from my moms soul ; she couldn't believe her own son could treat her so bad . Now I'll admit moms are not easy to reason with , specially single moms who aren't up to par with intellecutal standards of a teenager . But before you go throwing words about your mom , Imagine her calling you one last time as she's impaled in her driver seat from a truck wreck to call and say she loves you . And for the rest of your life , the one person you've known the longest in your life will be gone forever . And the only memories you will have of being younger with your mom will be rude sentiments and horrid verbal abuse .	EXP

4164	comicbooks	I think this article demonstrates a pretty limited understanding of the X-Men mythos . The whole concept of mutantkind was developed <NUMBER> ) as an easy and convenient way of creating a whole lot of super-heroes without convoluted origin stories and <NUMBER> ) as an allegory that can fit pretty much any minority group in America . Yes , the X-Men fight to save a world that “ hates and fears them , ” but if all mutants came pre-equipped with overtly aggressive powers , there ’ s not much of a story in defending the group , is there ? They wouldn ’ t need the protection and influence of the X-Men if being a mutant meant you were a preshrunk asskicking machine . That ’ s the whole point of Charles Xavier , and it drives the occasional moral ambiguity of his mission , and its relation to Magneto ’ s . He , like Magneto , recruits young mutants , takes them under his tutelage , and trains them to weaponize their mutant powers for his own agenda . His agenda is inherently benevolent and peaceful , which separates him from Magneto , but his methods are very similar . Until Planet X that is , which is a vastly UNDERRATED X-Men story . It accomplished two important things . First , it clearly and fundamentally delineated Xavier ’ s morality from Magneto ’ s megalomania . At the end of the day , Magneto is the primary antagonist to the X-Men , and Morrison brought his violent agenda to its logical conclusion . Planet X was always Magneto ’ s end-game , the extermination or subservience of mankind to its mutant successors . It just took getting mixed up with mind-altering drugs and personality-altering bacterial consciousness to drive the morally ambiguous Magneto to this decidedly evil mission . And why is there any problem with Magneto using power-enhancing drugs ? He didn ’ t know what Kick was – no one did . His mutant utopia was butchered , he was paralyzed , and the fate of mutantkind looked more dangerous than ever . It was time for both Magneto and Professor X to rethink and reapply their worldviews in extreme ways ; Professor X went public and launched the X-Corporation as a multinational peacekeeping force , and Magneto planned his most devastating and deadly terrorist attack to date . And he did so by the means available to him , which meant augmenting his powers and infiltrating the X-Men , his most frustrating opponents . How is taking Kick any different than using Fabian Cortez ’ s powers to enhance his powers while destroying his body , as he did under Chris Claremont in the 90s ? Same principle . Second , it established a new dynamic which broke the binary opposition between Xavier and Magneto . Their dueling visions of mutantkind ’ s future dominated the X-Men mythos since its inception ; Morrison showed the inherent flaws in Magneto ’ s violent resistance , as well as Charles Xavier ’ s passive idealism . There ’ s room for additional , morally ambiguous , subjective interpretations of mutantkind that transcend good versus evil or domination versus subservience . Morrison opened the floodgates for new stories and ideas , which were promptly closed by less creative and progressive writers and editors who decided to undo all the significant changes Morrison had brought to the X-Men . Characters like Beak , without clearly developed offensive powers , are representative of this new dynamic . Yes , under the training of Charles Xavier , he was beginning to hone his unfortunate mutation and master the power of flight . ( We saw in Here Comes Tomorrow that continued evolution and training created Beak the super-hero ) . But by his own admission , he refused to be “ anyone ’ s soldier . ” You have to accept a place in the stories for characters like Beak who are simply uninterested in the seemingly endless power struggle between Xavier and Magneto , and who aspire to a different , simpler dream . Likewise , you have to allow for the possibility of revolutionaries like Quentin Quire , whose views clash with Xavier ’ s and are even more extreme than Magneto ’ s . Morrison contributed a lot of terrific stories to the X-Men mythos , ones that embraced every aspect of its legacy , from the crazy space-operas to the evolutionary struggle . In the process , he opened to door to a lot of potential new stories , an opportunity that , in my opinion , has not been taken advantage of . Tl ;d r : Grant Morrison may have provided a lot of unpopular shakeups to the X-Men mythos , but all of these shakeups were pretty logical extensions of existing trends , characters , and dynamics . And , not to be snobby , but anyone who hasn't read The Invisibles isn't going to understand Morrison anyway , and should do so for his own wellbeing .	NOT

4178	AdviceAnimals	"Here's a story : In Algebra <NUMBER> I had serious issues with a teacher who failed me because I didn't show work . Every homework would get zero credit because I didn't show work . The teacher's reason ? I could have stolen the answers from somebody . "" Fair enough , "" I said . Instead of doing my homework at home , I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures . I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started . For a while the teacher seemed alright with this , on homework at least . Tests came and I ended up with zeros again . "" Why ? "" I would ask . I would check my answers with those my classmates got , and I had gotten the answers right . So what was the problem ? The teacher never gave me a real answer . We even had a parent teacher conference over it . The teacher told my dad , he's a very gifted kid in math . He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial . My argument was basically , why should I show work for such basic math ? Should I write out every <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> as well ? How much is too much ? Also , if I get the answers right , what's the problem ? Well , the teacher never gave me an answer besides "" Do it because I say so "" , so I never did it . So I failed Algebra <NUMBER> while passing the state algebra test and getting 99th percentile in those stupid state tests . Now I'm in college taking Calculus <NUMBER> , and still not showing work for algebra problems .

4181	milliondollarextreme	Woah that looks fun , let me try : Great and manifold were the blessings , most dread Sovereign , which Almighty God , the Father of all mercies , bestowed upon us the people of England , when first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and reign over us . For whereas it was the expectation of many , who wished not well unto our Sion , that , upon the setting of that bright Occindental Star , Queen Elizabeth , of most happy memory , some thick and palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land , that men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk , and that it should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State ; the appearance of Your Majesty , as of the Sun in his strenh , instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists , and gave unto all that were well affected exceeding cause of comfort ; especially when we beheld the Government established in Your Highness , and Your hopeful Seed , by an undoubted Title ; and this also accompanied with peace and tranquillity at home and abroad . But among all of our joys , there was no one that more filled our hearts than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word among us , which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the riches of the earth ; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself , not only to the time spent in this transitory world , but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven . Then not to suffer this fall to the ground , but rather to take it up , and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your Highness did leave it ; nay , to go forward with the confidence and resolution of a man , in maintaining the truth of Christ , and propagating it far and near is that which hath so bound and firmly knit the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You , that Your very name is precious among them : their eye doth behold You with comfort , and they bless You in their hearts , as that sanctified Person , who , under God , is the immediate author of their true happiness . And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay , but every day increaseth and taketh strenh , when they observe that the zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go backward , but is more and more kindled , manifesting itself abroad in the farthest parts of Christendom , by writing in defence of the truth , ( which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be healed , ) and every day at home , by religious and learned discourse , by frequenting the house of God , by hearing the Word preached , by cherishing the teachers thereof , by caring for the Church , as a most tender and loving nursing father . There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and religious affection in Your Majesty ; but none is more forcible to declare it to others than the vehement and perpetuated desire of accomplishing and publishing of this work , which now , with all humility , we present unto Your Majesty . For when Your Highness had once , out of deep judgement , apprehended how convenient it was , that , out of the Original sacred Tongues , together with comparing of the labours , both in our own and other foreign languages , of many worthy men who went before us , there should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the English tongue ; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite those to whom it was commended , that the Work might be hastened , and that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner , as a matter of such importance might justly require . And now at last , by the mercy of God , and the continuance of our labours , it being brought unto such a conclusion , as that we have great hopes that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby , we hold it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty , not only as to our King and Sovereign , but as to the principal mover and author of the Work ; humbly craving of your most Sacred Majesty , that , since things of this quality have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented persons , it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as Your Highness is ; whose allowance and acceptance of our labours shall more honour and encourage us , than all the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us . So that if , on the one side , we shall be traduced by Popish persons at home or abroad , who therefore will malign us , because we are poor instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto the people , whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness ; or if , on the other side , we shall be maligned by self-conceited brethren , who run their own ways , and give liking unto nothing but what is framed by themselves , and hammered on their anvil , we may rest secure , supported within by the truth and innocency of a good conscience , having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity , as before the Lord , and sustained without by the powerful protection of Your Majesty's grace and favour , which will ever give countenance to honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and uncharitable imputations . The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy days , that , as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many singular and extraordinary graces , so You may be the wonder of the world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity , to the honour of that great God , and the good of his Church , through Jesus Christ our Lord and only Saviour .

4183	sjwhate	"I mean yeah sure but I don't think the problem here is that they shredded a printing of the Constitution . Rather than actually talking to these kids about why its "" triggering "" or "" oppressive "" and how they can deal with it ( or at least sending them to someone who can ) they just immediately start nodding their heads and blindly agreeing to anything to give the kids what they want . You can see both the younger Administrator suppressing a smile and laughter at the end at how ridiculous what she's doing is and the older lady ( smiling uncomfortably even more visibly ) puts up her hands like she wants to talk about something ( probably whether or not the "" student's "" concerns matter or not ) but instead she just silences herself and does whatever the student asks . That lack of communication and doing anything to appease these adults as if they're crying children is either what they're trained to do in their jobs or conditioned to do by the culture they feel is surrounding the sociopolitical ideals of the school and / or the country as a whole as the school feels it should relate to . In either case its at the very least negligence and at worst actively appeasing a mentally-ill person in lieu of suitable treatment . Is it up to the school administrators to shred the constitution with you ? I really don't think so . They should discuss why its triggering and if the student is unwilling to discuss that recommend them to a therapist who can because they might have bigger problems . Triggers should be managed and if these are some kind of special triggers that need the rest of the world to appease them then they should rename them rather than trying to define the already well-established terminology of what a psychological trigger is . Its not a school's job to coddle and appease its students more than their parents already have , its their job to challenge them intellectually and manage their concerns regarding schooling . If they have a personal problem , they need to referred to someone then confer with that person as to how the school can work with their issue . A Director of Equal Opportunity shouldn't be bending over backwards for something that's "" triggering "" because its a psychological problem , which is well outside her area of expertise . But the fact they immediately did without hesitation shows there's a sort of unbeatable power behind the word "" triggering "" or "" oppressing "" beyond its original context , at least to Colleges which , for the majority , are undoubtedly far left swinging . Those words don't need conversation , treatment , or analysis they simply mean the person who says them needs appeased rather then treated or questioned or else you are a "" problematic "" or "" oppressive "" person , whether the inspiration for the "" triggering "" or "" oppression "" is real or not . When your job and reputation is on the line you'll become a slave for those words and any explanation given to you , no matter how illogical , you will run with because the endgame is that you're not a problematic or oppressive person . The payoff really isn't that you're a good person , because you could still screw up by having the wrong opinion at any time . But more that you are NOT a problematic or oppressive person and thats enough that you can continue to stay on your toes without getting knocked down . TL ;D R These weren't the right administrators to handle something psychological like something "" triggering "" . The fact that they immediately complied with anything without working through the root of the cause of the "" trigger "" shows the word has unreal and unreasonable power because people don't want labels attached to them that could damage their reputation , earn them viral harassment , and cause them to lose their job . Its at the very least negligence and at worst its actively appeasing a mentally-ill person in lieu of suitable treatment ."	EXP

4303	Christianity	"Question : "" Why pray ? What is the point of prayer when God knows the future and is already in control of everything . If we cannot change God's mind , why should we pray ? "" Answer : For the Christian , praying is like breathing . It is easier to do it than to not do it . We pray for a variety of reasons . For one thing , prayer is a form of serving God ( Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) and obeying Him . We pray because God commands us to pray ( Philippians <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . Prayer is exemplified for us by Christ and the early church ( Mark <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray , we should also . If He needed to pray to remain in the Father ’ s will , how much more do we need to pray ? Another reason to pray is that God intends prayer to be the means of obtaining His solutions in a number of situations . We pray in preparation for major decisions ( Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ); to overcome demonic barriers ( Matthew <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest ( Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ); to gain strenh to overcome temptation ( Matthew <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ); and to obtain the means of strenhening others spiritually ( Ephesians <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . We come to God with our specific requests , and we have God's promise that our prayers are not in vain , even if we do not receive specifically what we asked for ( Matthew <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; Romans <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . He has promised that when we ask for things that are in accordance with His will , He will give us what we ask for ( <NUMBER> John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . Sometimes He delays His answers according to His wisdom and for our benefit . In these situations , we are to be diligent and persistent in prayer ( Matthew <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ; Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . Prayer should not be seen as our means of getting God to do our will on earth , but rather as a means of getting God's will done on earth . God ’ s wisdom far exceeds our own . For situations in which we do not know God's will specifically , prayer is a means of discerning His will . If the Syrian woman with the demon-influenced daughter had not prayed to Christ , her daughter would not have been made whole ( Mark <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ , he would have remained blind ( Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . God has said that we often go without because we do not ask ( James <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ) . In one sense , prayer is like sharing the gospel with people . We do not know who will respond to the message of the gospel until we share it . In the same way , we will never see the results of answered prayer unless we pray . A lack of prayer demonstrates a lack of faith and a lack of trust in God ’ s Word . We pray to demonstrate our faith in God , that He will do as He has promised in His Word and bless our lives abundantly more than we could ask or hope for ( Ephesians <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ) . Prayer is our primary means of seeing God work in others ' lives . Because it is our means of “ plugging into ” God's power , it is our means of defeating Satan and his army that we are powerless to overcome by ourselves . Therefore , may God find us often before His throne , for we have a high priest in heaven who can identify with all that we go through ( Hebrews <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . We have His promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much ( James <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) . May God glorify His name in our lives as we believe in Him enough to come to Him often in prayer .

4374	pokemon	Lawful good - Fighting types . Fight with honor / a sense of duty ; they play ' by the rules ' . There's a reason fighting is super effective against dark ( that is , dark doesn't play by the rules ) . Moves are primarily physical based , which to me implies a sense of doing things the old fashioned way - the one who is the strongest makes the rules . Neutral good - Flying types . They're paired with almost every other type out there , implying they can get along with just about anyone . Resistant to fighting , so if they don't feel like going along with the rules , they can easily fight back . Several legendaries are flying types , so they can act however they wish too , on their own personal level rather than being bound to follow the rules . Chaotic good - Dark types . They play by their rules , not those set by others . Physical attackers , so they don't have to have a plan , just do any move and hope it hits . May not always get along well with the team , but they have their useful place . <NUMBER> Elite Four members use them , but no gym leaders - perhaps giving a sign of their usefulness , but also difficult part of being involved in a team .

Since they aren't super effective against anything , it seems to be that they are just there , trying to make their way in the world . Chaotic neutral - Psychic types .

Can be harnessed to work and follow the rules , but has the ability to lash out and be extremely harmful depending on the situation . Neutral evil - Grass types . Act pretty much in their own interests - while they may not necessarily look for a fight or to harm others , they're not opposed to harming others for their own gain . ( ex : giga drain ) . Chaotic evil - Fire types . If the chaotic evil type is one that has no respect for anything , be it rules , lives , or whatever , I think fire fits the bill . It's out to destroy anything , burning up whatever will help fuel it's rage . There is no desire to help , only the goal to keep feeding itself in order to keep burning .	NOT

4395	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

4410	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

4507	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

4726	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks . Male Hollywood already knows that chick flicks are soul-sucking monstrosities that should be taken out back and shot . Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

4868	milliondollarextreme	"So what youre saying is that i should neither look away nor towards the stimulant , but rather just passively allow visual information in for processing . So if im driving and a i see a girl in yoga pants , i ought not turn away or towards her , and if I do catch a glimpse of her , then i should think of her as a relative or to be aging ? That is what im getting from your reply . Though you do say "" sometimes you have to look "" , so does that mean i should actively look at something stimulating though downright pornographic , like the woman in yoga pants , rather than only passively ? Well a woman in yoga pants is not necessarily pornographic in its own right . Properly speaking , we only wear clothes because our minds are not decent . In a utopian sort of society we could all walk around nude , and we would be less disgusting to look at because we would not be gluttonous , and we would also not have any lust so a beautiful woman would just look beautiful , like a flower . That is almost incomprehensible to our minds in our current state . Where this all takes off is when we are with our wife and everything is channeled through love as opposed to lust , it really causes the heart to explode and elevates your mind to a whole other level . This is ultimately where this is headed . Meanwhile the perverse utilize their mind in the inferior way and it leads down the predictable path . It is interesting to note that they know it is wrong and evil , you constantly see these behaviors being referenced to as evil . There is much evil in the good people and much good in the evil people . But yes , you will kind of get the hang of it , its a little bit of training , but in practice it becomes quite fluid . The difficulty is that you have to actively exercise your attention , and we face many failures as we fall back into subjective and mechanical ways of controlling our attention ( which is always characterized by lust ) . Not everyone can even do what we are talking about here , some people go from the cradle to the grave without ever questioning their impulses , and they are just pawns on the chess board of life . To be fair , i actually did try out the method you mentioned of picturing women as your relatives , and it is genuinely really helpful , it makes me realise how debouched i can be with my lustful thoughts and makes me want to treat women with more respect in my head . I hope that is what i ought to gain from this method anyway . There are a lot more things that can be done . Exercise for example helps transform that energy . Writing , reading and so forth help "" dry out the passions "" , a lot of authors , poets , etc have written on the topic , when you start looking at everything in terms of vice and virtue , you can really see a great battle between authors , it also ties in with ideology . As for pornography having the same effects on you as drugs , i can attest that they really do . They downregulate your neurons so much so that its impossible to feel motivated , stimulated or inspired by anything , to the point where even music isnt fun to listen to . Complete anhedonia . Makes life hardly worth living at that point , at least thats what it feels like in the moment . <URL> Summary_of_addiction-related_plasticity There are good addictions such as exercise and environmental enrichment . Sex in its upright form is also extremely healthy . I dont know what you were referring to when you mentioned mental illness and how nofap can cure it , but if it was with regards to ocd then it wont because its something ive had years before my porn addiction and my mother has it too , so its likely genetic , though it may reduce it effects . But if it was with regards to things like depression then yes you're right , over time that will heal with nofap . Mental illness is a figurative word , really we all have mental illness . This world is an asylum . OCD is just a tendency of imbalance , I have my own particular tendencies . As we become more and more balanced , these become a lot more subtle , but can be more destructive because we have more willpower and intelligence to drive behind them . This is where the saying "" with great power comes great responsibility "" refers to . I still dont quite understand how you can be spiritual without being religious and quite how this applies to nofap and self control , is there any further reading i could do on this matter ? Thanks man Well there definitely is a lot more reading that can be done . Here is a good audio lecture on YouTube that is not too intimidating : <URL> If you felt confident with that , google "" Gnostic Teachings "" , the . org website , which ranges from introductory level to very advanced when diving into all the various angles and rabbit holes . Spirituality is merely just the opposite of materialism . If you are not entirely materialistic then you have some spiritual side to you ."	EXP

Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ? "" Because they've learned to be guarded with guys lest their friendliness be mistaken for attraction . Or maybe this girl is just really open . Or maybe she actually just genuinely likes you as a human being ! You're not her emotional boyfriend ; she's your emotional girlfriend .

And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat ? Actually this is a pretty common misconception . Animals can turn very low nutritional food / waste / food we can't digest into protein . Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food . I'm not really sure where this misconception began . If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return , why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place ? I mean it's kind of like saying "" you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food ? We don't need to be eating plants We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly ! "" ( we can't ) Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals ? And that animals shit constantly , and fart , both of which are problematic ? Not sure why this is a problem . Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants ? Also , shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions . These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product . Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer . You should also probably google "" what it's like in a factory farm . "" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused , mistreated , genetically-modified animals . I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general . None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology .

Islam , of course , has a handful of violent incidents at abortion clinics . But I don't actually think it's fair to compare sexual abuse by Catholic priests to Islamic terrorism , because the child sex abuse was not religiously motivated . Just because a priest does something doesn't make it religiously motivated . Christianity does not call upon its believers to molest children . By contrast , Islam does call upon its believers to wage jihad against the infidels . Islamic extremists are constantly invoking this rationale when they commit acts of terrorism .

5180	politics	"No ... you're confusing the size of the money supply with the ability of the bank to make loans . Fractional reserve banking increases the size of the money supply ( i . e . amount of money in circulation ) but it doesn't let a bank lend out money it doesn't actually have . When we both deposit 200k in bank <NUMBER> , bank <NUMBER> can make a loan of up to $ 200k . Someone comes along and borrows 200k - this person may deposit 50k of that money into bank <NUMBER> , therefore allowing bank <NUMBER> to make out of a loan of $ 50k . This $ <NUMBER> . 4m number ( or whatever it is ) assumes three things , which aren't necessarily true : All loan proceeds are deposited back into bank accounts - which makes no sense , people take loans to buy things like cars and houses and pay off credit cards . In reality the money filters through the economy and may eventually end up at a bank anywhere in the world Any loan proceeds deposited into a bank account must be deposited with the same bank that made the original loan - which probably won't happen , given there are thousands of banks in the US , let alone the world . i . e . if bank <NUMBER> made a loan of 200k , there's no guarantee the 50k deposit would be with bank <NUMBER> , it's more likely to be elsewhere . No reserve ratio There is definitely some element of this happening ( i . e . loan proceeds becoming bank deposits at other banks ) , but the Federal Reserve puts brakes on lending by dictating reserve requirements for banks ( i . e . what fraction of deposits must be held at the Fed , the "" fractional "" in fractional reserve ) . Thus , the $ <NUMBER> . 4m thing never happens - maybe the money supply is inflated to $ 300k or $ 400k depending on reserve requirements , but this is split amongst many banks and potentially countries . Bank <NUMBER> is not going on a crazy lending spree . In economics this whole concept is called the multiplier effect of money . This lending / deposit / lending cycle has increased the size of the money supply , but it hasn't actually let bank <NUMBER> make $ <NUMBER> . 4m in loans . Yes , a bank can monetize future loan cashflows & package this as a securitized bond , and then use the proceeds of this securitized bond to make more loans - that happens all the time with mortgages - but really now , that's far beyond this topic"	NOT

If they were to get onto the front page with that type of view ... the wrong or biased opinion could spread . We know it's not right , but some redditors do not . The downvote button is just showing we don't like their opinion . If we downright hated their opinion we would respond trying to preach the truth , right ? I disagree . A well-thought-out , truthful response contains more information and has a better chance of success in stemming the hate than just a downvote . All a downvote says is "" I don't want people who sort by best to see this post , "" which is a lot shorter and perhaps poorer message than "" I want you to abandon this way of thinking because it is hurtful and / or inaccurate , but I want to be calm , loving and tolerant in my attempts to convince you , "" which can be expressed in a comment reply . Also , in terms of public perception : in the best case scenario , your downvote will prevent people from seeing an intolerant comment , which is good ... with a comment response , however , the best case scenario involves not only transmitting the message seen above and successfully turning the commenter away from hating bronies ( impossible with a downvote alone ) , but also conducting that conversation in public and letting haters and neutrals alike witness your argument and the positive way in which you make it . Best-case scenario ( downvoting ): The comment is hidden from view and no one reads it , preventing the opinion from spreading ... but the original commenter sees their words hidden with no response , and their hate is only reinforced . Best-case scenario ( commenting ): The comment remains in view , creating the possibility of the opinion spreading , but your tolerant and more accurate response is the top reply , letting those who might agree with the original comment read that as well . In addition , the original commenter reads your response and is converted away from hatred , and this takes place in a public forum where it serves as an example to others . Worst-case scenario ( downvoting ): The commentor continues to hate , and their comment remains in plain sight . Worst-case scenario ( responding ): The commentor continues to hate , and their comment remains in plain sight , but so do your tolerant responses , which may still provide an example to others .

5348	collapse	"I don't know if the "" verge of collapse "" is correct . I see a serious decline in living standards . How far this will go is beyond me to be honest , but it feels like a collapse in all we are accustomed to already . I see our country falling into a quasi police state . I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since <NUMBER> has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in <NUMBER> I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then . I didn't like the Patriot Act , but the sunset clause made it ok . I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant . I also understood why President Bush sought to go to Iraq versus waiting for more to come here . He was providing targets for potential terrorist in their sand box so our children could be safe . I didn't like it , but it was a solution I could accept . I moved as far away from the city as possible to avoid anymore planes falling out of the sky and tried to forget about the national nightmare that could have killed most of my family . ( My step dad was supposed to be on guard at the Pentagon , My grandmother and grandfather lived in Somerset with my sister at the time . ) Then I learned about peak oil . I thought , so what we have at least <NUMBER> years left . I explained away any concerns that nagged at me , until suddenly one day ... I think <NUMBER> or so I thought about all of it . I realized this was not the world I grew up in , and due to things beyond my control may never be . I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience . I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain . Then I stopped thinking about the past . I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own . I changed the way I lived . I lowered expenses . I learned to cook and bake . Then I learned to grow a few foods . I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the <NUMBER> dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden . When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food , he changed the old bathroom into a pantry . This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store <NUMBER> months of food for our family . We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country . If not , my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways . We could have kept on doing what we always have . I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad . I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received . I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than <NUMBER> washings . I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline . I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat . If you can ignore all of this , then God Bless you . I can't . For me , the collapse of our living standards has already started ."	NOT

If Paul's policies direct the USA towards a political environment closer to Germany's I'm all for them .	NOT

5680	holocaust	Bigger Issue This , of course , brings us to the bigger issue , which is , how do we know what really happened ? The answer to that question is historical research , but that is precisely what the delict “ holocaust denial ” has been created to prevent . Holocaust denial is another word for Jewish control of discourse , in particular historical discourse , in particular historical discourse about World War II . If a historian publishes something that a powerful Jew , which is to say a Jew with powerful backers , dislikes , that person will be punished . If the person in question lives by writing books , as David Irving once did , the Lipstadt brigade will get him blacklisted in the publishing industry . If the person in question is a professor , the big Jews will try to get him fired , as Deborah Lipstadt herself did in the case of Professor David O ’ Connell . In this instance , Lipstadt failed , but David O ’ Connell ’ s case is not typical in this regard . More typical is the case of Norman Finkelstein , who was fired from his job at DePaul University in Chicago . The fact that Finkelstein was a Jew himself doesn ’ t matter . It ’ s the big Jews , in this case Alan Dershowitz , who decide who is to live and who ’ s to die in academe and publishing . Finkelstein wrote a devastating critique of Dershowitz ’ s book The Case for Israel , and , as a result , Dershowitz set out to destroy Finkelstein ’ s career . It was , in many ways , a typically Jewish response , the academic version of “ You ’ ll never work in this town again . ” What followed was equally Jewish . In fact Finkelstein characterized the dispute as a contest over “ who was the toughest Jew from Borough Park . ” The definitive answer to that question is in : the big Jew from Borough Park is Alan Dershowitz , who got Finkelstein fired with the collaboration of the supine Catholic priest who is president of DePaul University . Among other things , this also shows that a selection process is at work among Jews in academe . Any Jew who goes against the interests of organized Jewry will get destroyed by the ruthless academic enforcer Jews who represent their interests . Most Jews are immune to struggles like this because they fall into the broad , gray middle category of fellow travelers , Jews who go along with the agenda in order to collect big salaries for a cushy job . But there are larger lessons to be learned here . First of all , when if comes to a choice between money and principle , Catholic universities go for the money . Secondly , the fact that academe has become the site of unseemly brawls like this is largely the result of Jewish influence in academe . As Professor Lipstadt made abundantly clear in her talk , the university not the place where the big Jews seek the truth . The university is a place where Jews settle scores . It ’ s where they punish people who threaten the Jewish hegemony over discourse . This should not surprise us . The university is not a Jewish creation . It is a Catholic creation of the Catholic Middle Ages , and so it should not come as a surprise that Jews have all of the difficulties which come with functioning in an alien environment when they are admitted to universities . For over <NUMBER> years , from roughly the beginning of the 13th to the middle of the 19th century , Catholics were involved in the creation and preservation of the university as a place where one engaged in the disinterested pursuit of the truth . This was also the place and period of time during which representational art reached its culmination as well . The link between these phenomena--art and the university as manifestations of the Logos which finds its embodiment in Christ and its cultural expression in Catholicism--is no coincidence . Conversely , the Jewish subversion of academe is similar to the Jewish subversion of the art world , something which occurred during the same period of time and , as Israel Shamir points out in a brilliant article “ A Study of Art , ” in his book , Caballa of Power , for the same reasons . If the culmination of Catholic culture was the creation of the university , the culmination of Jewish culture was capitalism , which , over the course of the latter half of the 20th century in America , gradually devoured the university , by restructuring it according to capitalist , which is to say , Jewish principles , in particular those articulated by Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys , a gang of thugs which rivals Professor Lipstadt in its brutality . The institution of tenure , which was a relic of the Middle Ages , was subverted and then replaced by a system in which Jewish superstar professors like Stanley Fish could earn six figure salaries ( While at UIC , Stanley Fish earned more per annum than the Governor of Illinois ) , while the majority of the teaching was done by wage slave adjuncts . . This is not my opinion ; it is the verdict of Heinrich Graetz , the father of Jewish historiography , who claimed in his magnum opus that the study of the Talmud led to the moral corruption of the Polish Jews : To twist a phrase out of its meaning , to use all the tricks of the clever advocate , to play upon words , and to condemn what they did not know . . . such were the characteristics of the Polish Jew . . . . Honesty and right-thinking he lost as completely as simplicity and truthfulness . He made himself master of all the gymnastics of the Schools and applied them to obtain advantage over any one more cunning than himself . He took delight in cheating and overreaching , which gave him a sort of joy of victory . But his own people he could not treat that way : they were as knowing as he . It was the non-Jew who , to his loss , felt the consequences of the Talmudically trained mind of the Polish Jew . <URL>	EXP

Belgravia Belgravia is to the south-west of Buckingham Palace . It is known for its expensive hotels and is considered by the rich to be a desirable place to live . There are many embassies are in the area . Belgravia is generally quiet and is a great area to walk around and admire the Georgian houses . There are also a number of exclusive shops , restaurants and attractive pubs . Bloomsbury Bloomsbury is London's literary district . This district , a world within itself , is bound roughly by Euston Road to the north , Gower Street to the west , and Clerkenwell to the east . It is , among other things , the academic heart of London . Camden Shoppers and people-watchers flock from far away to crowd the streets and chill out at Camden Market . Good cafes and clubs make Camden much more than a great market area . Canary Wharf , on the Isle of Dogs , is the heart of Docklands . This <NUMBER> - hectare ( <NUMBER> - acre ) site is dominated by a 240m - high ( <NUMBER> - ft . ) tower , which is the tallest building in the United Kingdom , and was designed by César Pelli . The Piazza of the tower is lined with shops and restaurants . Chelsea Once a center of innovation in the 19th century when the area was a veritable Victorian artists ' colony , the Beatles and the Rolling Stones lived in the neighborhood that has since lost in youth culture and settled into a small town atmosphere in the midst of the huge city . Chelsea is famous for the King's Road for the bohemian sixties and punks in the 1970s . It's a wealthy area like Kensinon and Knightsbridge . City of London ( The Square Mile ) The first settlement of Roman conquerors , The City is now the soul of the world's financial markets . Modern structures like the Lloyd's Building may outnumber ancient buildings such as the Bank of England and the Old Bailey but The City also holds the sacred St . Paul's Cathedral , Old Spitalfields Market , and Leadenhall Market and the modern Museum of London and Barbican Centre . Clerkenwell This neighborhood , north and a bit west of the City , was the site of London's first hospital and is the home of several early churches . St . Bartholomew-the-Great , built in <NUMBER> , still stands as London's oldest church and the best example of large-scale Norman building in the city . In the 18th century , Clerkenwell declined into a muck-filled cattle yard , home to cheap gin distilleries . During a 19th - century revival , John Stuart Mill's London Patriotic Club moved here in <NUMBER> , and William Morris's socialist press called Clerkenwell home in the 1890s - - Lenin worked here editing Iskra . The neighborhood again fell into disrepair but has recently been reinvented by the moneyed and groovy . A handful of hot restaurants and clubs have sprung up , and art galleries line St . John's Square and the border of Clerkenwell Green . Lest you think the whole area has become trendy , know that trucks still rumble into Smithfield Market throughout the night , unloading thousands of beef carcasses . Covent Garden Covent Garden's Piazza has daily open-air entertainment . The 18th century iron and glass fruit and vegetable market has gracefully evolved into fashion boutiques and other up-market stores . Stroll down Long Acre , Floral Street and the cobbled Neal Street or visit the Royal Opera House . Neal's Yard is the center for healthy food and alternative therapies . Docklands In <NUMBER> , in the most ambitious scheme of its kind in Europe , the London Docklands Development Corporation ( LDDC ) was formed to redevelop Wapping , the Isle of Dogs , the Royal Docks , and Surrey Docks . The area is bordered roughly by Tower Bridge to the west and London City Airport and the Royal Docks to the east . The East End Traditionally , this was one of London's poorest districts , nearly bombed out of existence during World War II . The East End extends east from the City Walls , encompassing Stepney , Bow , Poplar , West Ham , Canning Town , and other districts . These days , many immigrants to London make their homes in the East End . London is pushing eastward . Today you'll find lots of trendy bars , clubs , restaurants , and boutiques or vintage clothing outlets here . Much of the fashionable life is found around Hoxton Square and its peripheries , such as Shoreditch and the northern half of Brick Lane . There is an array of contemporary galleries in the area . Attractions you may want to visit if you're in the area include St . Clement Danes church , the Temple of Mithras , and Sir Christopher Wren's Monument to the Great Fire of <NUMBER> . Greenwich Known by most as the center of Greenwich Mean Time at zero degrees longitude , come visit the National Maritime Museum , the imposing Old Royal Naval College , Cutty Sark , and Greenwich Park . Hampstead Thick with literary history , you'll find homes of poets , playwrights and actors of past and present marked by endless blue plaques ( to show where someone famous once lived ) . Spend an afternoon in Kenwood House or wake a stroll on Hampstead Heath to feel like you're worlds away from the hustle and bustle of London . Holborn The old borough of Holborn ( Ho-burn ) , which abuts the City southeast of Bloomsbury , encompasses the heart of legal London - - this is where you'll find the city's barristers , solicitors , and law clerks . Islinon This corner of North London has ' Upper Street ' - a long road of boutique stores and numerous restaurants and bars . There's also Camden Passage antique shops near Angel tube . Kensinon Kensinon is a fashionable residential area on the south side of Kensinon Gardens and Kensinon Palace . There are still enough attractions to support a good selection of hotels , pubs , B & Bs , cafes , and restaurants . South Kensinon has the ' Big Three ' museums : V & A , Natural History Museum and the Science Museum . King's Cross Long a seedy area in the heart of London , King's Cross is facing a massive regeneration program . Millions of pounds are going into its decaying infrastructure . The area is still far from chic , but was given renewed importance with the arrival of Eurostar , the Channel Tunnel Rail Link coming into St . Pancras instead of Waterloo . Because of this change in venue , it's estimated that some <NUMBER> million passengers will pass through King's Cross annually . Six tubes now convene underneath King's Cross Station , and it is the number-one connection hub enabling visitors to get to and from Gatwick and Heathrow airports . Knightsbridge One of the priciest and most exclusive areas in London known for upscale shops and restaurants . The stores are luxurious and the homes extravagant so walking through this area is a pleasure . Spend a couple hours exploring Harrods and then stop into one of the many restaurants or cafes to relax your sore feet . Mayfair The most upscale neighborhood in central London , Mayfair is home to elegant hotels for affluent foreigners and many impressive 18th century residences for people of fabulous wealth , plus the US Embassy in London . Discover first-class shopping at exclusive shops along Bond Street . Notting Hill Come explore the retro shops , cafe life , designer boutiques , and antique stalls of Portobello Road Market . The year-round spot where the young , artsy folks live and hang out , and if you're here in August , this hip district is taken over by the world famous Notting Hill Carnival which brings a Caribbean flavor to the streets . Soho Soho fuses the trendy and grungy to create a hip neighborhood that lives a vibrant double life . Still a Red Light district , it also provides a respectable drinking and dining area . Soho is a confusing grid of streets crammed with restaurants . It's a great place to visit , but you probably won't want to stay here South Bank Just across from Westminster , don't miss the London Eye ( a gigantic wheel offering unrivaled views of the city ) and the newly-refurbished Royal Festival Hall which is part of the South Bank Centre . See the skateboarders under the Royal Festival Hall and visit the South Bank Book Market under Waterloo Bridge . Loads of free entertainment every summer : music , theater and performances . Southwark Shakespeare still appears at the famous Globe Theatre while Tate Modern boasts a shining cultural program . Stroll the riverside to Lambeth Palace , the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury or pay homage to cricket at the Oval . Westminster The British Empire , and once the world , was ruled from Whitehall . Royalty , government , and monumental London come together in the shadows of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament . Walk near the Kings and Queens buried in Westminster Abbey and take your own quiet stroll through St . James's Park and Green Park . Westminster also encompasses Victoria , an area that takes its name from bustling Victoria Station , "" the gateway to the Continent . "" Many B & Bs and hotels have sprouted up here because of the neighborhood's proximity to the rail station . Victoria is cheap and convenient if you don't mind the noise and crowds . Welfare recipients occupy many hotels along Belgrave Road . If you've arrived without a hotel reservation , you'll find the pickings better on the streets off Belgrave Road ."	NOT

And attaching a bipod to carbines listed above is just retarded since it takes <NUMBER> bullets to kill on longer ranges ( something that I'd never understand ) . Even if you tried to attach a heavy barrel next to foregrip to these carbines , you'll just have to resort to your pistol in CQB as an engineer which shouldn't be happening . Alan Kertz will kill any run & gun play there is on close quarters with these changes and everybody will have to use low horizontal recoil weapons if they want to do so like m416 , m16 , m4 with either a suppressor or laser without foregrip . Suggested changes will basically make everyone start using the same weapons without foregrips or bipod then he'll come back here and bitch about everyone using the same <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> weapons as Assault and Engineer and not attaching a bipod or foregrip . He'll probably keep continuing by nerfing those since they'll all be overused by then . Making foregrip reduce horizontal recoil by <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> deg on all weapons gotta be the worst idea this guy ever suggested . My bet is that it'll be in the next patch since he's basically screwing the game over and over again every patch .	NOT

When people take their assumptions to be self-evident or obvious , it is difficult ( perhaps impossible ) for them to entertain new ideas that are based on a different set of assumptions . If you're going to start taking words seriously and not making them do all kinds of "" double duty "" , you're talking ... well , is it philosophy ? The more I get into political debates , the more I begin to appreciate the importance of ensuring that both parties agree on the meanings of the words they use . Similarly , as I indicated in the original post , as I notice words performing this "" double duty , "" I begin to find the [ Sapir-Whorf hypothesis ] ( <URL> to be more believable and more disturbing .

6032	atheism	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following : The training and certification that teachers go through . Thereby , the recommended teaching methods . The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability . A broad control over what gets taught , in the form of a curriculum . A teacher's conduct , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would you like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in general are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

You got Mao at the other side and Hitler at the other end . The goal both of the left and right movement is to maintain a political balance that serves the people . And if countries will not place restrictions on hate speech , how do you want it to pan out ? For these hateful idealogies to thrive and succeed ? Is that we want , for second wave of Nazi and communist ideals to succeed and infect the succeeding generations ? They are not just ideals . They are hate groups who promote hatred and hostility towards other designated sector of the society . Sure , neo nazis still exist , but with continued resistance from moderates and anti fascists , they are limited and driven underground . I don't know what liberty was taken last week that you're talking about , obviously the government let the white supremacists to hold their rally , and people faced them .

It's his job to properly assess any hit / play that results in someone getting hurt or had the potential to do so . There is way too much disagreement over what the punishments should be for every individual hit , and he faces a ton of scorn for every injury that occurs because of the division of opinion on the consequences .

In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts .

The right to leave , disband or revoke rules of a society should exist , because the right to make rules by majority should exist . Its only if you argue that the only legitimate rules are those unanimously agreed ( likely zero rules ) that children should not be bound by them upon reaching the age of emancipation .

Anyone who cannot manage basic , kindergarten-level kindness is not being a real partner to you , and you leave . I had trouble with the same thing you did : if he treated me so well right at the beginning , why couldn't we just go back to that ? Honestly , I never figured out why he thought it was okay to bait me with kindness and romance and then treat me poorly . But with time , I realized that his behavior would never make sense to me , because I want the people I date to feel good .

6788	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage .

He tried going to the club , and tried gay dating apps for three years , and it never worked for him . Gay "" dating "" apps like Grindr aren't for dating : they're for hooking up . And there's a hookup culture at gay clubs as well . Even with a good , warm personality , and good looks , you're most likely not going to be finding a nice , loving relationship in those venues . It ’ s more often about seeing who you can have sex with , having sex , then seeing who else you can have sex with : objectification . When this story first broke , I almost immediately thought “ internalized homophobia . ” But as this story unfolds , I see someone who can ’ t reconcile his strict upbringing , with actual gay dating , or gay hookup culture . Everyone seemed to be having fun at the gay club and meeting each other — except for him . Every time he went , hundreds of shirtless men were laughing , dancing , grinding , yet he sat in the corner due to poor socialization , and his inability to adapt , and drank . This massacre could be an instance of homophobia . It could be that he was angry that no one in the gay community liked him or wanted to date him because he couldn ’ t adapt to how to behave around , or converse with other gays effectively . He went to the club dozens of times , saw men objectifying each other , and perhaps became disillusioned and angry . Where was his love ? If he began to see the gay men as just objects , it would be easier to shoot them up . In his mind , if he ’ s a person , but no gay men ever liked him , they ’ re not people .

I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste .

I have a hard time understanding why someone would be upset with something , or why people say something like , "" You have nice eyes "" as a compliment . These things don't make sense to me ... but I am human and want to interact with humans so I try to learn about how normal people work . This ends up with me always asking , "" What is the motive behind this ? "" or "" What prompted this ? "" I guess that's how I came to this conclusion . I saw all these photos that , on their face , look very strange . Why would a person pose with bread ? I also try to find patterns , and the pictures all have a few things in common : <NUMBER> . There is one human in the photo , and only one . <NUMBER> . The person is never smiling or making interesting faces for the camera . <NUMBER> . The person is obese , and many photos involve food . Could these have anything to do with the overall theme ? In my head , they do . Now maybe the photographer was high as fuck and there is no inherent meaning in the pictures , but as far as I can tell they all speak of the life and mindset of an obese person .

You act like the US should be greatful they have a country like Israel they're forced to give expensive military equipment to for free , which Israel then sells to the Chinese and continues to build illegal settlements despite promising the US not to . you pay them huge money for oil they pump out of their ground for free Are you delusional ? Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money . Man the Israel propaganda machine has done a real number on you . But yeah israel is all mean to people that are shooting rockets at their cities day in day out and who send suicidebombers to blow up their kids , how uncivilized to not simply be happy about that right ? And they killed jesus right ? but you are just being reasonable right ? right ... We're not talking about any of that , we're talking about how the US is Israels bitch :) Besides , Israels terrorist activities , numerous crimes against humanity , and general constant dickishness does not go away because of what someone else did . I'll let you have the last word , I'm not going to reply anymore to someone so stupid who thinks that pumping oil out of the ground is free or that Saudi Arabia paying for US aircraft is the same thing as the US giving Israel aircraft for free .

His brother M , who is a good friend of mine , is fit and hot . These people all are part of the same group , along with a hand full of other fit or skinny more or less attractive people . D makes a point to get in everyone's business , throw fits , steals food , and generally acts like a giant entitled , alcoholic toddler . He has to be THE LIFE OF THE PARTY and center of attention . He is convinced his rather short , almost spherical body is big and strong and manly because he used to do some martial arts years and years ago . He thinks he is a suave stud , a genius , and legit acts like some red-pill negging art of seduction tard . He clings / mooches on my brother so that he can flash around our family name ( virtually a house hold name in the metroplex / state we live in ) for some semblance of status and so that my brother will buy him stuff and let him use our guns / vehicles / land / food / ranch . He does the same clingy moochy bullshit to The Ex so he can get a share of the lime light , fuck the frustrated groupies ( The Ex is apparently not over me , and quite picky ) , and act all important "" riding his coattails "" as it were . They both put up with him because he fronts like he's their good friend and flatters their vanitys while actually being a back stabbing jerk . My ex also has depression bipolar disorder leading to an over indulgence problem with alcohol / substances which D intentionally makes worse so that The Ex will still hang around him . He doesn't drive ( too many tickets for speeding and unsafe driving ) and expects everyone to cater to his whims . He makes mean jokes and picks on others all he time , but gets really fucking butt hurt if anyone retaliates , then acts like a middle school girl to get back at you . If he isnt getting female attention ( usually doesnt happen until late in the night when everyone is shwasted ) he goes around butting in and cockblocking and telling embarrassing stories about his friends and generally being a nuisance . He constantly brags about all the tail he pulls , but I know for a fact that , in all reality , he uses his non threatening appearance to get girls to trust him ( similar to The Gay Best Friend ) . He then gets them stupid drunk and basically date rapes them . Usually they can't get past third base because its to hard what with juggling a near passed out chick , his giant gut , and that he is also very drunk . He attempted to rape my best friend last year . He was drunk as fuck while we were all partying for his birthday . He wanted birthday sex . My best friend was quite inexperienced with guys at the time , was shy and reserved . They were flirting a bit and fooled around but nothing serious ( M was driving at the time and I was in shotgun . ) When everyone went into the bar , D convinced my friend to stay outside and then tried to rape her . I happened to go out or a smoke at just the right time and put a stop to it . It devolved into a whole messy situation that I'm too lazy to type out right now but ended in me LITERALLY fighting D off my friend multiple times in the bar parking lot while we waited for our ride and then as we were walking to their car . He didn't want her to leave , and couldnt understand why my bestie wasnt interested in a stud like him . He excused his actions by , i shit you not , saying "" b-b-but it's my birthday "" with this look of utter confusion on his face . To this day he acts like nothing happened ."	EXP

7560	uncensorednews	"You can't just pick and choose what you believe in . I make assumptions based on history , check them against reality and adjust whatever I read . Which includes stats . Since I know the US government is desperate to paint whites as bad and non-whites as good I know they'll do sneaky stuff like Where'd you get that ratio ? Can you provide a link please ? It's an estimate based on the FBI states and adjusted for behavior . How can you say that hate crime against blacks is justifiable ? I'm saying that the majority of supposed hate crimes against blacks aren't actual hate crimes but self defense , revenge or that sort of thing . Whereas a ton of black crime against whites are hate crimes but not classified as such , because the authorities will only do so if there's absolutely incontrovertible evidence racial hatred was the motive . Recall that white kid got tortured by chimps screaming fuck whites ? They tried at first to claim it wasn't a hate crime and then it was a hate crime against the handicapped . That's likely typical . Was Dylan Roof justified in murdering those innocent black families that were simply attending church ? Since those black families likely defends and aids the sort of monkey I linked to torturing an old lady I don't have all that much sympathy for them . By your logic , hate crime against whites is much more justifiable because blacks have suffered so much more over the years . The primary cause of black suffering is black dysfunction . That is , they victimize each other and themselves with their stupidity and impulsivity . Just because something is seen more often on the media ( which isn't true ) doesn't mean it's real , there are many crimes committed that aren't recorded so don't think that just because you see more black violence online it means that's how it is irl . That's my point . White crimes is overrepresented by a factor of <NUMBER> in media reporting and black crime massively under reported . Compare Omar Thornton and Dylann Roof and how much coverage each got . You should've learned to not believe everything you see on the internet , it caters to what you want to see . Trust me , I don't want to see white people getting tortured . Where'd you get that it takes <NUMBER> white families to support one black family ? That's the ratio of the tax surplus generated by whites and the tax drain generated by blacks . On average whites net contribute something like $ 100k over a life time and blacks net consume something like $ 500k . Link ? And you do realize that not all black people live on welfare ? There are many well self supporting black families , just as there are many white families on welfare as well . Pretty sure most blacks actually do get welfare . And of those that do have jobs a huge percentage wouldn't have gotten them except for legally mandated discrimination in their favor . That is , they're not real jobs but wealth transfers from whites in exchange for them doing subpar job or simply pretending to be working . Even though this country's history has a trend of trying their hardest to make black peoples ' lives difficult . If that were true there wouldn't exist any blacks in the US . There have been people who truly felt that way . Which is way there are no blacks in Arab countries , despite Arabs taking far more black slaves than whites ever did . The difference is the Arabs castrated their slaves and killed them as soon as they weren't useful , whereas whites helped their slaves and cared for them . Like I said , if whites had merely left American blacks to fend for themselves , rather than supporting them through welfare and that sort of thing , <NUMBER> % of them would starve to death . I'm not saying that the kkk go around murdering people , as far as we know , but it's disgusting that they are still around because of the values that that group was built on The KKK was founded to protect Southern whites against Northern and black violence during reconstruction . That's a noble and good thing . The Dylan Roof shooting was not a huge thing because it was "" rare "" , it was huge because he killed many innocent people , including a pastor and state senator . Simply not true . Omar Thornton killed about as many . But all that happened was that the media tried to paint his victims as racists who had it coming and then dropped the whole thing . FFS a year or two ago a black guy murdered a white reporter and her cameraman on live television and the story was buried .

Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy .

During her chemo and radiation , she had lost so much weight , was sick as a dog - and he'd be screaming at her to hurry up and stop puking because he needed his breakfast . This was the reason we relocated home from living abroad - I had heard what he was doing from family members and I could hear it on the phone when I talked to her . So I immediately came over and played "" blocker "" and assumed the food slave role - so she could have relief . He didn't care WHO was serving him , just as long as he was being served .

8107	hockey	"I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement : "" In short , it is illegeal specifically ... "" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said : <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted . However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it . I worded it poorly in my initial post , but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as "" Dirty "" when I didn't feel it was dirty ."

8310	uncensorednews	"We have a fundamental difference of how we see Trump and what is of most importance to the US right now . What no addressing of the media bias ? Firstly , the media is very far from perfect and I don't deny that . All <NUMBER> - hour news channels are packed with schlocky bullshit . But just because there is a lot of negative press about Trump doesn't mean it's unwarranted . Trump's entire life appears to be extremely combative . He seems to thrive on it , no ? That's not media bias , that's me observing the man over a period of years . Do you have Twitter ? You know that phrase "" You reap what you sow ? "" He has sown more than his fair share of derisiveness . Combine that with his lack of experience in public service , it's not surprising that most news outlets did not portray him favorably . Deflections ? I addressed everything stated quite clearly . You make empty excuses like "" he's changed "" and "" As for the Mexican judge issue , it depends on the character of the judge himself ( whom I know nothing about so can't comment on ) . "" He said the guy couldn't judge him fairly because of his race . That is textbook racism . You're not "" addressing things quite clearly "" but rather making weak excuses for Trump's racism . The Central Park <NUMBER> : "" arguing about it in hindsight when it turned out those confessions were either coerced or to reduce their own punishments is hardly fair . "" Like , do you really think taking out ads in the NYT calling for the execution of teens is a normal thing to do ? And you're talking about hardly fair to judge Trump for this ? That's a fucking joke . This is what I mean when I say you glide over blatantly racist shit . I think you're being flat out disingenuous about Trump's role in Birtherism . And yes , many people view trying to delegitimize our first black president by saying he was born in Africa as racist . Womens rights over there body ? Not a fan of the childs rights I take it ? I'm a fan of women having children when it is right for them , and for providing safe methods for terminating pregnancies up to a certain point . I don't believe a fetus is a child . A group of cells is not a child . I believe the health and livelihood of the mother is more important than those things , and I respect the opinion of the many millions of women who desire the right to choose . Not being a woman and never having to carry a child , I don't feel it is right for me to make this decision for them ( by voting in politicians who will take their choice away ) . This will be a point of difference for a lot of people , and I understand that . Abortion is a complex issue where I see people's reasoning on both sides . But at the end of the day , birth control ( male / female ) is not perfect and abortions will likely occur one way or another . I support providing safe havens for those that seek it . Not trying to presume , but I think we both agree that there are certain circumstances where it is appropriate ( health risks to baby and / or mother , and instances of rape or incest ) . I don't think we should limit access to those services by defunding PP and making abortions illegal . When you say things like "" Planned parenthood is a corrupt organisation "" I think you are partaking in the same sensationalist bullshit that you don't like in regards to Trump . Planned Parenthood provides free or affordable health care to those in need , cancer screenings , birth control and education , the value of which truly cannot be understated . The best way to avoid abortions is to provide access to cheap birth control and reproductive education . Plus , providing these services actually saves money in the long run : <URL> Obama care was a joke system I don't think there are many people that are out here clamoring for it to stay exactly the same . Maybe with even the smallest amount of Republican support , we could have made it work . But the GOP was dead set on opposition . I say fix the ACA , don't just repeal it . And if they are serious about a replacement plan , why don't they tell us what it is already ? It's not as if this wasn't a talked about issue . Considering people's lives are on the line , I'd say it's pretty important and something that should have been laid out pre-election . I don't believe you truly read the leaks at all honestly I have not read them all , I admit that freely , but I have read through some at various points in the last few months and some from the link you sent . There are illegal and corrupt things going on , I agree . Sadly that is the dark truth of politics today and throughout much of human history . It's something myself and probably most Americans have known , but felt powerless to change . Before you say Trump is that change : The Intelligence Community stated there was Russian interference in our election . You can call that BS if you want , but the power of the Wikileaks revelations is tainted by the obvious attempt to sway this election for Trump . And with his murky financials and refusal to release his taxes , it makes you wonder who is working for who ? As far as I know , Wikileaks had info on Trump but it "" wasn't interesting . "" Why don't they let us decide ? Why do they put out massive dumps of all DNC leaks , much of which is banal , but don't give us an opportunity to see the totally innocuous info on Trump ? It doesn't take a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist to see there are forces at work trying to influence our interpretation of Hillary PURELY for the purpose of benefitting Trump and putting him in power . This , along with Republicans complete refusal to acknowledge this fact is just as fucked to me as anything I've read so far in Wikileaks . You're a good writer and a great deal more thought provoking than other Trump supporters I've talked to . I very much appreciate skepticism and I hope you will apply the same level of skepticism to the Trump administration ."	EXP

8328	uncensorednews	"Well hello , yet again , / u / p220 [ <NUMBER> ] . If you feel overwhelmed , perhaps it's due to the reality that there are an overwhelming number of ways to argue against Islam . Not feeling overwhelmed at all would just love to keep the conversation on point instead of a big copy and paste of prepared polemics arguing your "" side "" , as opposed to an intellectual , substantive debate where both sides listen to each other and speak on a particular subject without worrying about "" what side "" should win . Thank you for your concern though . The best thing that would help me would be to keep the conversation on a single topic , otherwise , it's not as productive . Would it make sense if I pasted a bunch of pro-islam websites instead of doing the hard work of typing out my own responses on the topic ? Or attacked your character as opposed to speaking generally to the topic ? The number of Muslim friends to which I could introduce you is probably greater than the number of Muslim friends to which you could introduce me well then I guess we'll have to stick to the subject matter , like Quran and Hadeeth instead of "" I talk to muslims all the time and they're like totally misogynist ! "" anecdotes . Unless you want to talk about muslims today vis-a-vis Islam as opposed to Islam itself as enshrined in the historical record and the corpus of key religious texts . You mean bias like when someone replies repeatedly whilst coyly attempting to obscure the reality that in their so-called "" reply "" they have completely avoided addressing any of the points which were previously brought up ? You're right , that is rather transparent . No offense . I apologize . Which point did I miss ? You pasted a huge wall of text , and I assume it was not some kind of prepared argument and you really typed that all out , so I apologize for not going through it thoroughly . Let me correct this issue now in good faith , which point would you like me to address ? How is this a problem ? ( for the record , that was a rhetorical question ; as you're clearly incapable of addressing points , please don't reply as I won't read it-no offense . This reply is entirely for the entertainment of the casual bystander who happens down this tabbit hole of a comment thread ) . If someone has a pulse , and believes in something , they will pick a side which makes sense to them . I'll reiterate - picking sides isn't a problem , letting your side endanger your impartiality and neutrality that can become an issue . I . e . when your agenda trumps the facts For example , you are clearly very biased negatively towards Islam . Whereas I am not prosyletising , rather speaking to the facts ( if not , I would love to be corrected ) . It is only natural that those who are not neutral would copy the view of the extremist . It makes for a convenient way to malign the target . WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN BRO ? That was not very clear , my point was , if one "" side "" wants to malign the "" other "" , one great technique is to make a "" straw man "" out of the other side . <URL> Have you considered the possibility that to achieve anything worthwhile in life , one must pick a direction and cease to be neutral ? I believe I addressed this when I previously said : "" This is something we all do in varying degrees of course ; it is impossible and undesirable to avoid bias completely . However it is much another thing to be able to recognize one's own bias and not be controlled by it . That is where most people fail . "" One should actually choose a direction and not let the direction choose for them . "" The blind lead the blind . "" But not you , amirite ? No . Everyone makes mistakes . Some people cover it up , some people are honest about it . The latter is a key component of wisdom , in my view . If you don't make these kind of mistakes , you have no need to be defensive ."	EXP

8581	OperationPullRyan	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section <NUMBER> ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section <NUMBER> renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year <NUMBER> to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section <NUMBER> modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section <NUMBER> , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section <NUMBER> requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section <NUMBER> before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section <NUMBER> could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section <NUMBER> requires the President to submit a report to the Congress <NUMBER> days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section <NUMBER> further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section <NUMBER> , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

If I were able to actually extract it all and put it on one place ... it's be this massive mess of shit . Overwhelmingly uncompleted . Hell , even full songs , things I called complete , I've ended up trashing and deciding I want no part of anymore . And , if I were to go as far back to all the stuff I wrote in my teenage years , dear god ... It's all part of being an artist . I think one of the biggest traps I've found myself in as a songwriter is occasionally getting too focused on something . Thinking I have to use something in a certain way , it really limits me . Getting so married to an idea that I can't be free to change it ( potentially making it better ) or look past it enough to add to it really cripples me .

8823	milliondollarextreme	Trump ’ s election is certainly not isolable to the wall promise , much like Hillary ’ s loss isn ’ t isolable to Wikileaks or American chauvinism .

You should drop the idea that there is anything but brands and atomized identities in America . Addidas holds more people together than old values like imperial prestige or small-government agrarian libertarianism - if you disagree with this , youre just slow , or havent understood the events of the post-ww <NUMBER> social changes . Token desperate identification with these older values means exactly that they no longer exist or else theyd need no advocacy . Divorce lawyers and decreasing real wages are common objects but ideas about what America is about aren ’ t . If you think there is a common political culture , what holds the midwest to Michigan ? Or the rust belt to the South , or any of those regions to the west coast or the south west ? You say - a common reaction against attack . But with the decline of the old religious , chauvinist , filial order , and especially with the end of the illusion of the American dream ( except for those in main line WASP exurbs of cities ) , nobody has a unifying solution . Redpills want to go back , and blue to go forwards , each for their own sake as such with the inanity that comes with desiring something for its own sake . You are right that nations are poor for lack of interest from the market , but increasing globalization and cheapening labor have pushed the market into places it has never been before . The Middle East has seen billionaires born overnight from oil and it has destroyed their traditionalism - just look at Mecca today and the reactionary ISIS as a hyperaccelerated version of what has played out across the West .

I'm going to answer "" Why should we all play along with trans people ? "" Being transgender is a medical condition which can be diagnosed based on a set of symptoms . Over the years , we've tried many different things to alleviate those symptoms ; including electroshock therapy , conversion therapy ( positive reinforcement of birth gender ) , supplementing testosterone for transgender women ( male to female people ) , and plain ol ' classic denial . After literally decades , the medical community decided "" What if we try letting them be who they say they are ? "" and noted that , for those who are able to be treated normally as their identified gender ( so , for a male to female transgender person , this would mean treating them as a woman ) their quality of life improved - - not cured necessarily , but improved . Flash forward a few years and we have the technology to increase the likelihood that these people are treated normally by society ( by things like hormone replacement therapy and surgery ) and quality of life of transgender people can still be seen to improve . Again , not perfectly , but there's marked improvement . This is all fine and dandy for those transgender people who do fit in , but what of those that do not ? Unfortunately , there's not a magic pill which can make any person "" fit "" into what society says a man or a woman should look like , and for those people , relief from their symptoms is hard to come by . So , we ask that all of us have compassion for these people , imagine ourselves in their shoes , and treat them with the decency and respect that we would treat anyone else . - note : fine and dandy doesn't mean there are no problems left . A transgender person's own body tends to deeply distress them , and that isn't something we can really cure - - we can do a lot , but things like the suicide rate and general outlook on life won't reach normal levels until our technology increases even further . I'm stating this before someone links that one swedish study everyone loves to cite to show surgery doesn't work . :) Hope my input was interesting , I think I've rambled long enough ."	IMP

8919	Music	I remember always liking Jimi Hendrix , and alwasy hearing he was the best , a super psychadelic monster that was invincible , and I believed it to some degree , but I guess I had just never totally understood the utter reverence that so many people had for him . One day , I met up with some friends at the beach who were all tripping , and one of them casually asks if I want to as well . It was a beautiful sunny day on the San Juans in Washinon , on a rocky coast with seals dipping in and out , and starfish everywhere . I decided to do it . Well , after spending some time with them , the sun started to go down , and they all began to head on , but I realized my trip was just beginning . I made my way home alone , decided to play some music as the trip took hold and thus began my moment with Jimi . I made my way slowly into my friend's room , which was still somewhat dark . I could hear things crawling and creaking on my peripherals , my vision swam with color and things gently breathed all around me . I sat down the couch and saw my roomie's guitar hooked up to the amp . I grabbed it , and in so doing touched his computer which had been left on . Immediately , a Jimi Hendrix playlist that he had been jamming along with began to play , the guitar already set in tune , with perfect crunch . I looked up , and lo and behold the moonlight had begun streaming through a window covered by a cloth wall hanging of Jimi hendrix himself . His lines , his rhythms , his playing suddenly all made totaly sense to me . He weaves this incredible psychadelic pattern that is amazing colorful and delicate . You can hear two or even three gutair parts weaving in and out of his playing effortlessly while he plays . It drives itself directly to your core , and explodes with joy and light . I don't know how long I was there playing with Jimi , but I'll never forget it , it really opened my eyes to what Psychadelic music really was , and the power music can have over a person who has a gift like that . Luckily , there are MANY wonderful musicians with that gift .	NOT

It's basically a rite of passage for Western men , just like eye-raping women on the street and clubbing baby seals ( which is actually okay , because veganism is classist ) / sarcasm EDIT TO ADD : In response to a question about what she thinks of the fact that women post pictures to their blogs that sexually objectify men , she says : by its very definition , women cannot objectify men on the basis of their gender Looking past the fact that parsing that sentence is impossible , it's fascinating to learn that the mere act of sexual objectification belongs to the realm of male privilege .

9231	uncensorednews	I read that whole comment ( that you just copy pasta ’ d from the wiki article ... and not once did you give an example of an Islamic country that was trying ( on their own ) to establish a democracy but was prevented by the West . That wiki link gives tons of examples of the US helping to create authoritarian governments to secure their own interests ( something we all already know and everyone acknowledges this ) ... But not once did you give an example of an Islamic country where the US helped to overthrow a government that was trying to become a democracy . All the authoritarian leaders it helped put in place ... not one of those countries was trying to become a democracy before the US intervened , which was the entire point I was making by asking you for examples . Yes the US and the West has helped to destabilize the region ... Yes , the US helped put in place dictators and authoritarian regimes to secure their interests ... but none of those places were trying to become a democracy . The reason I point this out ... is because democratic secular values are pretty incompatible with fundamentalist Islam . The only times any Islamic countries in the Middle East have tried to create a democratic government , is after the US intervened and tried to help set it up . Which is why your statement of .. knowingly hindering any attempts at democracy ... is false . Those countries weren ’ t attempting to establish a democracy before we came along . Hell , it even talks about it some in the article you linked . From the 1980s onwards , after the Iranian Revolution , the United States government began to fear that its interests would be threatened by the increasingly popular Islamist movements in the Middle East , and began to work to secure cooperative authoritarian regimes in the region , They weren ’ t popular secular , Democratic movements ... they were popular Islamist movements ... and we all know what happens when these fundamentalist Islamic movements take control of a country ... Just look at Iran now compared to how they used to be before the Iranian revolution , ... before fundamentalist Islam took hold . See ... this is the point I was trying to make ... and instead of replying to the specific question I asked ... you sent me this irrelevant comment from Wikipedia that actually helped prove my point in a way . You people have this idea of the entire Middle East trying to become a developed , civilized society with Democracy and Western values ... and then the big bad United States came along and fucked it all up .. But that couldn ’ t be further from the truth ... if anything , without Western involvement , the Middle East would have been taken over by popular Islamist movements even quicker ... The truth is ... the Middle East has been a shithole for centuries , ever since their beloved warlord prophet Muhammad went around raping , pillaging and conquering the entire region over a thousand years ago . If you want to know the real reason the Middle East hasn ’ t developed at the same pace as Western civilization ... it ’ s because every attempt to secularize has been smacked down by Islamic fanatics .

9238	fatpeoplehate	"I'm not ignoring the squat booty , I did forget to mention that , though , because it obviously alters size . Thank you for saying that . However , we're not talking about weightlifting altering your waist size , we're talking about height . My argument , however , is not bullshit and I'm sorry if it offended you as such . I'm not basing it on bullshit either . I'm basing it on two things - - my careers . First of which was fashion modeling . A career , as I've said before elsewhere , literally built on the backs of tall women in sample sizes . And my current career , which I am working on a PhD in , is the study of bioarchaeology / osteology . Human skeletal remains . I know bones . Frame size does not vary all that much within one sex . Bodybuilding can build thicker bones , yes , but it's that huge muscle growth that's gripping the bone that's going to make a difference in your size . Your example has little to do with height . Your height does not change the density of your bones . This woman has a wide pelvic cage . Her iliums likely flare out much more than average . She is unusual . That can happen on a slender short woman , it is independent of height . My reasoning stands . The average woman , built with a normal frame , who doesn't lift heavy , tall or short , is getting fat at a US size <NUMBER> . Are there outliers ? Yes , there's always outliers . And if you're a <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> "" + woman , your entire body existence is an outlier . People my height are unusual enough . By that height , you're the size of a large male , and all clothing size bets are off for a woman . Frame width definitely adjusts at that large . But again , we're talking serious outliers here . When most people say tall women , they're usually talking about <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> ' . Edit : I just wanted to add for .. I don't know , interesting informational purposes . It's not that we can't and don't measure frame size . That's part of the process of every skeletal analysis I do . And anyone ( human sized ) can measure their wrists and get an idea of their basic frame type . But we're still taking minute differences . Just because you and the person next to you measure small and large frame sizes respectively doesn't directly mean you're going to be wearing hugely different clothing sizes . Bone thickness can tell us a lot of things , depending on how thick it is and where it's thick , about how a person lived . It's very useful in archaeological studies , generally for determining the most common activities someone did , and what sort of health issues may have plagued them ."	EXP

The part that pisses me off the most is the fact that other people encourage behaviours like this lest they feel bad about shaming fat people . Shaming fat people probably won't make them lose weight but its a hell of a lot better then encouraging this behaviour and saying it's ok to be obese .

9374	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up .

9534	fatpeoplehate	"I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with a ham and I will try to explain the circumstances that brought me there in order to help you get through to your sister . I was emotionally beaten down by life at the time . I was a teenager , had an abusive dad and a very unhealthy home life which I felt I was uneffected by ( looking back this was inaccurate . ) My dad was a shitlord , but also abusive and my impression of his personality was very negative . I wanted to be all that he wasn't so accepting others regardless of appearance or status was very important to me at that time . When I met the ham I was blind to fitness level thanks to my accept everyone disposition . I'd always been "" nerdy "" and not great at sports and I think that influenced my leniency on fitness . I'd also just broken up with my boyfriend because he had totally bailed on plans we made to go away for some time in the summer because he was afraid to leave home and I was pretty much disgusted by the lack of balls . So when I met the ham out on my adventure he immediately had points because he was at least there and seemed confident . Turns out he lied about a lot of things and was able to convince me that he was independent , health oriented and a peaceful open minded person . I was under the impression that he had good qualities and that we were similar in our world view . ( Nit at all . ) At first he was very nice to me , then he iced me out , which made me feel insecure and like I'd done something wrong ( a common pattern with emotionally abusive people . ) So this friendship continued this way for a few years and when I graduated high school I moved away to college . That's when he changed the way he acted toward me big time . He started harassing me with calls and texts all the time , constantly needing attention and expressing undying love for me . I found it really weird and annoying . My problem is that I'm too polite about boundaries . I tried to tell him nicely that I didn't want a close relationship like he was pushing for and he would cry , whine and generally beg me not to stop speaking to him . I felt bad so I entertained his texts and calls for a long long time . He got offended that I had boyfriends . He would criticize them , me , my clothes , my food choices , my personality , so many things . And still I didn't hold him accountable . Then I lost a parent to a preventable disease . As I worked through my grief he was even more obsessive , domineering , and passive aggressive . Suddenly everything clicked , hard . I realized he was a disgusting glutton and a bully . I realized that I was accepting that type of behavior in my life and made a change immediately . I cut him out and I laid down my rules very firmly . This was about <NUMBER> years ago . We have contact still and he tries to pull the same whiny bullshit but it doesn't affect me anymore . I feel no sympathy or guilt . I realize that his problems are his own and I need to do what's healthiest for me . It took me getting free of my abuser and learning to truly love myself in the aftermath to overcome my codependency issues . I was being emotionally manipulated and it is possible your sister is too . Talk to her . Ask her what she likes about him . For me it was that we talked about everything ( we were unhealthily close ) and he was kind to me ( when it didn't entail any true effort on his part of course . ) But something changed in me and made me see that the way he treats himself and me were not healthy . If someone can't love and care for themselves they certainly can't do it in a relationship . She needs to figure this out . Whether it's through you , or her own experiences it is important you support her as an individual . Make sure she's still taking "" me time "" to develop her own character and sense of self . I suspect this is a self esteem issue . She doesn't realize that she deserves better . She should be with someone who cares for themselves and is capable of being caring toward another person .. sometimes you learn that from other relationships , and sometimes you have to teach yourself . FPH helped me stay strong . If and when she breaks up with him be sure to show her this sub . It's a great reminder of their behavior and tactics being unacceptable . I feel sooo much better now that I've removed toxicity from my life . She will get there if you talk to her about it !"	EXP

9700	uncensorednews	"Is the Obama administration willing to pay the price of increased gun control ? It's a price paid in lives , though judging from its treatment of its consulates and its drone strikes , this administration cares little for blood spilled - American or foreign . If you don't think there is such a price , you need only look to the City of Light . Paris , where possession of any firearm is illegal , has suffered not just one , but two separate terrorist shootings in the previous year . These two massacres , one with over double the deaths than this tragedy in Orlando , prove conclusively a need for citizens otherwise hapless to have means to defend themselves . Clearly , as we see in all of these shootings , the police do not respond quick enough to the scene to eliminate the threat . Fighting "" gun violence "" in the United States not only moves us closer into the realm of a police state , where citizens are barred from the ownership of guns , monitored on the Internet and on their phones and all other communications , but it also ignores the true motive behind this attack - radical Islamic terror . It is high time , in my opinion , that the moderate Muslims start policing their religion and the radicals of their faith , just as Christians oft do - that is , if they truly are the "" overwhelming "" majority . Take a stand beyond strongly-worded speeches and letter of condolences . Reform your faith , if you wish to keep it from prejudice ."	IMP

From a slightly different perspective , a teacher teaches techniques for solving the problems that are on the exams .

I would really only specifically state the method to use when I taught two methods that could both be used to solve the problem .

Somewhat related , I remember giving my students a choice between exams with "" show your work "" problems and multiple choice questions . At first , they were very excited about multiple choice .

There comes a period where you're telling a generation of whites that blacks can't be judged for their current ( and historical ) criminal behavior for outrageous reasons where they simply say no more and stop buying the bullshit . It is interesting you bring up the Rodney King incident when blacks , yet again , rioted like animals . Attacking and killing whites indiscriminately to prove a point , the point being that they will chimp out at the drop of a hat .

Marxist dynamics require opressor / opressed . Problem is that Socialism / communism was originally based off liberating people from class opression , poor peasants overthrowing the rich bourgeois . But they had a problem in that in the US , with hard work and discipline you could work your way up in society . There was nothing they could offer for liberation , because people could liberate themselves . - - - Then one of Marx's more radical offshoots and a sexual deviant came up with an idea .

RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , <NUMBER> , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

10058	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

10066	fatpeoplehate	They kind of do , in a situation where for example you had a wounded normal individual as well as a wounded ham in a burning building , if neither can help themselves I believe most would automatically opt to helping the normal person as opposed to the ham because there just is a greater chance of survival for the rescuer and the normal individual .

They loved pulling off all limbs and heads , and re-attaching them to different bodies . I still have a full Lego storage box . The ones that got stepped on or ended up in the vacuum and taken away .

10452	sjwhate	"You're correct there probably is no point . I re-read your post and you started out saying that you want to be just like Milo so you can spread your own propaganda rather than "" investigating "" the truth like an actual journalist would do . He's the largest figure in modern day right-wingery only to children like you , he doesn't exist outside of reddit and r / The_Douchebag circle-jerk . That's not "" jouralism "" it's info-tainment , and at that point you're the one who's off topic because you're posting about being worried about getting a real job because you secretly want to be a conservative puppet which is the opposite of actual reporting . If you want to go beat off to the idea that all foreigners / muslims hate gay people , while simultaneously telling me that conservatives seriously support gays when your poster girl Kim Davis sits in jail because she won't even follow "" The Law "" , go ahead , but don't think you're fixing anything by joining the problem , or refusing to accept the fact that republicans have been the source of the problem that created a need for the people who flock to a bullshit feminist movement to right the wrongs they put in place over the last <NUMBER> years . The only reason Milo can exist today is because someone who'd you probably call an SJW in the <NUMBER> ' s or <NUMBER> ' s stood up for the rights of someone like him to be allowed to do whatever the fuck it is you think he does today . As if Ragen was calling AIDS a gay disease in <NUMBER> and then decided to bring them into his cabinet in <NUMBER> . It didn't work that way , and the fact that you don't have a problem with gays isn't due to some divine miracle , it's because a lot of people had to fight to put anti-discrimination laws in place to make sure it doesn't happen . You keep telling me that "" not all conservatives are religious , anti-science , blah blah blah "" , but then lump anyone who's for human rights as a SJW . If you don't want me to make your party out to be an anti-science , fundamentalist group of retards you should take your own advice and stop thinking that Liberals are the source of SJW bullshit . It's the same type of donors that fund the likes of Palin and Bachman that fund an Obama or a Hillery , but it's not the law that you're even pissed about . We're pissed because all this shit gets taken too far . There's a huge push back now to bring back free speech , but there's a difference fighting the problem and countering the bullshit with bigger bullshit . SJW's need to be called on their logical fallacies . As for why you'd ever consider taking an immigrant from one of those countries ; have you ever heard of Bill Maher ? He brings people on his show from those countries who want to get rid of those governments . You bring in people from those countries to save them from those countries . A gay person get's thrown off a build in Syria and you don't think that person wouldn't rather come here and live their life freely ? That they love the government that allows that to happen ? You're saying a <NUMBER> % of all the people that hit the ground from their <NUMBER> story drop thought , "" well this sucks but at least I'm not in America "" ? You bring them here so they become an advocate for your way of life and show the world it's possible to change it . That's why he brings them on his show , and that's how you make a change . Like the one that benefited fuck-face Milo's existence . Again , you're right , if you want to be a fanboy for the ones who have been destroying the world one piece at a time , such that they created the fucking SJW movement in the first place .. knock yourself out . I'd rather fix the problem . Good luck with your info-tainment career . BTW , I highly recommend you watch some George Carlin , or Bill Hicks , if for nothing else than to understand what the past was like - because just claiming that "" everything's fine now , gays and blacks aren't an issue "" because you weren't alive or paying attention to the thing's that happened before ... isn't a valid excuse to get your points across ."

10536	europeannationalism	"Thanks for sharing . I don't have the time to address everything you wrote so I've selected a few paragraphs that stood out to me . Here's what I think IS real : European history and culture is rich , varied , powerful , beautiful , sadistic , noble , messy , free-thinking , oppressive , liberating . It's all of the above . Whiteness intersects and intertwines with that cultural timeline , meaning different things to different people in different eras , and though I'm sure we could argue that forever , that's not really what you're interested in . Your idea of "" whiteness "" is the one seen through the lens of modernity , standing in contrast to Africans , West Asians , East Asians , Middle-Easterners , Pacific Islanders , etc . , sometimes including Hispanics , sometimes not , sometimes including Jews , sometimes not . But even with that messy definition , I believe there is still enough of a cultural identity that can be discussed . and traitorous strategies are heavily disadvantaged when compared to both ethnocentrism and humanitarianism . Neither race nor cultural separation are required for groups of humans to attack one another , and the more you seek to separate yourselves , the more likely it is your children will inherit those divisions and fight among themselves . Even if you limit European history to just the "" white "" portions , there was plenty of suffering . Racial purity scapegoats the underlying psychological flaws we ALL share as a species , and even if Hitler had his way and the world was repopulated solely by beautiful white babies ... do you really think that will prevent conflict and in-fighting even a hundred years later ? Humans will gladly invent differences out of thin air to justify otherization and violence . Of course we can never completely eliminate violence and suffering . Surely we should at least attempt to minimise conflict , though ; I see no better way of doing that than separating the races into homogeneous groups , letting in-group preferences play out in a semi-productive way and reaping the benefits of a relatively high trust society where everyone is "" like me "" with a shared purpose and goals . Forcing lots of racial groups together is a recipe for disaster because it results in low trust societies with constant tension and jockeying for power ( i . e . social dysfunction ) above and beyond the individualistic conflict that exists in homogeneous racial groups . If you're interested , you can also have a quick look at some of the links in the sidebar listed under "" Diversity and ethnocentrism facts "" to get a better idea of what I'm talking about ."	EXP

As a consequence , history had to be rewritten to omit any negative mention on anyone who might "" belong "" to the "" Jewish people "" , biographers had to distort their own works to omit any criticism to the "" Jewish people "" made by the biographed person , and any direct criticism at any belief or tenet of Judaism had to be partially rewritten , so that the reader is led to believe that the criticism is aimed towards Christianity , Islam or "" religion in general "" ( example : criticism on circumcision of infant males aims the highlight on some Protestant branch of Christianity , instead of aiming the hightlight towards Judaism ); Likewise , any negative criticism about anyone or any family / group with a "" Jewish seal "" , from the past or the present , is branded as a "" conspiracy theory "" , and anyone who dares to open his / her mouth about them is branded as a "" conspiracy theorist "" and he / she is officially / unofficially punished by the estabilishment and by anyone who fears it ; In the crazy aftermath of WW2 , the artificial "" Jewish people "" was able to persuade all the emergent world powers ( USA , UK , and USSR ) to give to them the infamous "" Promised Land "" , which led to the creation of the artificial "" Jewish State "" of Israel , with its semi-artificial "" Hebrew Language "" , founded on the principles of religious homogenity and a semi-racial homogenity , and they all agreed with the idea of gradually kicking out the native population that occupied the land "" belonged "" to Israel that did not pass the "" Jewish "" filter , a process that has been happening since its foundations , and will happen until the whole of "" Palestine "" is absorbed into Israel and its non-jewish populations are kicked ."

The Christian afterlife and the Jewish afterlife are entirely different . Why can't we go back to this system , which is our very own ?

I don't think you could put together a team of historians and have them conduct a perfectly-executed sacrifice , nor would we know how to take the auspices ( which themselves would be necessary to figure out if the day is propitious to sacrifice ) .

10886	fatpeoplehate	Nature won't stop obesity , only a global education intervention and food reform will . Natural selection is the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring . Natural selection is dead in modern humans due to the infrastructure and support systems we have in place . If you're sick we have doctors , surgeons , and medicine . If you're disabled or handicapped we have technology that allows one to live their lives closer to the norm . If you're poor you're provided free health care and food through welfare . We've extended the life expectancy of our species by making it damn hard for someone to die . Despite being unattractive , fat people will still always get fucked . You have the desperate , ugly , socially inept , and / or fat that simply can't do better . Fat people may want someone skinny and attractive but excluding finding a skinny chubby chaser , they will realize their place and eventually settle with someone who doesn't contrast their size and start a family . Obesity reduces life expectancy but not to the point where they won't reach an age where they can't produce offspring . Obese people tend to be poor and less educated . The poor and less educated tend to produce more offspring and have their children sooner in life . In that sense they are technically beating educated / skinny people on the natural selection front since they are living long enough to produce a greater quantity of offspring . Couple that with a lower life expectancy , the parents will die off at younger ages leaving their children with less education and resources to better their positions in life . Now their's stupid poor fat children that will grow up and repeat the cycle . HAES will eventually kill it self off and their supporters will turn on it the same way smokers did . The main figureheads might be healthy now , but in a few years / decades they will be in the ground . The ones that replace them will be in ground . The notion of HAES will be buried with them as they see their idols and role models dying at early ages . Those that were a part of the movement against movement will speak out in their dying years just like the Marlboro man realizing the error of their ways . This will only quell the uproar we're hearing from the loud fats currently , but it doesn't stop the problem . We haven't eradicated smoking , just lessened the impact , just stopped people from saying that it's not not healthy . There's millions of nonvocal fatties that aren't with the HAES movement but just can't be normal weight because they lack the willpower to be normal size or simply don't care . They sit in their car to get to work , they sit in their office at work , they sit in their car to get back home , and sit in their home watching tv all the while stuffing their face all day . They are addicts and food is their drug . Without proper education starting early in their lives and making unhealthy food more expensive harder to get , fatties will continue to be fat .

I'm not blind to the fact that they are reporting his profession because it constructs a narrative , but if people are only willing to care or read if the man has a prestigious job title , that's a problem with the people and not the media . I know it's basically the premise of this sub , but some people can go a little overboard with accusing media of extreme bias when they don't report everything in the driest least assertive way possible .

My bf's sedentary TDEE is <NUMBER> ( <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> "" , 135lbs ) just to sit on his ass and play Monster Hunter all day . Mine , on the other hand , is <NUMBER> . Means he can be a lot more thoughtless about what he eats than I do .

In fact , I'd say it's a bit easier for men because they CAN work for it , whereas genetics for tits , a nice face , a nice figure , etc , can't really be fucked with . Some women are skinny and boyish looking and there isn't shit they could do about the width of their pelvis to shoulders . Some women are just hourglass shapes and scored all sevens on the roulette of genes ( but then might have an ear-grating voice and one tit is noticeably bigger than the other and her vag is an outtie that makes both lesbians and straight men recoil in horror to ruin the package and she will be totally shit on for ruining the ' perfect package ' in the same way an incredibly tiny dick would for men ) .

Not shit a girl who is a 30AAA with no ass and a ruler shape can do to make men salivate over her , except the tiny minority of guys who like that type of figure . My preference in men is rather androgynous , anyway , so I realise I'm a minority . I don't know what appeals to women and I won't really pretend I do .

First , Tribalat expressed her regrets "" not to have the population figures of persons of foreign origin for two generations "" . But , she said , it is not so difficult to compile it one's self . "" If we add the two generations ( immigrants and children of immigrants ) , this gives a total of <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million , or <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % of the population . Thus , we have slightly more than one inhabitant out of five of foreign origin , across two generations , in <NUMBER> "" . Asked by Gatestone how she came to the <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million figure , she replied : "" Very simple . I added the <NUMBER> migrant population ( <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million ) to the Insee's <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million children of immigrants , and it came to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million . "" In her Atlántico article , Tribalat maintains that more important than the <NUMBER> data picture , is the growth-rate that led to the <NUMBER> figure . Tribalat calculated her own estimates of this growth , with starting points in the years <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> , coming up with figures of a stunningly fast growth for the number of migrants over two generations : the <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million migrants of <NUMBER> ( <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % ; <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> that are "" missing "" are from French overseas territories ) , were <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million four years earlier and <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> million in <NUMBER> . In other words , <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % in <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % in <NUMBER> . The population of French persons of foreign origin would therefore have increased , when looking at two generations , by <NUMBER> % between <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> alone.nFor the same period , French children born in France to parents born in France increased by only <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> % , writes Tribalat . Consequently , France's population is increasing significantly only because of immigration . But which immigration ? Christian or Muslim ? Tribalat continues : "" I showed that the annual average rate of increase of immigrants was almost zero between <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> . But it is not the same story from <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . ... The population of sub-Saharan origin is the one that grows more quickly . In four years ( <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ) , looking at two-generations ( immigrants and children of immigrants ) , the sub-Saharan population seems to have increased by <NUMBER> % . This population is extremely young . In <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> % of the children of sub-Saharan immigrants are under <NUMBER> years of age "" . These conclusions are confirmed by another Insee study , "" Demography of the descendants of immigrants "" ( Démographie des descendants d'immigrés ) , published in <NUMBER> . "" The Turkish and sub-Saharan African population is growing at an extremely rapid rate ( which could lead to a doubling in less than <NUMBER> years if this continues ) ... The total fertility rate of women born in Turkey is approximately <NUMBER> , as it is for women born in sub-Saharan Africa . It is closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> for women born in North Africa , while it is only <NUMBER> for women born in Europe , especially in France . "" In other words , if the Muslim population of France can be estimated at around <NUMBER> million today , it could grow to <NUMBER> million by <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This figure does even not take into consideration the Muslim population that immigrated to France from North Africa in the 1960s and early 1970s . There are a few million of them - - nobody knows how many exactly .

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

11823	fatpeoplehate	"I work with kids , and some of the problems I see as a teacher's aide ( USA state funded before and after school care ) are that kids aren't getting educated in how much they should eat , and of what things . Hell when I was in school it it wasn't even taught how much you should eat of what , yes the food pyramid was gone over , but nothing about Cals in Cals out what is an actual healthy meal . Granted I am in my <NUMBER> ' s so fat when I was in school was the kid who was like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> pounds over weight not <NUMBER> . I don't think we'll see programs like this in the US , not because of feelings , well in some communities it could be because of feelings . I'm looking at you home town ... ( some place in Nor Cal ) But also because of the way schools are funded in the USA , if you look at what programs tend to get cut first during a budget crisis , it's always arts , fitness , and recess . Instead of having a few less admin or secretaries ... But if you look at how much time kids actually get outside and get running at the elementary school level it's really sad , it ends up being less then 25mins total for a <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hour day . The rest of the time they are behind their desks , and forced to focus , not only does this create problems in terms of them actually learning and being able to focus , it also leads to a lot of the childhood weight problems we are seeing . Some studies and teachers also point to this as a rise in the amount of ADD they are seeing . Now while I believe that ADD is real , as someone who works with kids , I can also see how over diagnosed it is . Because of the lack of physical activity the kids get now , also the kind of activity they can get . A lot of schools have banned games like kick ball , or tag , because kids could fall and get hurt . So they end up being expected to even play quietly when out side . Now if you live in a high income area , you don't have much to worry about , because in the US schools are funded by property tax . So a kid in the school district for the upper Haight probably isn't going to have to worry about PE or Sports being cut , in the way that kid in the district covered by the Tenderloin is . A lot of things are going into Childhood obesity and it's something that makes me fucking sad , at the k - <NUMBER> level because at that age range you don't have much control over your life and what you eat , and if you aren't getting the education on how to fuel your body and take care of it , then how are you going to know later on ? I have no sympathy for adult fatties , because they can talk to their doctors , they can use the google and things like MFP , and know how to learn things . I really think it comes down to schools giving kids enough activities and education on their bodies to end this problem , but it's not just a matter of hurting peoples feelings it's a matter of having the money to provide that education . Most teachers end up spending about <NUMBER> dollars a year of their own money to keep their class rooms going . The way we teach kids about food needs to change , and there also needs to be a change in the attitude held by parents where they just scream "" THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY DARLING I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU . "" That so many parents have today . Parents can decide not to vaccinate , parents can say no I don't want you to hold my baby back a grade even if they can't read , parents can decide if they want there kid to be fat ... this is the attitude that needs to change ."

It was obvious that she had lost a ton of weight and only looked decent with her clothes on but like a loose sack of shit with her clothes off . Pushing through through the awkwardness I decided to give it the ole ' college try . I started to go through with it and got down to business . I went to get a mouth full of nipple and sucked just a little . It's breast had next to no elasticity and buckled like a plastic bag full of water and went straight down my throat . I instantly started gagging and stopped immediately . She started asking what was wrong as I started gathering my shit and her concern turned to anger as I explained why I was leaving . I was depressed and disgusted for like three days later . Long hot showers and reflecting on my life decisions lasted for weeks until I met a tight little brown haired German chic that rivaled me at the gym .	EXP

12211	sjwhate	"So much of this has to do with people being insecure in themselves and wanting to be different and unique . They dye their hair funny colours , get extreme and aggressively out of the norm hair styles , lots of piercings and tattoos . I bet it starts like "" i need attention , I'll dye my hair , oh and I've gained some weight but a new age haircut will make people less on that . Oh and well all my friends have nose rings and piercings so i should do that . I'm also vegan and gluten free now . Meat is murder . Occupy Wall Street Black lives matter , and White people are literal hooman filth because I'm feeling guilty about what my ancestors did even though I'm so far removed from them that i would be OK with blacks enslaving me for a while as compensation . Oh look a new trend of being transgendered is cool so I'm transgendered i suppose and how dare you insult my rights . Being "" fat "" is just as healthy as being skinny stop fat shaming and mansplaining you cis scum . Dude most of those people looked attractive and very normal at first . It's incredible how low self esteem / need for validation will take you to such extremes . This is how you get SJW's , neo nazis , hell , even drug addicts . You're not born with a needle in your hand or a pink undercut . You surround yourself with these people and after enough time the constantly being around it normalizes it all and you join slowly but surely . With enough pressure and enough time just about anyone will become any one of these labels that are floating out there . It's a self feeding cycle . Who can be more extreme than then precessor . We see it often with religion as well . For example in Judaism you can't have milk and meat when the Bible says no calf in its mother's milk because that's a shitty thing to do so be cool guys . Then someone was like , well that means any beef with any milk . Then someone is like no way its all meat with any dairy producing animal . Then someone is like yo even though chickens don't make milk you can't have chicken with milk because it's now meat and you can't have meat with milk . We went from don't be cruel to don't eat milk with meat all because every important Jewish figure along the way decided to be more extreme with their rules than the previous person . We see the same thing happening with feminism . At first it was a movement to give women an equal playing field . Now it turned into bringing down the white man . They actually hate on white ( usually middle or higher class ) people for the color of their skin ( but let's be real it's often about being male and / or wealthy ) which by definition is racism but turns out you cannot be racist against white people . Any person hating a type of people based on their skin or culture heritage is racism . If you hate Jim from the office because he's a cunt , that's a different story but you don't hate him because he's a white guy , that's racism . The point is though , feminism was a great concept at first . Get women treated better , equal pay and benefits , etc . Then it turned into , well men have ruled the world for two millennia so it's our turn and let's take some power , and then all of it and tell them everything is their fault while simultaneously doing things that are just as bad as what they did , or even doing things we are criticising white men of doing . Eventually feminism turned into a gender study somehow and merged with LGBT issues , normalizing it all which is great , if you're gay and born that way , whatever dude glad you can get married and that you're happy , we are all people together . But then it turned into a cool thing to be bisexual or transgendered and people are deciding that they are so deeply gay that they need to be the other sex . I absolutely think many people are actually trans , being very feminine boy or masculine girl since childhood or being born with unidentifiable gender , etc . But a large part of LGBT is that a regular joe shmoe ​ surrounds himself neo feminists and the LGBT crowd because they are nice and fun to be around at first and after enough time , he loses the rest of his friends and only has these type of friends and they say being LGBT is the only acceptable way to be a man anymore , otherwise you're guilty of what your ancestors did but if your LGBT your not part of the problem anymore you're the victim So you somehow swing the LGBT thing and grow to like it and it spirals out of control and soon enough you're on hormones . None of this is meant to say that lots or most LGBT people are not genuinely gay / trans / whatever , or that all feminists are bad , I'm just saying that's it's very easy to indoctrinate people when you successfully shove your mantra down their throats on the daily basis . That's how we got Nazi Germany , and that's how we got <NUMBER> USA ."	EXP

It's the same thing as a pic like [ this ] ( <URL> That picture is funny not because of any underlying racism towards Asians , but simply because the kid and the cat do look alike . I don't think it's inherently racist to liken a black person to a monkey , as long as the reason for doing so is not the person's race . Because of a history of prejudice towards blacks , this can be a tricky subject . But I do think the only way to put racism behind us is to stop dwelling on it .	NOT

12409	uncensorednews	And I'm not even sure how you can say Democrats took Republican ideals and their version of conservatism I didn't . What are you referring to ? The borders and immigration policy ? You sound like a Democratic these days - - government intervention to fix things and keep them fair ? LOL . I think your brain is on the fritz with this . There is such a thing as too much intervention and I think your looking at it from a one or the other and no middle ground in terms of intervention . No to unnecessary regulations , yes to protecting American businesses especially small businesses . For example , the vaping industry ( the nicotine kind not the marijuana kind ) which is a fledgling industry being lumped with the tobacco corporations . One business , Provari and I think they were the only one that took the risk to make hardware in the USA , had to close due to FDA regulations and associated costs . They had to compete with chinese made vaping hardware which sold at more than competitive price . Only big tobacco which has their own vaping cigarette product lines was able to front the money . The GOP is so waist-deep in free market ideology that any regulation is overreach , from the EPA to consumers ' relations to more . Not sure if you've been paying close attention to the GOP over the past <NUMBER> years ... I honestly don't think you do . And with all your talk of capitalism , let foreign goods come in . It will make domestic markets react and make the proper adjustments accordingly . Free trade and all that good stuff . Which is perfectly fine when others play by the same rules , but how the hell can you compete when your intellectual property is stolen , made for cheaper and maybe not the same quality , and start flooding the market complete with a similar logo / name on it ? Product that you spent money researching and having to deal with regulations that constrict small businesses . Sometimes they don't even meet the same standards American businesses must adhere to for their product resulting in faulty knock offs . Large corporations aren't that vulnerable but an owners small business is . Not to mention <NUMBER> % of the other stuff I mentioned , like Social Security , labor laws , unions , and infrastructure that past Republican leaders have pushed which are abhorrent to a very solid chunk of the Republican party now . Some things are just good bipartisan things to have and then sometimes a good thing gets abused and no longer works . Social Security looked good in order to take care of senior citizens , but there has been some doubt in the past whether it is sustainable . Not to mention that whole large scale screw up at Experian that resulted in SSN's being stolen and now people are wondering if it should be replaced . Not sure which labor laws your referring to . Unions have been disliked and liked from both political parties , depends on the union . Republicans won't like an infrastructure plan that results in the government being the main employer , it's reminiscent of socialism and communism .

13442	uncensorednews	"Besides a lot of states have various amnesty programs - giving undocumented immigrants social security numbers and drivers licenses . I'd hardly call that ' fleeing from justice ' . No , I'd call that a crime . Sanctuary states should be stripped of federal funding until they're no longer willing to flaunt their deliberately breaking immigration law and get with the program . If we're talking Mexicans in the US , the majority of the drugs and crime and human trafficking is related to drug cartels . I wish we'd legalize drugs in the USA if only to cut off their source of funding . You know what else cuts that off ? A bigass wall . They depend on the foot traffic of illegals to cover their movement . If that goes , so do they and so does the human trafficking . This brings up a very important point : if the Mexican immigrants are supposedly causing so much economic and social and criminal damage to the country , $ <NUMBER> billion to be rid of those problems should be a pretty good deal . We can get the job done for far less , and we wouldn't have to pay people who broke our laws to pretty please leave . That's weakness on a national level , from which we would not recover . Like I said , I'd much rather pay OUR citizens to get rid of them . I think you greatly underestimate how much hatred and recrimination that sort of policy would bring to the USA , not to mention crime from Mexicans having to go underground and losing any access to honest jobs . They don't do honest jobs in the first place . They are literally illegal labor , one and all . And I genuinely do not care about "" recrimination "" . If they get mad about us enforcing our laws that they chose to flaunt , well , that's their problem . I truly don't care what a pack of criminals who leech on my society think . I just want them gone . It is long past due that they stopped being our problem . But I think it's a bit extreme to say that sort of thing is going to happen ...

13453	fatpeoplehate	I like a story that someone shared once . The basic idea was similar to the sixth sense , where the creepy kid saw fat people , instead of dead people .

Since I like science fiction and fantasy , I want a story where there is a cosmic / supernatural event that suddenly destroys people's perception / awareness of their own obesity . As these skinny people are walking around , they are starting to notice bad things happening to them . They break chairs , they get stuck in narrow places , etc . The humor would be in the way the world cannot accommodate their expanding hammyness . In the end , they will have to face the fatlogic they have used and repent . Some will hit the gym while others will kill themselves . I like your idea OP , but I dislike stories that become too involved with politics . Utopian and dystopian futures are kinda boring because they have been done too many times .

The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists . At least I haven't noticed a problem yet . But even when driving I like Seattle drivers .

When insurance providers can't turn down people who are prone to various illnesses due to living a horrible lifestyle , insurance premiums are going to skyrocket for people who actually take care of themselves .

Server-side software tends to be better about support , in my experience .

So ability to pronounce words you weren't familiar with , as well as the ability to define them was counted in ) .

However , while there is the testing of certain cognitive abilities , some of the stuff like mathematics and language skills are fairly relative to your previous knowledge . I'd also like to point out that each problem was given a score and you would receive a total score , then would have it divided by your age . I'm sure we can all assess that someone like Abe Lincoln wasn't exactly stupid . However , with an IQ test testing against knowledge to some degree , Abe Lincoln would surely be hurt in his scores .

She posted photos in a general-interest , public area . The negative comments surrounding it were posted in a niche-interest , more concealed area .

You ask questions you know the answer to , and you watch the eyes . Eyes tend to move when a person is thinking . The basic idea is that when a person retrieves a memory , their eyes will instinctively dart either left or right . When they make something up , they look to the opposite direction . With a few easy questions , you can interpret when the interviewee is retrieving a memory , or making a new one . Once you call them out on a few lies , they will give up trying to fool you . Lying is hard work , telling the truth is way easier , and even liberating . Every time I ever extracted a confession , the person was always relieved to be done with the lying .	EXP

V . or media in any way denouncing violence Not true , you just made up shit to appease your own view of the world . You have people anywhere from Ben Carson to President Obama talk about issues in black communities , BLM all the time . [ not ] doing anything to really strenhen race relations in this country So what do you want them to do ? Let's see where the rest of your rant goes Kids like the black students screaming at their professor at Yale or these idiots at a Milo event or these wonderful Dartmouth kids or the countless other examples of this deplorable behavior , are the reason shit like this is going down in America today . Nice strawmanning . I could pull videos out of my ass of whites , conservatives , old people doing something stupid or nefarious .. will that advance my argument ? No . Learn to think . Race relations are degenerating and quickly , and the black community is more pissed off than they were in the 80s when there was such violence and such despair during the drug trade . I don't know if that about the 80s is true , but I agree things have gotten worse . But then these middle class blacks started going to University , being told by not only their black professors , but their white professors , that the system has been putting them down , and they believed it . So long as you refuse to understand what white privilege means and that it exists , you'll never get what that means . Whenever one tries to explain people like you , you just close up your mind and mutter "" muh sjws "" to no end . To make it as simple as possible : Black people - higher chance of being born in ghettos - lower chance of pulling forward . Black Lives Matter is the misguided Kylo Ren of the world , not realizing their battle has already been won . There is still traces of institutional racism left over , not to mention classical instances ( i . e . the KKK and such groups ) . However those are not as powerful as the poverty trap they encounter themselves in . But what's happened since the Civil Rights movement ? Black communities are worse than ever . Not even remotely true and you know it . The black graduation high school rate is horrendous , black on black crime is an enormous issue , blacks are responsible for more than half of the murders in the U . S . , the single motherhood rate in the black community is something like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % Yes , that happens to people living in poverty traps . these kids have the balls to [ blame ] black the whites of the United states Blame goes to racism , not whites . We all know that classical and institutional racism is not as much of a problem as it was decades ago . We've slowly seeing improvements . You may have the occasional police officer not doing what's best , but that's not the point . The point is that blacks still continue to live in poverty and you can only blame the racial disparity on our history . They're where they are because of the sins of our ancestors . You have CNN selectively editing these idiots and showing it to their audience at dinner time , trying to convince people that there are crusaders out there against the riots - - when in reality all they can find are more blacks inciting violence . You have blacks calling for whites to get beat up and CSU offering segregated dorms to combat micro-aggression from white students . I mean - - the list goes on and on and on . These are just ones I've come up with off the top of my head that are fresh in my mind . But where are the prominent blacks speaking out ? Where are the Martin Luther Kings ? The closest things we have are guys like this who try to talk some sense into people , and what happens when he sits down with the president of the NAACP chapter in Compton and a "" preacher ? "" She calls him an Uncle Tom , white , an Oreo ... More strawmanning . Again , want me to pull out videos of whites inciting violence ? What would that prove ? Nothing , just like you proved nothing . You wanna prove African Americans are mostly violent ? Pull out some statistics . Learn to think . INB <NUMBER> you pull out crime statistics . Now we literally have blacks blocking streets , trashing neighborhoods , beating up white people , kidnapping and torturing people , and NO ONE WILL SAY ANYTHING . This is the same shit as what's going on with Muslims in Sweden and Germany , and what is it going to take for us to get real with each other ? Oh cool , can I use the Dylan Roof example to prove that ALL whites are RACISTS , DEPLORABLES ? Also nice of you to compare blacks in the US to Muslim foreigners in Europe - complete racist , inexcusable garbage . Don't worry though , that only proves you are racist , not your entire demographic . No one will say anything until there is literally a race war in the streets . There wont be . Your fantasies aren't reality . And where are the sports stars speaking out ? Where are the black entertainers speaking out ? I know you think very highly of celebrities but these aren't the people blacks look up to . They look up to President Obama and such , they love him and are extraordinarily proud of him ( sometimes to a fault , I admit ) The support for these Black Lives Matter terrorists from the Left and the SJWs and mainstream media is only adding fuel to the fire . Oh lawd . Protests and obscure Tumblr blogs history of institutionalized racism . If you care about any of this shit , arm yourself with some statistics like the ones I linked above TIL youtube videos = statistics The black community may need help . Let's elect a retarded President and have him stack his cabinet with donors , globalists and Goldman Sachs executives , that will help . Urban areas are shit right now , but that doesn't change the fact that there is a culture issue Urban issues , ghettos are the cause of the culture issues . If we reject globalists policies we will get closer to solving the issue but it might not be enough . But again , that wont happen under an administration run by globalists ."	EXP

Look at it this way , both Bernie and Trump draw crowds in the tens of thousands of people , yet Hillary can't fill an old folks home . The Bernie rally in my podunk town in Northern California , even after he was pretty much out of it , drew around <NUMBER> people , and we had to stand around in the 102F heat for hours !

But almost all those hate speech forums are extremely moderated and everything except what they want is censored . I'm fine with censorship in a hate speech forum as long as it doesn't happen in a news forum . There is no special impartiality in them . I'd say they obviously have less impariality . Since they are unwilling or sometimes so unbelievably retarded that they are incapable of understanding bias . Everyone is biased . Some people act on that bias to silence others ( like the mods of numerous subreddits see / r / subredditcancer or / r / opression ) . Other than the concern trolls , I haven't seen any censorship on this subreddit .

Now that's a silly way to counter the facts . bullet drop is the same , hit registration is just as bad Nope , bullet drop is much different , especially for rocket launchers . Most guns generally have much more range than they did in BC2 . There are also various attachments that effect range . Hit registration is much improved than BC2 ' s . BF3 doesn't suffer BC2 ' s sniper hitboxes . What you are most likely complaining about is the lag compensation . There are many ways to handle lag , but generally the best way is to prioritize the shooter's perspective . At least , to my knowledge . The old maps could have supported <NUMBER> players if they added more spawn points all of these features were possible before they just restricted them . Oh god no , that would of been terrible for the console port that BC2 was . Bad company's mechanics were made for <NUMBER> in mind . Even <NUMBER> players was pushing it . Heavy Metal is probably the only map that could fit that bill anyway . Your argument for why it is different is that they released the game they promised <NUMBER> years ago and labeled everything that should have been in the last game as a new feature They never promised <NUMBER> players , jets , etc . they promised a sequel to Bad Company . Which is more or less consilized Battlefield to compete with CoD's audience . Even more so with BC2 . Eventually we got a successor to BF2 , which features many concepts from both BF2 and BC2 .

15322	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

I'm kind of bored with the ranty and shouty style that even some people that didn't use to do it , are picking up now . I get that is good for comedic or entertainment purposes from time to time , but when you spend a whole video shouting or ranting , it's just not funny , nor interesting to me . Last That Guy T's video on BLM was cringey to watch for me for that reason , even though he had good points through all of it . Also response videos where people say more than once "" this is just stupid / non-sense / idiotic , etc "" withouth giving an argument to explain why . It is at least prevalent enough to the point that TL ;D R took on that subject on his video "" Intellectual rigour vs . Pwnage "" . Great channel , btw . I don't mind the right wing opinions as much as the lack of objectivity or at least some level of self awareness from either side . I got interested on Paul Joseph Watson for a couple of weeks but I completely lost interest after I watched his video "" The mainstreaming of pedophilia "" , there were a couple of things he said that I knew where straight up lies and exaggerations . Also in his video "" The thruth about modern art "" , he took a lot of elements of a video made in PragerU's channel called "" Why is modern art so bad ? "" and gave zero credit to the original source . He also shouts a lot . For me , Sargon is kind of okay overall , but I have heard him say a few times things that are a little bit non-sensical and almost conspiratorial , I can't remember exactly what right now , I'll go through the videos I've watched of him to try to remember and edit later . At this point I think he is kind of self-aggrandized and takes himself way too seriously and is starting to lack self awareness . To be honest , I lost a little respect for him after his whole petition to ban SJW classes debacle and almost completely stopped watching . Also , his debate with Kristi Winters was disappointing to say the least . I used to like Honey Badger Radio a lot , but it's difficult to follow a channel when the majority of its videos are more than an hour long . I stopped watching shortly after they started their Rantzerker series , I know that I don't need to say it one more time , but I'm seriously done with rants and shouting about SJWs . I like some of FeminismLOL videos , but I think she's too deep into MGTOW and her videos about Sargon and the Kate Brooks saga , seemed a little overcritical and uncalled for , like she was expecting to get a huge "" Gotcha !

15515	boardgames	no , not really . Most of the games I play end up being two <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> points , and one <NUMBER> or fewer . However , it's usually very easy to tell who is going to have the <NUMBER> points . A few things I've gathered over many games : People who get development cards generally win . The more you have , the easier it is . The robber helps the player with development cards win . The player with development cards is also often the player who can get cities easiest . There are <NUMBER> ( and sometimes <NUMBER> ) points that often rapidly change hands <NUMBER> / 3rds of the way through the game ( longest road and largest army ) . It's usually easy to predict this . For example , the longer a development card sits in front of someone , the more likely it is to be road building / monopoly . At least , with my group . Trading becomes much less ... innocent , the more frequently you play with someone . There are <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> people I play with who are very , very cagey with their cards at this point . We rarely will trade <NUMBER> resource for just <NUMBER> other . It's usually at least <NUMBER> for <NUMBER> . This is heavily influenced by who has the best position ( not who is currently leading ) . Finally , if you aren't first or second to secure a solid position on the board , you are likely out of the running for the game unless you get very , very lucky . - - - who can make the most devious trades at the end We almost never trade with people who have <NUMBER> points . It's too easy to give them a win by accident . The only exception is when trading gives you a victory first ( which means they won't trade with you ... ) find the most creative way to get that last point . There are really only two ways : development cards , or brute force . Brute force is just out spending your opponents ; lots of cities , settlements , and roads ( for longest ) . This is harder when people realize what you're doing and robber you up . Dev cards you've been planning for several rounds , and everyone already is wary of you . You probably have largest army , a road builder card , maybe a monopoly ... It's harder to defend against . I probably play too many boardgames ... this post ended up being longer than I intended . :D	NOT

15933	askscience	"Well , here's the rub : it's not really sensible to talk about the mass of an individual bound nucleon ; the mass you refer to ( where a proton weighs a little less than a neutron ) is for a free neutron or proton . When nucleons come together to form a nucleus , the process gives off energy - - and the system loses a corresponding amount of mass ( E = mc ^ <NUMBER> ) . So if you think about the "" mass "" of a proton in a carbon - <NUMBER> nucleus , it is smaller than for a hydrogen - <NUMBER> nucleus ( i . e . a free proton ) . This is what is referred to as the "" mass defect "" and , when you convert it to energy , indicates the "" binding energy "" for the nucleus ( which is the energy it would take to blast the nucleus apart into its component free nucleons ) . So what you should think about is that when you have a beta decay , the creation of the emitted particle consumes a fraction of the energy released by moving a nucleon ( and thus the nucleus ) to a lower energy state . The rest of that energy is usually carried off as kinetic energy ( of the beta particle / neutrino / nucleus / Auger electron ) and / or a gamma ray . In fact , this interchange of mass and energy is what enables us to predict whether a nuclear decay will occur ! If the decay decreases the total mass ( of the nucleus plus any particles it emits ) , we know that it also releases energy and thus is moving "" downhill "" towards a more stable system with a higher binding energy ."

16165	rpg	Their construction is actually pretty awesome . As I understand it , it's not physically possible to create those polyhedrons except by 3D printer . The ones I have are the Antique Bronze Matte . They've got some serious weight to them ( made of metal ) and they are every bit as pointy as they look . I haven't drawn blood yet , but that d4 could wreck a bare foot , lol . I have all my campaign notes on Google Docs that way I can write them out on my desktop and pull them up on my laptop while running the game . I'm in the market for a tablet to further improve this process while minimizing the table space requirement , but Google just completely threw me off by mentioning the possibility of a Nexus-like tablet . Anyway ... We meet every Sunday at one of the guys ' house around <NUMBER> , start playing around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , end around <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> . We alternate Sundays with me running a Divine 4e campaign and one of the other guys running a Pathfinder game . My game has the party as reincarnated high priests of Pelor getting sent out as a crack team of undead stompers . They're going up against one Vecna's top lieutenants , Osterneth , the Bronze Lich . I tossed out most of her back story and came up with my own , though keeping her personality traits . The world itself is one that I've run another campaign in about a year ago , except the current campaign is <NUMBER> years in the future after she's taken over and rules most of the world with undead . Suffice to say the party from the first campaign failed to stop her , lol . Unfortunately , two of the <NUMBER> players from that group ( not my Sunday group ) moved away and the game had to end . I was a little relieved because running <NUMBER> games simultaneously while playing in a 3rd is a wee bit taxing . I only got the thorn dice about a month ago and now I make sure to use them to maximum dramatic effect . Sometimes it's a treasure role , sometimes it's letting the dice decide how a chaotic NPC will respond , sometimes it's an environmental hazard or random encounter . They never know except that it means something interesting is about to happen .	NOT
16166	Christianity	Well , yes . As I see it , you either believe the bible , or you don't . When there is an apparent conflict , you have to somehow reconcile it . Either the bible is right , or it's wrong . I've encountered many difficult scriptures that seem to conflict with the obvious and have usually found upon deeper inspection that either my understanding of the obvious was wrong or I was not correctly interpreting scripture . Not everyone believes the bible literally . I do . I don't see any other way . To read it and take bits and pieces of it that satisfy you or fit your world view is to destroy the whole thing I think , or turn it into nothing more than a book of philosophy . I cannot do that . Many can , I cannot - it would be illogical . Now , because I came to conclude that our understanding of evolution is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the biblical account of creation , I've dived deeper and have discovered science that better fits my world view . You can see a lot of it at [ Answers in Genesis ] ( <URL> and and [ The Institute for Creation Research ] ( <URL> I recommend you check out those sites .

It's just hard to throw such nonsense around when you see them for what they are , metal , wood , plastic , and not for what the anti-gun side wants you to believe they are . Gun control groups THRIVE on this ignorance . No gun control group will ever recommend education on the topic . - The one issue I take with the article is it makes too much of an issue between left and right . Democrat and Republican . Guns are not a partisan issue for the American people - they're a partisan issue for politicians . There are plenty of anti-gun Republicans who don't trust good inner city law abiding people with guns , and plenty of pro-gun Democrats that don't want to vote for Hillary because of her extreme gun control ( really , people control ) views .

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers .

All I got back was a "" haha it's cool "" or a "" keep it up mang "" . These comments are basically polite ways of saying "" I dont care "" or "" I feel nothing "" . Honestly , I would rather them have trashed it , at least then they would have had to engage with it on some meaningful level . I think a lot of people are aware their creative pursuits are dead ends , when others blow smoke the cognitive dissonance ( sorry ) just makes them feel uncomfortable . Someone confirming the self-doubt may be seen as a bad thing , just convincing you to stop , but it can also be freeing in that it identifies a problem , meaning you can go and actually work towards fixing the problem . I think everyone already knows this , but I try to always have two things on my plate at any one time : creative outlets AND a traditional job . The bad times usually come when someone says "" why can't my creative outlet BE my job ? "" If the value of your creative pursuits hinges on you being widely respected for it , then you don't really value it all that much ."	EXP

16722	fatpeoplehate	Thanks so much , I'm learning a lot . I'm going to start with your last sentence . This is what distinguishes us from the lardos . I have to put in a good amount of effort to maintain or gain weight , but I do it . Because I want to be healthy . I could easily spend all day on the couch and turn into a skinny-fat , but why would I want to live my life that way ? Whereas that's what they do to turn into fat-fats , and then proceed to complain ( and brag ) on every social media site they have access to . Do something real about it I knew about dehydration and veins , but not sodium levels . I guess that would go along with other electrolytes as well ? You can even try this out for yourself w / regard to blood pressure - tighten a leather belt around your arm above your bicep ( near your armpit ) , and squeeze your fist . Watch those veins pop right out . Ha , drug addict <NUMBER> , I should have put that together . In regards to bf % , of course that makes sense , I'm an idiot . Women ( for the most part ) are not angular , because we're naturally higher . You're right about having advantages , makes it easier . But the fatties complaining non-stop about their genetics and their inability to change anything makes me sick . Keep shitlording it up , and thanks again for all the info Edit - I think we're both on the same page now . Yes , genetics play a role . But there are multiple steps you can take to overcome them , as are there multiple reasons to use them as an excuse . It's the difference between not being a dickbag and taking the easy way out , or completely giving up on life .	EXP
16723	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

16923	nazi	"<NUMBER> . Jesus taught Judaism . He taught the <NUMBER> books of Moses . He even tells his followers to keep studying those books . <NUMBER> . He taught the golden rule : "" Do to others what you want them to do to you . This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets "" ( Matthew <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> NCV , see also Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ) . But since Jesus was a Pharisee , he learned this from the Jewish Pharisee Hillel ( who was born <NUMBER> years before Jesus ): That which is hateful to you , do not do to your fellow . That is the whole Torah ; the rest is the explanation ; go and learn it . He even does the shema , which Jews are asked to do when they wake up and before going to bed . Literally everything he does is Judaism , with the exception of suggesting he is God . <NUMBER> . In fact , in the gospels they try to write in all of the things that a Messiah would need to be under Judaism ( riding in to Jerusalem on a donkey , etc . ) But it's based on the Jewish Messiah . Never mind that the Jewish Messiah was supposed to usher in world peace when he arrived ; that didn't happen so to Jews he is not the Messiah . Additionally , to be the Messiah a Jew had to be born from the Jewish line of David that passed through the father . In Mark , the first written of the Gospels there is no mention of his lineage or birth . So then in later Gospels they add in that both his Jewish mother and father had ties back to the Jewish king David to satisfy the requirements for Jesus to be the Messiah . Of course , you're aware that his father did not actually provide the seed , so this he did not obtain the lineage from his father as is required under Jewish law . <NUMBER> . I have read the bible and the gospels . Jews debate because that is how they are taught . Why do you think you rest starting Friday night ? That's because of the Shabbat that came from the Jews and it starts at the end of Friday . One of the many examples where Jesus seems to "" fight "" with the Jews is when one of his followers picks wheat from the field . According to Judaism they aren't allowed to because it's considered work and you are expected to rest on Shabbat . Breaking Shabbat was worthy of the death penalty so this was serious . Many see it as "" fighting "" but if I knew you were doing something serious under the law I'd rather I'd give you a heads up to let you know that you're potentially violating the law so that you have a chance to stop it . Jesus then argues the Jewish law because he is Jewish and knows the law to say that there is an exception to this work on Shabbat and that picking the grain was okay . Notice that Jesus himself doesn't break the Shabbat , it's one of his followers that he is teaching Judaism . <NUMBER> . You're implying that he taught crucifixion ? The Jews didn't crucify Jesus . It was the Romans and that's how they would kill people to send a message . <NUMBER> . If you are a practicing Christian , you realize that everything Jesus taught is based on the Jewish Torah . If I ask you how the world was created and you believe in Christianity , it's with Adam and Eve . So from a religious standpoint , the argument that there are different distinct races doesn't work since we all came from Adam and Eve . Again this is the book that Jesus learned and taught . <NUMBER> . Feel free to send me a link to a geneticist that shows that Germans are distinct from all the other races and that they evolved into humans separately from other races .

I had misunderstandings every hour [ that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature ] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [ and other awkward attempts at being "" good "" ] ? Why would the doctors tell my parents that I was ALmost autistic [ after-all Asperger's is a milder form of autism ] when I was having those problems at elementary schools ?

17399	sjwhate	So you didn't read this bit : The German troops had been fighting for two weeks straight without a break , something that an old Great War soldier like Hitler knew all too well . They needed time to rest , replace their losses and reorganize their forces , which had taken heavy losses in France . The German armor had outrun their infantry and supplies , having advanced much faster than expected , and were running out of fuel and ammunition . Also , the ground around the Dunkirk area wasn ’ t ideal for tank operations , full of the marshes and canals that had bogged down German soldiers in the First World War . The pause made sense to Hitler for another reason : Luftwaffe head Herman Goring had assured him that air power could wipe out the British on the beaches , and Hitler was all too happy to give him a chance .

17571	leagueoflegends	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around <NUMBER> to cast <NUMBER> to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an <NUMBER> mana , <NUMBER> turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip with + <NUMBER> / + <NUMBER> , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : <NUMBER> multicolored mana and <NUMBER> turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost <NUMBER> black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only . Sight Ward : Wouldn ’ t even be good if it cost <NUMBER> . Maybe cantrip it when it dies ? Vision Ward : Even worse than sight ward . Cantrip ’ ing it would still make it worse than a cantrip ’ d sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward . Warwick : Suffers from the exact same problems as corki , too complicated for an uncommon , will never find a place in constructed , but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity .	NOT

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

That is not what you are seeing here . While the numbers have gone up , they are going up less wildly over time . That is of course to be expected , but what isn't is his wildly shifting switch between rate of earnings compared to number of patrons , at which this month Patrons overtook earnings for the first time . That said , both have essentially plateaued and not exceeded ( yet , admittedly ) the highest amount from the month previous . Whats worse , and this is where knowing how users on Patreon behave comes in handy , Dax saw a big dropoff in earnings BEFORE the end of the month last month . That means many patrons , realizing another pay day was coming , purposefully pulled their pledges to stop this from happening . I'm thankful they did , because a few of those pledges then went to me , but that is beside the point . The usual dropoff you see is at the end of the month , because patron pledges decline or their info was put in wrong , so I am ignoring those drops . But last month multiple people purposefully dropped their pledges , and according to the numbers it looks like they did not come back . I guess all the ads Dick has been putting on Facebook worked slightly and brough over a few new patrons , but they are spending less than the patrons in previous months , and that is likely because they aren't the "" hot goss "" fueled patrons from before who finally are quitting . So unless he manages to pull some more goss-fueled magic out of his ass , my prediction is January will see the first flatline , and come end of February that line will start dropping .

"" Yo what I never understood is why don't teachers actually give more problems where it's impractical to use the other methods ? If you truly understand the limitations and practical applications of the methods you are teaching , this should be easy . For example , suppose you are teaching the application of calculus to finding minima and maxima . If you ask me to find the minimum of the function x ^ <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> x + <NUMBER> , obviously I wouldn't bother to use calculus , I would immediately recognize that it factors as ( x - <NUMBER> ) ^ <NUMBER> . Instead , you should ask me to find the minimum x ^ <NUMBER> + 3x ^ <NUMBER> + <NUMBER> on the interval [ - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> ] or something . Here's another example : Solve the equation sin ( x ) + cos ( x ) = k . Yes one method is to write cos ( x ) in terms of sin ( x ) and do out the algebra and quadratic formula . But suppose the student is clever and realizes that you may rewrite the left side as sqrt ( <NUMBER> ) sin ( x + pi / <NUMBER> ) . Then he just needs to solve sin ( x + pi / <NUMBER> ) = k / sqrt ( <NUMBER> ) which is much easier . Basically I disagree with penalizing students for using correct methods that work .

18208	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

18252	politics	I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here : <URL> Basically , due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering , he starts by smashing the military industrial complex , bringing the troops home , and ending corporate welfare . These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

18508	fatpeoplehate	"EDIT : If you're going to disagree and downvote , feel free to at least state why you think I am wrong . I didn't downvote you , I just read your comment . Obligatory I'm not a doctor , I'm speaking from experience and layman observation . Anyway , I can see where you come from , but let me put it like this : I quit smoking , it's the only addiction I ever had and it wasn't easy . Obviously , nowhere near as hard as quitting a hardcore drug . There's challenges inherent to each substance , naturally , but what I learned was that there's two elements to addiction : "" chemical addiction "" the stuff that makes you physically sick when you initially quit a substance , and "" habit "" . Depending on your relationship with your drug of choice , either will present obstacles in your recovery . In my case , the chemical addiction was easy to deal with , after the first week I had no issues . The trick was always the habit . When you're addicted to something , you adjust your life around addiction in order function , so you have so many triggers , lots of them unconscious - if you're in a place where you can smoke freely , you'll smoke without giving it a lot of thought , you don't even "" enjoy "" the cigarettes , unless you have waited more than usual between cigarettes . This was so . freaking . hard . It's the reason why so many fall of wagon and can't quit . So what did I do ? I took responsibility for my habits and changed them , made myself aware of my triggers and consciously dealt with them . This would have been <NUMBER> times harder , if I had smokes readily available for me . Thankfully no one else around me smoked , so it was just a matter of never buying cigarettes again . This is when I talk about food addiction again : you can't stop buying food or eating . We all need to eat in order to live . Even replacing all your junk food for healthy food , still leaves you with a deeply formed habit ( more likely from childhood - it's not genetics , people , it's that your parents didn't know how to eat either and are fat , too ) , so you can eat healthier or think you eat healthier ( there's so much fat logic out there , that some people have no idea what eating healthy means ) and still eat enough calories daily to maintain weight or even gain . So yes , you're right in the sense that food addiction is so different because the chemical addiction while it's still there ( the brain's reward center is activated when you eat ) is very small compared to the chemical addiction to say , heroine . But the habit in itself is a deeply rooted issue for the food addict , all the same . They need to restructure all their lives , battle all the fat logic they have and in many cases , mental therapy to deal with all shock to their lifestyle . They do this while a lot of ( fat ) people around them validate their addiction , and they're told on the internet that "" society needs to change , love your fat body "" and HAES crap . It's reasonable that you would have a problem with society displaying the same kind of sympathy for a meth addict in recovery , than they have for an obese person , but truth of the matter is that our societies are far from that .

Even the spanish experts questioned brought up what an odd statement it would be to make : <NUMBER> - The experts considered it worth noting that the phrase "" porque tu eres negro "" struck both of them as slightly unusual . In this instance , a direct racial slur would more likely have been something like "" porque eres un negro de mierda "" [ because you are a shitty black ] . I could see him maybe say "" No me hablas , negro "" ( don't talk to me , negro ) after Evra is telling him he will kick or punch him . And given the context of Evra telling Suarez he will hit him , "" Dale negro "" ( something like "" Do it , negro "" ) seems like something someone might say . Still not pretty , but when the accusation against Suarez is based off of holes in his statement and a reliance on the accuracy of Evra's testimony , these seem like important things to take into consideration ."

18874	uncensorednews	Then what are we even talking about here ? Perhaps if you read what I wrote , you might understand better what I am discussing ?

A job is a wage , not a good or a service . Minimum pricing for goods / services are only contested if they are deemed a competitive market issue , such as if a major chain charged cents on the dollar for a good or service that others do in order to run those other businesses out and then raise their own prices . That is a form of controlling the price , but it is not Price Control . Minimum wages are a form of Wage Control , not price control .

18976	Baking	First off , congrats on having a passion at such a young age . People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing , and can stay happy doing every day . When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts . At <NUMBER> my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies . While theater , the environment , and dozens of other things pique my interest , working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of . Cooking , baking , thinking up recipes , feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created ; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking , and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them . After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

19025	Fitness	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation . One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard , if not impossible , to improve both strenh and conditioning greatly at the same time .	NOT

19039	fatpeoplehate	For the record , I've upvoted you because you're adding to the discussion . Fried things aren't inherently bad . It causes some very wonderful chemical reactions to occur that allow for extremely complex and rich savory flavors . Also , for some of us , we actually need a little more fat in our diets . The meal plan that I worked out for this week somehow ended up at only 39g of fat a day , when I was shooting for <NUMBER> - 72g . I purposefully fried part of the meal in order to add lipids to my diet ( and don't worry , I accounted for everything calorically already ) , so it was actually beneficial and healthy ( amusingly enough ) to have fried part of my meals . All of that said , I'm actually a little concerned is all . Not eating foods because you don't want to or because you don't like their taste or because you think they're not worth the caloric payment is totally fine . But the way your post reads makes it seem like fried foods make you anxious , which is why you stay away from them . And that's not healthy . I'm only saying this because I don't want anyone large or small to have an unhealthy relationship with foods . It's okay to hate a food with a passion . It's okay to like a food but never eat it . But you should never feel scared , anxious , or overly-conscious about a food . Think of it this way . A large egg hard-boiled is about <NUMBER> calories . A large fried egg is about <NUMBER> calories . That still means that I could eat <NUMBER> fried eggs in a day . They're not horrible for you . Yes , their calorie count per egg is a little higher , but if you look at it as just another number , you might be able to see it more logically as a trade-off on different flavors vs . a little more calorically . And if you don't want to have fried eggs or if you don't like their taste or texture , that's perfectly fine . But they're nothing to be scared of . They're not going to make you fat . The power to make you fat or skinny is still <NUMBER> % your power , and no food can change that . PS , I'm very sorry if I read into your post wrong . Feel free to correct me if I did pick up the wrong message . I always , always care more about knowing what's right than I do my feelings , and I won't feel upset or embarrassed to be told I'm wrong if I'm told what's right .	EXP

19148	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

19155	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT
19156	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one .

Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts .

19631	fatpeoplehate	"Used to swim ( and eat ) that much with <NUMBER> % body fat . It's not exaggerated . In terms of weight gain , a calorie is not strictly a calorie . When you're working out multiple times a day , your body is processing food as though it's needed for energy at any moment , because chances are it is . This is mediated largely by insulin with other hormones playing a role as well . Effectively , if you're working out enough hours per day ( and the spacing here matters . 3x3 hrs . is better than one <NUMBER> hr . block ) you can eat almost unlimited calories and few to none will be stored as fat because your muscles are in full-time "" oh-fuck-give-us-more-glucose "" mode ( it's often said that the liver is the main storage for glucose , which is true by concentration , but by total quantity muscles dominate ) . FWIW , this is also why ketogenic diets can be very effective in treating obesity . They normalize a completely fucked insulin response so that the body is less likely to store dietary calories as fat ( and more likely to burn fat-stored calories for energy . Double win ) . This is also why shitlords can get away with eating a lot of something unhealthy like cake or ice cream ON OCCASION . Ever notice that if you eat much more than you burn in a day , you still don't instantly gain weight ? Your body is keeping a lot of those calories around as fast-energy : protein and glycogen .

"" I believe in God , <NUMBER> % , but I know and accept that I can't prove it so in essence it is unknowable . Where agnostic really falls in is on the nature of God , what God's true will is , what Christ's true teachings were and if they were corrupted in translation , is the organised church good ? All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang . Not to mention the model of abiogenesis has to account for starting evolution , ie the first organism would have to be capable of reproducing and evolving . edit : grammar"	NOT

So if you're not clinical , don't look too much at their programs . They also have , at least in the US , a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs . They have to take tests and such . Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research , so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures . Different areas will focus on different things . I can't imaging a perceptual psych ( what I am ) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area . Most people in my area tend to come from physics , engineering , computer science ... so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads . UBC has a great program I remember looking at it seriously , but they required a psych subject test , which I was not about to study for just for an application ( I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad , and had no interest in general psych ) , and I wasn't sure about leaving the US .
