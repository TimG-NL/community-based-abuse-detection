59	nazi	"<NUMBER> . Jesus taught Judaism . He taught the <NUMBER> books of Moses . He even tells his followers to keep studying those books . <NUMBER> . He taught the golden rule : "" Do to others what you want them to do to you . This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets "" ( Matthew <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> NCV , see also Luke <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ) . But since Jesus was a Pharisee , he learned this from the Jewish Pharisee Hillel ( who was born <NUMBER> years before Jesus ): That which is hateful to you , do not do to your fellow . That is the whole Torah ; the rest is the explanation ; go and learn it . He even does the shema , which Jews are asked to do when they wake up and before going to bed . Literally everything he does is Judaism , with the exception of suggesting he is God . <NUMBER> . In fact , in the gospels they try to write in all of the things that a Messiah would need to be under Judaism ( riding in to Jerusalem on a donkey , etc . ) But it's based on the Jewish Messiah . Never mind that the Jewish Messiah was supposed to usher in world peace when he arrived ; that didn't happen so to Jews he is not the Messiah . Additionally , to be the Messiah a Jew had to be born from the Jewish line of David that passed through the father . In Mark , the first written of the Gospels there is no mention of his lineage or birth . So then in later Gospels they add in that both his Jewish mother and father had ties back to the Jewish king David to satisfy the requirements for Jesus to be the Messiah . Of course , you're aware that his father did not actually provide the seed , so this he did not obtain the lineage from his father as is required under Jewish law . <NUMBER> . I have read the bible and the gospels . Jews debate because that is how they are taught . Why do you think you rest starting Friday night ? That's because of the Shabbat that came from the Jews and it starts at the end of Friday . One of the many examples where Jesus seems to "" fight "" with the Jews is when one of his followers picks wheat from the field . According to Judaism they aren't allowed to because it's considered work and you are expected to rest on Shabbat . Breaking Shabbat was worthy of the death penalty so this was serious . Many see it as "" fighting "" but if I knew you were doing something serious under the law I'd rather I'd give you a heads up to let you know that you're potentially violating the law so that you have a chance to stop it . Jesus then argues the Jewish law because he is Jewish and knows the law to say that there is an exception to this work on Shabbat and that picking the grain was okay . Notice that Jesus himself doesn't break the Shabbat , it's one of his followers that he is teaching Judaism . <NUMBER> . You're implying that he taught crucifixion ? The Jews didn't crucify Jesus . It was the Romans and that's how they would kill people to send a message . <NUMBER> . If you are a practicing Christian , you realize that everything Jesus taught is based on the Jewish Torah . If I ask you how the world was created and you believe in Christianity , it's with Adam and Eve . So from a religious standpoint , the argument that there are different distinct races doesn't work since we all came from Adam and Eve . Again this is the book that Jesus learned and taught . <NUMBER> . Feel free to send me a link to a geneticist that shows that Germans are distinct from all the other races and that they evolved into humans separately from other races . If you have the scientific data to back that up I'd love to see it ."	EXP

128	politics	"I'm still working through this monolithic statement , but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House "" We the People "" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now . That being said , this statement is something to appreciate , and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism , attention to detail , and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times . Of particular interest to me is the administration's ( public ) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned . This is an occasion to be brief and direct . I have one concern not addressed thus far : That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military , legal recourse remains impossible to affect . As it stands , we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens , but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined , our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word . I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above , then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism . When that happens , it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse , as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government . Our liberties are more than just that ; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life , including our entire economy and government . The good news is that , for now , the public interpretation of the <NUMBER> NDAA safeguards our rights , so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations : that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents , those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned ."

Yoko visited Paul and asked him to talk to John about coming back when her own personal relationship on the side was over . Yoko obsessively called John almost on a daily basis , according to both John and May Pang during their separation . So John didn't come crawling back by any means .

186	uncensorednews	I don't think that argument makes sense . I think most analysts were quite confident in making their predictions about the outcome of the election . They just happened to be wrong . Suppose there are two possible outcomes , each equally probable , which are expected to produce a gain of $ <NUMBER> for the first outcome , or $ <NUMBER> for the second . The market would adjust to an expected gain of $ <NUMBER> rather than hanging around $ <NUMBER> or even lower due to uncertainty . If the first outcome is considered more likely than the second , then the market would anticipate gains of greater than $ <NUMBER> depending on how probable the first outcome is believed to be . If the first outcome is considered to be a complete certainty , then the market would adjust to an anticipated gain of $ <NUMBER> . Outcomes are weighted according to their perceived likelihood . The outcome of the election caught almost everyone by surprise . I find it highly unlikely that people were weighting the possibility of a Trump victory very heavily . Stock prices shot up when he won because the expected outcome , a Hillary victory , was one in which stocks were expected to perform worse than they would have under Trump . To go back to the $ <NUMBER> and $ <NUMBER> model , people thought Hillary was almost sure to win and that she was the lower performing outcome . Stocks were adjusting to something like $ <NUMBER> or $ <NUMBER> ( much closer to Hillary's side , since her victory was weighted more heavily ) , and when she lost the market corrected to the $ <NUMBER> expectation . If Hillary had won , there would have been a small negative adjustment as the relatively slim chance of Trump winning and producing the higher outcome would have fallen to zero , dropping from $ <NUMBER> or $ <NUMBER> down to $ <NUMBER> . The spike is a result of Trump being expected to produce greater returns for the stock market as well as the low probability of victory that almost all analysts had given him going into the night of the election .

You really have to EARN the ability to do a bang reel right . I'm talking hundreds of videos of actually visually distinct , well-produced content .

502	askscience	It's not a raster . I think they typically use an MCP ( microchannel plate ) to amplify the signal , and I don't know what kind of CCD . The counts are measured in 2D , all at once . The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample . The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface ( and the reflectivity depends on different surface features ) . You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector ( CCD or MCP ) . The intensity of electrons at the detector ( or brightness of the image ) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample . So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions . The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy ( typically zero to a couple of tens of eV ) . When you image the sample , you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most . You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy .

602	fatpeoplehate	"My ( attractive / fit ) brother , my ( fit-ish attractive ) friend and my ( very hot , fitish , semi famous ) ex are friends with this guy D . D is a fat as fuck douche . His brother M , who is a good friend of mine , is fit and hot . These people all are part of the same group , along with a hand full of other fit or skinny more or less attractive people . D makes a point to get in everyone's business , throw fits , steals food , and generally acts like a giant entitled , alcoholic toddler . He has to be THE LIFE OF THE PARTY and center of attention . He is convinced his rather short , almost spherical body is big and strong and manly because he used to do some martial arts years and years ago . He thinks he is a suave stud , a genius , and legit acts like some red-pill negging art of seduction tard . He clings / mooches on my brother so that he can flash around our family name ( virtually a house hold name in the metroplex / state we live in ) for some semblance of status and so that my brother will buy him stuff and let him use our guns / vehicles / land / food / ranch . He does the same clingy moochy bullshit to The Ex so he can get a share of the lime light , fuck the frustrated groupies ( The Ex is apparently not over me , and quite picky ) , and act all important "" riding his coattails "" as it were . They both put up with him because he fronts like he's their good friend and flatters their vanitys while actually being a back stabbing jerk . My ex also has depression bipolar disorder leading to an over indulgence problem with alcohol / substances which D intentionally makes worse so that The Ex will still hang around him . He doesn't drive ( too many tickets for speeding and unsafe driving ) and expects everyone to cater to his whims . He makes mean jokes and picks on others all he time , but gets really fucking butt hurt if anyone retaliates , then acts like a middle school girl to get back at you . If he isnt getting female attention ( usually doesnt happen until late in the night when everyone is shwasted ) he goes around butting in and cockblocking and telling embarrassing stories about his friends and generally being a nuisance . He constantly brags about all the tail he pulls , but I know for a fact that , in all reality , he uses his non threatening appearance to get girls to trust him ( similar to The Gay Best Friend ) . He then gets them stupid drunk and basically date rapes them . Usually they can't get past third base because its to hard what with juggling a near passed out chick , his giant gut , and that he is also very drunk . He attempted to rape my best friend last year . He was drunk as fuck while we were all partying for his birthday . He wanted birthday sex . My best friend was quite inexperienced with guys at the time , was shy and reserved . They were flirting a bit and fooled around but nothing serious ( M was driving at the time and I was in shotgun . ) When everyone went into the bar , D convinced my friend to stay outside and then tried to rape her . I happened to go out or a smoke at just the right time and put a stop to it . It devolved into a whole messy situation that I'm too lazy to type out right now but ended in me LITERALLY fighting D off my friend multiple times in the bar parking lot while we waited for our ride and then as we were walking to their car . He didn't want her to leave , and couldnt understand why my bestie wasnt interested in a stud like him . He excused his actions by , i shit you not , saying "" b-b-but it's my birthday "" with this look of utter confusion on his face . To this day he acts like nothing happened ."	EXP

Where agnostic really falls in is on the nature of God , what God's true will is , what Christ's true teachings were and if they were corrupted in translation , is the organised church good ? All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable . Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly , I have an opinion on the demarcation problem . I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in . For example , I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief ; not proof . Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God ; that's rational but not proof . The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible . There is a line somewhere , that's to be certain , but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point . Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things Yes , different "" things "" but why make that distinction ? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology , including things like cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and dark matter , from the big bang . Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang .

I had misunderstandings every hour [ that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature ] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [ and other awkward attempts at being "" good "" ] ?

797	holocaust	Bigger Issue This , of course , brings us to the bigger issue , which is , how do we know what really happened ? The answer to that question is historical research , but that is precisely what the delict “ holocaust denial ” has been created to prevent . Holocaust denial is another word for Jewish control of discourse , in particular historical discourse , in particular historical discourse about World War II . If a historian publishes something that a powerful Jew , which is to say a Jew with powerful backers , dislikes , that person will be punished . If the person in question lives by writing books , as David Irving once did , the Lipstadt brigade will get him blacklisted in the publishing industry . If the person in question is a professor , the big Jews will try to get him fired , as Deborah Lipstadt herself did in the case of Professor David O ’ Connell . In this instance , Lipstadt failed , but David O ’ Connell ’ s case is not typical in this regard . More typical is the case of Norman Finkelstein , who was fired from his job at DePaul University in Chicago . The fact that Finkelstein was a Jew himself doesn ’ t matter . It ’ s the big Jews , in this case Alan Dershowitz , who decide who is to live and who ’ s to die in academe and publishing . Finkelstein wrote a devastating critique of Dershowitz ’ s book The Case for Israel , and , as a result , Dershowitz set out to destroy Finkelstein ’ s career . It was , in many ways , a typically Jewish response , the academic version of “ You ’ ll never work in this town again . ” What followed was equally Jewish . In fact Finkelstein characterized the dispute as a contest over “ who was the toughest Jew from Borough Park . ” The definitive answer to that question is in : the big Jew from Borough Park is Alan Dershowitz , who got Finkelstein fired with the collaboration of the supine Catholic priest who is president of DePaul University . Among other things , this also shows that a selection process is at work among Jews in academe . Any Jew who goes against the interests of organized Jewry will get destroyed by the ruthless academic enforcer Jews who represent their interests . Most Jews are immune to struggles like this because they fall into the broad , gray middle category of fellow travelers , Jews who go along with the agenda in order to collect big salaries for a cushy job . But there are larger lessons to be learned here . First of all , when if comes to a choice between money and principle , Catholic universities go for the money . Secondly , the fact that academe has become the site of unseemly brawls like this is largely the result of Jewish influence in academe . As Professor Lipstadt made abundantly clear in her talk , the university not the place where the big Jews seek the truth . The university is a place where Jews settle scores . It ’ s where they punish people who threaten the Jewish hegemony over discourse . This should not surprise us . The university is not a Jewish creation . It is a Catholic creation of the Catholic Middle Ages , and so it should not come as a surprise that Jews have all of the difficulties which come with functioning in an alien environment when they are admitted to universities . For over <NUMBER> years , from roughly the beginning of the 13th to the middle of the 19th century , Catholics were involved in the creation and preservation of the university as a place where one engaged in the disinterested pursuit of the truth . This was also the place and period of time during which representational art reached its culmination as well . The link between these phenomena--art and the university as manifestations of the Logos which finds its embodiment in Christ and its cultural expression in Catholicism--is no coincidence . Conversely , the Jewish subversion of academe is similar to the Jewish subversion of the art world , something which occurred during the same period of time and , as Israel Shamir points out in a brilliant article “ A Study of Art , ” in his book , Caballa of Power , for the same reasons . If the culmination of Catholic culture was the creation of the university , the culmination of Jewish culture was capitalism , which , over the course of the latter half of the 20th century in America , gradually devoured the university , by restructuring it according to capitalist , which is to say , Jewish principles , in particular those articulated by Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys , a gang of thugs which rivals Professor Lipstadt in its brutality . The institution of tenure , which was a relic of the Middle Ages , was subverted and then replaced by a system in which Jewish superstar professors like Stanley Fish could earn six figure salaries ( While at UIC , Stanley Fish earned more per annum than the Governor of Illinois ) , while the majority of the teaching was done by wage slave adjuncts . . This is not my opinion ; it is the verdict of Heinrich Graetz , the father of Jewish historiography , who claimed in his magnum opus that the study of the Talmud led to the moral corruption of the Polish Jews : To twist a phrase out of its meaning , to use all the tricks of the clever advocate , to play upon words , and to condemn what they did not know . . . such were the characteristics of the Polish Jew . . . . Honesty and right-thinking he lost as completely as simplicity and truthfulness . He made himself master of all the gymnastics of the Schools and applied them to obtain advantage over any one more cunning than himself . He took delight in cheating and overreaching , which gave him a sort of joy of victory . But his own people he could not treat that way : they were as knowing as he . It was the non-Jew who , to his loss , felt the consequences of the Talmudically trained mind of the Polish Jew . <URL>	EXP

814	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	False . Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates . Carbohydrate molecules are , by definition , already half oxidized ( oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use , so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use ) . That's why our bodies use glycogen ( a carbohydrate ) for short-term storage ( primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep ) , but fat for long-term storage . Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores . I'm not an expert either – I only have an undergraduate degree so far . But biology is a science , and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation , not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience . If you've found a weight loss method that works for you ( and a weight maintenance method for when you reach your goal – that's where many people fail ) , great , congrats . But that doesn't mean that the explanations you invent for why it's working for you are accurate , or will lead to the same results for others .	NOT

970	politics	I don't think ideology is really the problem . It's more structural , the realities and necessities of power . Ideology serves only as rationale , justification , rhetorical cover as people who seek power , or seek to hold on to it , implement policies that are of benefit to the rich , influential , the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for . Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover , while implementing corporatist BS . Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism . See e . g . USSR and Maoist China . This is the lesson of Animal Farm . Those who are convinced capitalism / free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand , Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted , and used to do great evil . So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level , but try to improve people's understanding of the political system . It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul , they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians , or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology , or something . They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs , or funding Israel , next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us . System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them , as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons .	NOT

Ron Paul is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy ( like admitting he ’ s to the left of President Obama on Iran ) . You have to be a libertarian , which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy . I get what happens on Day <NUMBER> : You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions . What do you do on Day <NUMBER> ? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting ? Newt Gingrich is the front runner if you believe the polls . Personally , I can ’ t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him . But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help , then Mr . Gingrich is the right choice . He is anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-gun control , anti-judge , anti-almost anything you can name . The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system . His positions , starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary , are far too radical . ( By the way , his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate . ) It ’ s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman , when really he ’ s a history influence peddler , or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan , Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt . But , if you ’ re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn ’ t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises , vote for Mr . Gingrich . Mitt Romney . It ’ s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr . Romney , because we have no clue what he actually believes . If you ’ re opposed to health care reform , and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area , you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes , he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he ’ s been taking lately . He seems like the most electable of the group right now , mostly because he ’ s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers . He could , theoretically , pose the greatest threat to Mr . Obama .	NOT

1228	fatpeoplehate	For the record , I've upvoted you because you're adding to the discussion . Fried things aren't inherently bad . It causes some very wonderful chemical reactions to occur that allow for extremely complex and rich savory flavors . Also , for some of us , we actually need a little more fat in our diets . The meal plan that I worked out for this week somehow ended up at only 39g of fat a day , when I was shooting for <NUMBER> - 72g . I purposefully fried part of the meal in order to add lipids to my diet ( and don't worry , I accounted for everything calorically already ) , so it was actually beneficial and healthy ( amusingly enough ) to have fried part of my meals . All of that said , I'm actually a little concerned is all . Not eating foods because you don't want to or because you don't like their taste or because you think they're not worth the caloric payment is totally fine . But the way your post reads makes it seem like fried foods make you anxious , which is why you stay away from them . And that's not healthy . I'm only saying this because I don't want anyone large or small to have an unhealthy relationship with foods . It's okay to hate a food with a passion . It's okay to like a food but never eat it . But you should never feel scared , anxious , or overly-conscious about a food . Think of it this way . A large egg hard-boiled is about <NUMBER> calories . A large fried egg is about <NUMBER> calories . That still means that I could eat <NUMBER> fried eggs in a day . They're not horrible for you . Yes , their calorie count per egg is a little higher , but if you look at it as just another number , you might be able to see it more logically as a trade-off on different flavors vs . a little more calorically . And if you don't want to have fried eggs or if you don't like their taste or texture , that's perfectly fine . But they're nothing to be scared of . They're not going to make you fat . The power to make you fat or skinny is still <NUMBER> % your power , and no food can change that . PS , I'm very sorry if I read into your post wrong . Feel free to correct me if I did pick up the wrong message . I always , always care more about knowing what's right than I do my feelings , and I won't feel upset or embarrassed to be told I'm wrong if I'm told what's right .	EXP

1332	uncensorednews	You're doing a lot of side-stepping to avoid the very simply observation I made ( which I did without either condemning or condoning ) which is that the EU seems to violate the sovereignty of the nations which are in it . Yes , everyone who is in the EU agreed to be in the EU , and yes , the EU can make exceptions to its directives , and yes , the countries can violate the directives ( though fining those countries is absolutely a punishment ; a punishment that is meant to be a deterrent is still a punishment after all ) . The fact is they're still being told to do things by other countries which is ipso facto an infringement of sovereignty whether it's a good idea or not . If you have to e . g . restrict gun ownership or be punished by other countries then they are not respecting your sovereignty regardless of their motivation , the severity of punishment , moral justification , chance of appeal , etc . In fact , I will go even further than that and say that to be allowed to violate a directive is still a violation of sovereignty , because it is them granting you permission to do something and thus still being under their control , rather than you simply deciding to do something and them respecting your freedom to do it . You cannot give permission to someone you don't have authority over .	IMP

1439	fatpeoplehate	"Used to swim ( and eat ) that much with <NUMBER> % body fat . It's not exaggerated . In terms of weight gain , a calorie is not strictly a calorie . When you're working out multiple times a day , your body is processing food as though it's needed for energy at any moment , because chances are it is . This is mediated largely by insulin with other hormones playing a role as well . Effectively , if you're working out enough hours per day ( and the spacing here matters . 3x3 hrs . is better than one <NUMBER> hr . block ) you can eat almost unlimited calories and few to none will be stored as fat because your muscles are in full-time "" oh-fuck-give-us-more-glucose "" mode ( it's often said that the liver is the main storage for glucose , which is true by concentration , but by total quantity muscles dominate ) . FWIW , this is also why ketogenic diets can be very effective in treating obesity .

Others including bigger heights , skin or hair color , genious level intelligence and others . Some are positive , and some negative , yes . but a ton of them are neutral and basically meaningless like being left handed or mentioned skin color . And if using your logic to say skin color should be treated makes you uncomfortable , it should . It means your opinion is selective in its logic and you never bothered to apply the same logic to other things to test it .

1760	fatpeoplehate	Thanks so much , I'm learning a lot . I'm going to start with your last sentence . This is what distinguishes us from the lardos . I have to put in a good amount of effort to maintain or gain weight , but I do it . Because I want to be healthy . I could easily spend all day on the couch and turn into a skinny-fat , but why would I want to live my life that way ? Whereas that's what they do to turn into fat-fats , and then proceed to complain ( and brag ) on every social media site they have access to . Do something real about it I knew about dehydration and veins , but not sodium levels . I guess that would go along with other electrolytes as well ? You can even try this out for yourself w / regard to blood pressure - tighten a leather belt around your arm above your bicep ( near your armpit ) , and squeeze your fist . Watch those veins pop right out . Ha , drug addict <NUMBER> , I should have put that together . In regards to bf % , of course that makes sense , I'm an idiot . Women ( for the most part ) are not angular , because we're naturally higher . You're right about having advantages , makes it easier . But the fatties complaining non-stop about their genetics and their inability to change anything makes me sick . Keep shitlording it up , and thanks again for all the info Edit - I think we're both on the same page now . Yes , genetics play a role . But there are multiple steps you can take to overcome them , as are there multiple reasons to use them as an excuse . It's the difference between not being a dickbag and taking the easy way out , or completely giving up on life .	EXP

1965	DotA2	Randoming is a great way to start learning all of the heroes because you're using so many different ones potentially . You learn their skills and that can help you know how to defend against them in future games too because you know what your enemies are capable of . However , randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions . My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful . You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different , but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team . You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it , but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming , just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all .

These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare . He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on , but according to this plan at least , he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see . After a few years of libertarian economics , I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left . The MiC gone , much of the bureaucracy shattered , corporate welfare a thing of the past , social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods ( free healthcare , free education , scandinavian model ftw ) On the other hand , in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities : the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors , and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire .

2204	uncensorednews	"This isn't a racist rant but the fact of the matter is blacks in America have completely lost their way Lol ok I mean there are no longer any vocal , prominent black leaders going on T . V . or media in any way denouncing violence Not true , you just made up shit to appease your own view of the world . You have people anywhere from Ben Carson to President Obama talk about issues in black communities , BLM all the time . [ not ] doing anything to really strenhen race relations in this country So what do you want them to do ? Let's see where the rest of your rant goes Kids like the black students screaming at their professor at Yale or these idiots at a Milo event or these wonderful Dartmouth kids or the countless other examples of this deplorable behavior , are the reason shit like this is going down in America today . Nice strawmanning . I could pull videos out of my ass of whites , conservatives , old people doing something stupid or nefarious .. will that advance my argument ? No . Learn to think . Race relations are degenerating and quickly , and the black community is more pissed off than they were in the 80s when there was such violence and such despair during the drug trade . I don't know if that about the 80s is true , but I agree things have gotten worse . But then these middle class blacks started going to University , being told by not only their black professors , but their white professors , that the system has been putting them down , and they believed it . So long as you refuse to understand what white privilege means and that it exists , you'll never get what that means . Whenever one tries to explain people like you , you just close up your mind and mutter "" muh sjws "" to no end . To make it as simple as possible : Black people - higher chance of being born in ghettos - lower chance of pulling forward . Black Lives Matter is the misguided Kylo Ren of the world , not realizing their battle has already been won . There is still traces of institutional racism left over , not to mention classical instances ( i . e . the KKK and such groups ) . However those are not as powerful as the poverty trap they encounter themselves in . But what's happened since the Civil Rights movement ? Black communities are worse than ever . Not even remotely true and you know it . The black graduation high school rate is horrendous , black on black crime is an enormous issue , blacks are responsible for more than half of the murders in the U . S . , the single motherhood rate in the black community is something like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> % Yes , that happens to people living in poverty traps . these kids have the balls to [ blame ] black the whites of the United states Blame goes to racism , not whites . We all know that classical and institutional racism is not as much of a problem as it was decades ago . We've slowly seeing improvements . You may have the occasional police officer not doing what's best , but that's not the point . The point is that blacks still continue to live in poverty and you can only blame the racial disparity on our history . They're where they are because of the sins of our ancestors . You have CNN selectively editing these idiots and showing it to their audience at dinner time , trying to convince people that there are crusaders out there against the riots - - when in reality all they can find are more blacks inciting violence . You have blacks calling for whites to get beat up and CSU offering segregated dorms to combat micro-aggression from white students . I mean - - the list goes on and on and on . These are just ones I've come up with off the top of my head that are fresh in my mind . But where are the prominent blacks speaking out ? Where are the Martin Luther Kings ? The closest things we have are guys like this who try to talk some sense into people , and what happens when he sits down with the president of the NAACP chapter in Compton and a "" preacher ? "" She calls him an Uncle Tom , white , an Oreo ... More strawmanning . Again , want me to pull out videos of whites inciting violence ? What would that prove ? Nothing , just like you proved nothing . You wanna prove African Americans are mostly violent ? Pull out some statistics . Learn to think . INB <NUMBER> you pull out crime statistics . Now we literally have blacks blocking streets , trashing neighborhoods , beating up white people , kidnapping and torturing people , and NO ONE WILL SAY ANYTHING . This is the same shit as what's going on with Muslims in Sweden and Germany , and what is it going to take for us to get real with each other ? Oh cool , can I use the Dylan Roof example to prove that ALL whites are RACISTS , DEPLORABLES ? Also nice of you to compare blacks in the US to Muslim foreigners in Europe - complete racist , inexcusable garbage . Don't worry though , that only proves you are racist , not your entire demographic . No one will say anything until there is literally a race war in the streets . There wont be . Your fantasies aren't reality . And where are the sports stars speaking out ? Where are the black entertainers speaking out ? I know you think very highly of celebrities but these aren't the people blacks look up to . They look up to President Obama and such , they love him and are extraordinarily proud of him ( sometimes to a fault , I admit ) The support for these Black Lives Matter terrorists from the Left and the SJWs and mainstream media is only adding fuel to the fire . Oh lawd . Protests and obscure Tumblr blogs history of institutionalized racism . If you care about any of this shit , arm yourself with some statistics like the ones I linked above TIL youtube videos = statistics The black community may need help . Let's elect a retarded President and have him stack his cabinet with donors , globalists and Goldman Sachs executives , that will help . Urban areas are shit right now , but that doesn't change the fact that there is a culture issue Urban issues , ghettos are the cause of the culture issues . If we reject globalists policies we will get closer to solving the issue but it might not be enough . But again , that wont happen under an administration run by globalists ."	EXP

2539	milliondollarextreme	Let me help you with something . Growing up , my parents got divorced when I was <NUMBER> . During that period , I lived with my mom and she sacrificed everything on her own to make sure I had a decent place to live and eat while getting through school . During this time I treated my mom like shit , wasn't thankful for what I had and was generally disrespectful to her . It will dawn on you as you get older that your mom is only doing what she knows best . She's trying , and even though she may not be as smart as you wish she was , she still hasn't given up on you and loves you unconditionally . Open up to your mom , and talk with her without ever raising your voice . Use a tactical vocabulary and persuasion techniques to solidify a conversation and ease a tense situation . When she gives you a moment to reflect on yourself and your behavior , don't take offense and get upset . Odds are you actually are being a douche to your mother and you don't realize it . When I was your age I said some terrible shit to my mother that haunts me to this day . I can still see and feel the raw emotion emitting from my moms soul ; she couldn't believe her own son could treat her so bad . Now I'll admit moms are not easy to reason with , specially single moms who aren't up to par with intellecutal standards of a teenager . But before you go throwing words about your mom , Imagine her calling you one last time as she's impaled in her driver seat from a truck wreck to call and say she loves you . And for the rest of your life , the one person you've known the longest in your life will be gone forever . And the only memories you will have of being younger with your mom will be rude sentiments and horrid verbal abuse .	EXP

2633	hockey	"I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement : "" In short , it is illegeal specifically ...

However , in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted , the circumstances of the hit , including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable , can be considered . While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options , it is easier said than done . When you're on the ice , things are moving a lot faster - - it's part of the reason I was ( eventually ) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit . In my opinion , Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident . I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should ( also ) be based on your actions , not your intentions ; however , I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate ( illegal ) hit . Also , I agree that McQuaid should have responded . Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless . After all , if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again , it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it .

2663	Christianity	how can the person giving you the test , give you fair grading ? This is kind of a bad anology . God is not test us , but allowing us to use our free will as we want . The bible says the majority will miss use it , only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it . Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly ( because we may not know it ) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent . Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off . Can you say for sure they dont know better ? I cannot , because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good , and punished for doing bad . They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing . But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect , he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected . John <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> and Acts <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected . God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance . At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live . If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road . So lets take your view on the after life here , hopefully i got it right . You say the sinners die / loose their concient , as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life . The bible is clear from the start . God original purpose was for man to live on the earth forever . Ps <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth . Rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> says death will be done away with , Isiah <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> confirms death will be swallowed up . This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift . Death is the opposite of life . so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings ? Please have a read of rev <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> . This talks about things After armageddon , with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad . People are resurrected , brought back to perfection in mind and body , there will be no more sin in us . We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do . Like I said above those who still want to disobey will be judged and removed forever .	NOT

They use emotional blackmail on us early on to set their control . In my case , there was always a little of that growing up - but not as much as from some people I have met . Probably because my whole life my mother was the chosen slave - I was only used for small tasks when she was ( rarely ) out of the house shopping or whatnot . Nobody expected her to die first - especially my father since she was fit and <NUMBER> years his junior . But fate has a way of throwing you a monkey wrench sometimes . And you could see the panic that set in on him when she was sick . The sicker she got , the more he tried to demand from her - he wanted to get every last drop of precious servitude he could before she was gone . During her chemo and radiation , she had lost so much weight , was sick as a dog - and he'd be screaming at her to hurry up and stop puking because he needed his breakfast . This was the reason we relocated home from living abroad - I had heard what he was doing from family members and I could hear it on the phone when I talked to her . So I immediately came over and played "" blocker "" and assumed the food slave role - so she could have relief . He didn't care WHO was serving him , just as long as he was being served .

That is of course to be expected , but what isn't is his wildly shifting switch between rate of earnings compared to number of patrons , at which this month Patrons overtook earnings for the first time . That said , both have essentially plateaued and not exceeded ( yet , admittedly ) the highest amount from the month previous . Whats worse , and this is where knowing how users on Patreon behave comes in handy , Dax saw a big dropoff in earnings BEFORE the end of the month last month . That means many patrons , realizing another pay day was coming , purposefully pulled their pledges to stop this from happening . I'm thankful they did , because a few of those pledges then went to me , but that is beside the point . The usual dropoff you see is at the end of the month , because patron pledges decline or their info was put in wrong , so I am ignoring those drops . But last month multiple people purposefully dropped their pledges , and according to the numbers it looks like they did not come back . I guess all the ads Dick has been putting on Facebook worked slightly and brough over a few new patrons , but they are spending less than the patrons in previous months , and that is likely because they aren't the "" hot goss "" fueled patrons from before who finally are quitting .

3245	sjwhate	"So much of this has to do with people being insecure in themselves and wanting to be different and unique . They dye their hair funny colours , get extreme and aggressively out of the norm hair styles , lots of piercings and tattoos . I bet it starts like "" i need attention , I'll dye my hair , oh and I've gained some weight but a new age haircut will make people less on that . Oh and well all my friends have nose rings and piercings so i should do that . I'm also vegan and gluten free now . Meat is murder . Occupy Wall Street Black lives matter , and White people are literal hooman filth because I'm feeling guilty about what my ancestors did even though I'm so far removed from them that i would be OK with blacks enslaving me for a while as compensation . Oh look a new trend of being transgendered is cool so I'm transgendered i suppose and how dare you insult my rights . Being "" fat "" is just as healthy as being skinny stop fat shaming and mansplaining you cis scum . Dude most of those people looked attractive and very normal at first . It's incredible how low self esteem / need for validation will take you to such extremes . This is how you get SJW's , neo nazis , hell , even drug addicts . You're not born with a needle in your hand or a pink undercut . You surround yourself with these people and after enough time the constantly being around it normalizes it all and you join slowly but surely . With enough pressure and enough time just about anyone will become any one of these labels that are floating out there . It's a self feeding cycle . Who can be more extreme than then precessor . We see it often with religion as well . For example in Judaism you can't have milk and meat when the Bible says no calf in its mother's milk because that's a shitty thing to do so be cool guys . Then someone was like , well that means any beef with any milk . Then someone is like no way its all meat with any dairy producing animal . Then someone is like yo even though chickens don't make milk you can't have chicken with milk because it's now meat and you can't have meat with milk . We went from don't be cruel to don't eat milk with meat all because every important Jewish figure along the way decided to be more extreme with their rules than the previous person . We see the same thing happening with feminism . At first it was a movement to give women an equal playing field . Now it turned into bringing down the white man . They actually hate on white ( usually middle or higher class ) people for the color of their skin ( but let's be real it's often about being male and / or wealthy ) which by definition is racism but turns out you cannot be racist against white people . Any person hating a type of people based on their skin or culture heritage is racism . If you hate Jim from the office because he's a cunt , that's a different story but you don't hate him because he's a white guy , that's racism . The point is though , feminism was a great concept at first . Get women treated better , equal pay and benefits , etc . Then it turned into , well men have ruled the world for two millennia so it's our turn and let's take some power , and then all of it and tell them everything is their fault while simultaneously doing things that are just as bad as what they did , or even doing things we are criticising white men of doing . Eventually feminism turned into a gender study somehow and merged with LGBT issues , normalizing it all which is great , if you're gay and born that way , whatever dude glad you can get married and that you're happy , we are all people together . But then it turned into a cool thing to be bisexual or transgendered and people are deciding that they are so deeply gay that they need to be the other sex . I absolutely think many people are actually trans , being very feminine boy or masculine girl since childhood or being born with unidentifiable gender , etc . But a large part of LGBT is that a regular joe shmoe ​ surrounds himself neo feminists and the LGBT crowd because they are nice and fun to be around at first and after enough time , he loses the rest of his friends and only has these type of friends and they say being LGBT is the only acceptable way to be a man anymore , otherwise you're guilty of what your ancestors did but if your LGBT your not part of the problem anymore you're the victim So you somehow swing the LGBT thing and grow to like it and it spirals out of control and soon enough you're on hormones . None of this is meant to say that lots or most LGBT people are not genuinely gay / trans / whatever , or that all feminists are bad , I'm just saying that's it's very easy to indoctrinate people when you successfully shove your mantra down their throats on the daily basis . That's how we got Nazi Germany , and that's how we got <NUMBER> USA ."	EXP

3329	MensRights	When men can become impregnated , carry a baby to term , and give birth - we may have reproductive equality . Until then , biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible . All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent . I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights under this one circumstance : which is , if the child is her's because it's in her body , then it's her's after birth as well . If a father feels like ditching the kid , it's now his right because it didn't come from his body , and until men can give birth , they don't need to take responsibility for kids . Again , I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent . If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body , then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body . If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies , then women can't force men to take care of their children . If you don't agree with this , then tell me how you're being logically consistent . That is , how can you apply the logic to women , but not to men .	NOT

3497	milliondollarextreme	"I'm just gonna talk about World Peace now because it has been aired on the television . Yeah I agree that it isn't always ha ha funny like your usual entertainment-comedy-laugh-generating-show and MDE doesn't really use the same methods for generating laughter within you in the same way as other entertainment producers . As I see it mainstream comedy producers will have writers sitting in a room discussing and planning how they can design entertainment that will make the audience laugh with their fabricated joke-lines . They create what they think will make you laugh that is , and often just not being passionate in the creating but copying other entertainment producers methods so they can sell entertainment that is satisfying enough for the same type of audience . The difference between this type of comedy and MDE , I think , is that MDE creates what they themselves think is funny snd sometimes they will use like internal jokes that is not relatable to all , but the whole thing is more real in a sense and more relatable . I felt like a real human being when I watched World Peace and when I'm watching like Two and a Half Men ( or John Oliver etc . ) I'm feeling like a consumer or slave to a certain type of scheme or way of thinking . So yeah I think what MDE does is meaningful and generative in this sense that it is original and doesn't pander to any specific scheme or typical comedy methods designed for business and cheap laughs , and maybe this is related to why they chose the name "" World Peace "" because the content of the show , besides the fun and creative works , gives you a sense of not being a bitch or slave to a certain type of scheme or way of thinking . Maybe ur friend doesn't like MDE comedy becaused it doesn't tell him when to laugh which leaves him with a void and feeling of confusion but this is what some like with MDE too ."	EXP

3564	skyrim	For whatever reason , magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective . As you get to higher and higher levels , and start fighting really strong enemies , you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at . Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage ( one handed , two handed , etc . ) and you can constantly improve your weapons , further increasing your ability to deal damage . Mages can't do that , there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage . Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily , but as you level up so do your enemies . Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up . The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage . There is no equivalent for mage's , so when the average health of your enemies goes from <NUMBER> up to <NUMBER> + , your only option is to cast a higher quantity of spells rather than improving the quality of damage those spells do . Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka . The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill , say a high level dragon , is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment . Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire / lightingbolts / spell of choice while backing away from your enemies . It is still an easy enough build , but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while . It really feels like your spamming , as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills . Just my opinion , I have a high elf mage character . He's fun to use , but I get sick of it after a bit . At then end of the day though , I get sick of my stealth character too . My two cents , just play whichever combat type you think is fun , and focus more on picking a role within the game . Go be a rebel and focus on that , instead of focusing on maximizing your stats . Its way more rewarding to just play the game , rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS . A good way to avoid these troubles is split one	NOT

If you are , then you're golden . Yes there are hills . There are routes so that you can avoid the worst of the hills for either lights or rain . If all else fails , there's a great bus system in place . I'm still pretty much a fair weather rider , but I've been out a bunch of times since I got my endorsement last month . Even several times this week . I got rained on once , but I have waterproof gear , so I didn't care , other than being my first time in the rain . The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists . At least I haven't noticed a problem yet . But even when driving I like Seattle drivers . However , we moved from NC three years ago where you need to develop a sixth sense against the idiocy of driving there . So anywhere seems tame and normal after that for <NUMBER> years . People use turn signals here to indicate a turn . Other drivers see that and respect it . There are far fewer tailgaters here . The pace is generally much much slower , about the speed limit rather than <NUMBER> mph above it . The roads are noisier , though . There are quite a few Seattleites over on / r / motorcycles . So you can pose your question there and get a much more rider centric view on it . I haven't ridden anywhere else , but I like riding here .

3665	movies	I really like where this discussion is going . What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them . Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film . All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional . The more you study film , the more you will find that there is really nothing new . In other words , I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll , in the style of the old adventure serials , you will get ten similar results . To put it yet another way , I think that , given enough time , you can take any short sequence from any film , and make a mash-up just like this using <NUMBER> different films that came before it . All it would take is a lot of time and patience . This does not say anything about the creativity ( or lack thereof ) of the filmmaker . This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last <NUMBER> years of film making , and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made . Edit : One more thing I would like to mention : Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage . Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> , not what looks like something closer to <NUMBER> . <NUMBER> : <NUMBER> ( which was more common in early movies ) . Meaning , even the footage from Raiders has been altered to more closely resemble the footage on the right .	NOT

He's the largest figure in modern day right-wingery only to children like you , he doesn't exist outside of reddit and r / The_Douchebag circle-jerk . That's not "" jouralism "" it's info-tainment , and at that point you're the one who's off topic because you're posting about being worried about getting a real job because you secretly want to be a conservative puppet which is the opposite of actual reporting . If you want to go beat off to the idea that all foreigners / muslims hate gay people , while simultaneously telling me that conservatives seriously support gays when your poster girl Kim Davis sits in jail because she won't even follow "" The Law "" , go ahead , but don't think you're fixing anything by joining the problem , or refusing to accept the fact that republicans have been the source of the problem that created a need for the people who flock to a bullshit feminist movement to right the wrongs they put in place over the last <NUMBER> years . The only reason Milo can exist today is because someone who'd you probably call an SJW in the <NUMBER> ' s or <NUMBER> ' s stood up for the rights of someone like him to be allowed to do whatever the fuck it is you think he does today . As if Ragen was calling AIDS a gay disease in <NUMBER> and then decided to bring them into his cabinet in <NUMBER> . It didn't work that way , and the fact that you don't have a problem with gays isn't due to some divine miracle , it's because a lot of people had to fight to put anti-discrimination laws in place to make sure it doesn't happen . You keep telling me that "" not all conservatives are religious , anti-science , blah blah blah "" , but then lump anyone who's for human rights as a SJW . If you don't want me to make your party out to be an anti-science , fundamentalist group of retards you should take your own advice and stop thinking that Liberals are the source of SJW bullshit . It's the same type of donors that fund the likes of Palin and Bachman that fund an Obama or a Hillery , but it's not the law that you're even pissed about . We're pissed because all this shit gets taken too far . There's a huge push back now to bring back free speech , but there's a difference fighting the problem and countering the bullshit with bigger bullshit . SJW's need to be called on their logical fallacies . As for why you'd ever consider taking an immigrant from one of those countries ; have you ever heard of Bill Maher ? He brings people on his show from those countries who want to get rid of those governments . You bring in people from those countries to save them from those countries . A gay person get's thrown off a build in Syria and you don't think that person wouldn't rather come here and live their life freely ? That they love the government that allows that to happen ? You're saying a <NUMBER> % of all the people that hit the ground from their <NUMBER> story drop thought , "" well this sucks but at least I'm not in America "" ? You bring them here so they become an advocate for your way of life and show the world it's possible to change it . That's why he brings them on his show , and that's how you make a change . Like the one that benefited fuck-face Milo's existence . Again , you're right , if you want to be a fanboy for the ones who have been destroying the world one piece at a time , such that they created the fucking SJW movement in the first place .. knock yourself out . I'd rather fix the problem . Good luck with your info-tainment career . BTW , I highly recommend you watch some George Carlin , or Bill Hicks , if for nothing else than to understand what the past was like - because just claiming that "" everything's fine now , gays and blacks aren't an issue "" because you weren't alive or paying attention to the thing's that happened before ... isn't a valid excuse to get your points across ."

He tried going to the club , and tried gay dating apps for three years , and it never worked for him . Gay "" dating "" apps like Grindr aren't for dating : they're for hooking up . And there's a hookup culture at gay clubs as well . Even with a good , warm personality , and good looks , you're most likely not going to be finding a nice , loving relationship in those venues . It ’ s more often about seeing who you can have sex with , having sex , then seeing who else you can have sex with : objectification . When this story first broke , I almost immediately thought “ internalized homophobia . ” But as this story unfolds , I see someone who can ’ t reconcile his strict upbringing , with actual gay dating , or gay hookup culture . Everyone seemed to be having fun at the gay club and meeting each other — except for him . Every time he went , hundreds of shirtless men were laughing , dancing , grinding , yet he sat in the corner due to poor socialization , and his inability to adapt , and drank . This massacre could be an instance of homophobia . It could be that he was angry that no one in the gay community liked him or wanted to date him because he couldn ’ t adapt to how to behave around , or converse with other gays effectively . He went to the club dozens of times , saw men objectifying each other , and perhaps became disillusioned and angry . Where was his love ? If he began to see the gay men as just objects , it would be easier to shoot them up . In his mind , if he ’ s a person , but no gay men ever liked him , they ’ re not people . Throwing in the ISIS thing towards the end being a way for him to accept that these evil things deserved to die .

3786	milliondollarextreme	Woah that looks fun , let me try : Great and manifold were the blessings , most dread Sovereign , which Almighty God , the Father of all mercies , bestowed upon us the people of England , when first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and reign over us . For whereas it was the expectation of many , who wished not well unto our Sion , that , upon the setting of that bright Occindental Star , Queen Elizabeth , of most happy memory , some thick and palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land , that men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk , and that it should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State ; the appearance of Your Majesty , as of the Sun in his strenh , instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists , and gave unto all that were well affected exceeding cause of comfort ; especially when we beheld the Government established in Your Highness , and Your hopeful Seed , by an undoubted Title ; and this also accompanied with peace and tranquillity at home and abroad . But among all of our joys , there was no one that more filled our hearts than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word among us , which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the riches of the earth ; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself , not only to the time spent in this transitory world , but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven . Then not to suffer this fall to the ground , but rather to take it up , and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your Highness did leave it ; nay , to go forward with the confidence and resolution of a man , in maintaining the truth of Christ , and propagating it far and near is that which hath so bound and firmly knit the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You , that Your very name is precious among them : their eye doth behold You with comfort , and they bless You in their hearts , as that sanctified Person , who , under God , is the immediate author of their true happiness . And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay , but every day increaseth and taketh strenh , when they observe that the zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go backward , but is more and more kindled , manifesting itself abroad in the farthest parts of Christendom , by writing in defence of the truth , ( which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be healed , ) and every day at home , by religious and learned discourse , by frequenting the house of God , by hearing the Word preached , by cherishing the teachers thereof , by caring for the Church , as a most tender and loving nursing father . There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and religious affection in Your Majesty ; but none is more forcible to declare it to others than the vehement and perpetuated desire of accomplishing and publishing of this work , which now , with all humility , we present unto Your Majesty . For when Your Highness had once , out of deep judgement , apprehended how convenient it was , that , out of the Original sacred Tongues , together with comparing of the labours , both in our own and other foreign languages , of many worthy men who went before us , there should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the English tongue ; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite those to whom it was commended , that the Work might be hastened , and that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner , as a matter of such importance might justly require . And now at last , by the mercy of God , and the continuance of our labours , it being brought unto such a conclusion , as that we have great hopes that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby , we hold it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty , not only as to our King and Sovereign , but as to the principal mover and author of the Work ; humbly craving of your most Sacred Majesty , that , since things of this quality have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented persons , it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as Your Highness is ; whose allowance and acceptance of our labours shall more honour and encourage us , than all the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us . So that if , on the one side , we shall be traduced by Popish persons at home or abroad , who therefore will malign us , because we are poor instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto the people , whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness ; or if , on the other side , we shall be maligned by self-conceited brethren , who run their own ways , and give liking unto nothing but what is framed by themselves , and hammered on their anvil , we may rest secure , supported within by the truth and innocency of a good conscience , having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity , as before the Lord , and sustained without by the powerful protection of Your Majesty's grace and favour , which will ever give countenance to honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and uncharitable imputations . The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy days , that , as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many singular and extraordinary graces , so You may be the wonder of the world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity , to the honour of that great God , and the good of his Church , through Jesus Christ our Lord and only Saviour .

4144	fatpeoplehate	"I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with a ham and I will try to explain the circumstances that brought me there in order to help you get through to your sister . I was emotionally beaten down by life at the time . I was a teenager , had an abusive dad and a very unhealthy home life which I felt I was uneffected by ( looking back this was inaccurate . ) My dad was a shitlord , but also abusive and my impression of his personality was very negative . I wanted to be all that he wasn't so accepting others regardless of appearance or status was very important to me at that time . When I met the ham I was blind to fitness level thanks to my accept everyone disposition . I'd always been "" nerdy "" and not great at sports and I think that influenced my leniency on fitness . I'd also just broken up with my boyfriend because he had totally bailed on plans we made to go away for some time in the summer because he was afraid to leave home and I was pretty much disgusted by the lack of balls . So when I met the ham out on my adventure he immediately had points because he was at least there and seemed confident . Turns out he lied about a lot of things and was able to convince me that he was independent , health oriented and a peaceful open minded person . I was under the impression that he had good qualities and that we were similar in our world view . ( Nit at all . ) At first he was very nice to me , then he iced me out , which made me feel insecure and like I'd done something wrong ( a common pattern with emotionally abusive people . ) So this friendship continued this way for a few years and when I graduated high school I moved away to college . That's when he changed the way he acted toward me big time . He started harassing me with calls and texts all the time , constantly needing attention and expressing undying love for me . I found it really weird and annoying . My problem is that I'm too polite about boundaries . I tried to tell him nicely that I didn't want a close relationship like he was pushing for and he would cry , whine and generally beg me not to stop speaking to him . I felt bad so I entertained his texts and calls for a long long time . He got offended that I had boyfriends . He would criticize them , me , my clothes , my food choices , my personality , so many things . And still I didn't hold him accountable . Then I lost a parent to a preventable disease . As I worked through my grief he was even more obsessive , domineering , and passive aggressive . Suddenly everything clicked , hard . I realized he was a disgusting glutton and a bully . I realized that I was accepting that type of behavior in my life and made a change immediately . I cut him out and I laid down my rules very firmly . This was about <NUMBER> years ago . We have contact still and he tries to pull the same whiny bullshit but it doesn't affect me anymore . I feel no sympathy or guilt . I realize that his problems are his own and I need to do what's healthiest for me . It took me getting free of my abuser and learning to truly love myself in the aftermath to overcome my codependency issues . I was being emotionally manipulated and it is possible your sister is too . Talk to her . Ask her what she likes about him . For me it was that we talked about everything ( we were unhealthily close ) and he was kind to me ( when it didn't entail any true effort on his part of course . ) But something changed in me and made me see that the way he treats himself and me were not healthy . If someone can't love and care for themselves they certainly can't do it in a relationship . She needs to figure this out . Whether it's through you , or her own experiences it is important you support her as an individual . Make sure she's still taking "" me time "" to develop her own character and sense of self . I suspect this is a self esteem issue . She doesn't realize that she deserves better . She should be with someone who cares for themselves and is capable of being caring toward another person .. sometimes you learn that from other relationships , and sometimes you have to teach yourself . FPH helped me stay strong . If and when she breaks up with him be sure to show her this sub . It's a great reminder of their behavior and tactics being unacceptable .

4379	DebateAnAtheist	"I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying "" nah , just communism . "" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force . It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state , or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force . What matters here is that Stalin , inheriting the political legacy of Marx , used state violence to advance atheism because he believed ( or at the very least pretended to believe ) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint . My response to the OP , again , is that we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism , but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it easier to justify atrocities by ' raising the stakes ' . That is to say , it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale . The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism , but rather with personal power or ' communism as opposed to atheism ' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive , not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general . Regarding the fallacy of division , I am not saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism . No , he did not wake up and say , "" hey , let's starve some Ukrainians today ... FOR ATHEISM !

Yes , and I share a lot of genetic information with people from Norway - - that doesn't mean I share any significant cultural values with Norwegians or even any identifiable characteristics , as an American , with Norwegian citizens . Is my character "" imprinted "" with the national character of Scandinavia , or am I more a product of the circle of American culture in which I've grown up ? What I take from the AAA statement is that trying to understand some underlying cultural values of someone based on "" race "" or physical characteristics is absurd . Does an African-American share the same values or inherent character of someone from Ethiopia simply because they are both descended from Sub-Saharan African people ? They're probably more "" similar "" to the "" white "" guy that lives in the next neighborhood over than someone of their supposed "" race . "" If race exists as an underlying quality of intelligence and moral character , why do so many Sub-Saharan African immigrants succeed in the US educational system when their "" racial "" counterparts don't ? To me , that suggests a cultural problem within the US rather than an underlying problem of "" race , "" because you would expect all people of a "" race "" to behave according to their inherent moral character rather than according to the environment in which they were raised ( i . e . nature vs . nurture ) . Dude , no one is saying that we'd be living in a utopia if it weren't for immigrants - people just don't want to be importing populations with higher rates of violence than the natives . Suppose I'm an American moving to England - - how absurd would it be for people in England say , "" Well look at the incidences of sexual assault among the white American population . Obviously , white Americans value sexual assault in their culture . "" Or say that an English person was moving to America , and I were to say , well the BBC covered up sex crimes , therefore this British person must be a sexual deviant . Cultures don't get together at a meeting and say , "" Well let's commit such-and-such crimes . "" Confusing what some segment of the population does with the ability of human beings to develop a moral code is absurd . Sam Hyde specifically picked out Rotherham as evidence that immigrants are likely to increase the rate of sex crimes in England - - which is about as sensible as saying that the native English population increases the rate of sex crimes in England because there have been sex rings within native groups . Most English natives would be disgusted by Jimmy Savile and most Pakistani people would be disgusted by Rotherham . Yes , there are immigrants from countries where there is organized crime - - but it's not as though saying that if you emigrate from Japan you're likely to be a member of the Yakuza or if you emigrate from Italy you're likely to be a member of the Mafia , any more than if you're from Pakistan you're sympathetic to al-Qaeda . Thirdly , the arguments Sam Hyde makes are not exactly new , and <NUMBER> years ago they probably would have put him outside of the norm if he wasn't <NUMBER> % descended from English ancestors , preferably if they came over on the Mayflower . German-Americans were seen as sympathetic to their home country during WW1 and WW2 , and because a small segment of the Italian population was sympathetic to Anarchist causes , Italian immigrants were lynched . This isn't even getting into how Irish or Jewish immigrants were treated . Many Jewish refugees were turned away from the US when Hitler was in power , and ended up in concentration camps . I'm sure a lot of US citizens didn't want the "" burden "" of immigrants "" diluting "" American culture then , either ."	EXP

4540	Fitness	Stalling early , how early depends on the lift , is often because of not eating enough and , secondly , from bad form . The press , for one , will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small . The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments . These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon . As for the squat and deadlift , those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are ' done ' with SS . Either way , the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there . This is doubly true for the upper body lifts . Conditioning will inhibit strenh training . There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable ; however , that does not mean one should not do some conditioning . Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strenh training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning . You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation .

While these instances of "" whites "" being enslaved and murdered by "" blacks "" may make sense without context , it's important for you to understand the context behind Peterson's work , and his intentions . The white color of many of the victims in Cleon's large scale works such as the Paris mural is meant to symbolize the purity and innocence behind those characters , and the black color is meant to symbolize the brutality and sin in those characters . I know that a lot of times in this sub , we may jump at the chance to paint anyone as an SJW , but I really think that Peterson is just making an observation about humanity as a whole , not specific races .

I'm kind of surprised that you got rubbed really wrong about my blog post where I followed down that line of thinking , but it was actually me thinking through my own reaction at the time . I hope I didn't come across like I was bitching about my friends as if we were sitting together at a cafe like I can't get over it . The situation was cause for thought for me and I thought it was cause for thought for others allowing an interesting discussion to open up . I'm unsure about your advice to : Instead of telling your friends to completely stop , you could have just as easily used what your friends were doing to give value to the entire restaurant . You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people . Perhaps I need to clarify , but the example I use in my article is happening in a sushi restaurant . It irritated me that my friends were acting out in a classy establishment . I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance , but in any case , it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person , in fact , part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values .

4658	worldnews	I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally . If it has any medical merit , it is simply a species of Tylenol given , a financial decision made with humans as stock , as money , because it's cheaper . Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan , too . Human life is incalculable , the $ 60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace , diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one . The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual : if you are in a hole , stop digging . The suffering is a result of human choice , weakness , arrogance , greed , folly . Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - know that they are crackheads . Really . True story . This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts . Sophistry , milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity , and politics - in a word , human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction . Fracture that central concept any way you wish , you still have a piece of the same pie . Please downvote me further , or if you can , expose the falsity of what I say . Puerile ingrates are the result of same . These people need help , and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering . Enter any store in the neighbourhood ; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold , in some cases openly . A wee rose in a glass tube , other ' glassware ' . It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one : the net result to the crack user is exactly the same . Think about that and rebut it , because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in ; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction , into deepened and not lessened misery , as they walk the common road to death multifarious .

4682	islam	What guarantee do I have that the woman I will marry would be right for me ? I think the problem stems from two different notions of marriage . I assume you were raised in the West , so your notion of marriage is very different from a more conservative and traditional idea of marriage . You are looking for a life partner it sounds . In a traditional marriage , you typically marry one of the people your parents choose . That's where the conflict arises . If you held to a traditional notion of marriage , then you just let your parents know you want to get married , then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts . The concept of ' right for me ' doesn't exist in that set up , it's more of ' right for both families ' .	NOT

4877	uncensorednews	"You can't just pick and choose what you believe in . I make assumptions based on history , check them against reality and adjust whatever I read . Which includes stats . Since I know the US government is desperate to paint whites as bad and non-whites as good I know they'll do sneaky stuff like Where'd you get that ratio ? Can you provide a link please ? It's an estimate based on the FBI states and adjusted for behavior . How can you say that hate crime against blacks is justifiable ? I'm saying that the majority of supposed hate crimes against blacks aren't actual hate crimes but self defense , revenge or that sort of thing . Whereas a ton of black crime against whites are hate crimes but not classified as such , because the authorities will only do so if there's absolutely incontrovertible evidence racial hatred was the motive . Recall that white kid got tortured by chimps screaming fuck whites ? They tried at first to claim it wasn't a hate crime and then it was a hate crime against the handicapped . That's likely typical . Was Dylan Roof justified in murdering those innocent black families that were simply attending church ? Since those black families likely defends and aids the sort of monkey I linked to torturing an old lady I don't have all that much sympathy for them . By your logic , hate crime against whites is much more justifiable because blacks have suffered so much more over the years . The primary cause of black suffering is black dysfunction . That is , they victimize each other and themselves with their stupidity and impulsivity . Just because something is seen more often on the media ( which isn't true ) doesn't mean it's real , there are many crimes committed that aren't recorded so don't think that just because you see more black violence online it means that's how it is irl . That's my point . White crimes is overrepresented by a factor of <NUMBER> in media reporting and black crime massively under reported . Compare Omar Thornton and Dylann Roof and how much coverage each got . You should've learned to not believe everything you see on the internet , it caters to what you want to see . Trust me , I don't want to see white people getting tortured . Where'd you get that it takes <NUMBER> white families to support one black family ? That's the ratio of the tax surplus generated by whites and the tax drain generated by blacks . On average whites net contribute something like $ 100k over a life time and blacks net consume something like $ 500k . Link ? And you do realize that not all black people live on welfare ? There are many well self supporting black families , just as there are many white families on welfare as well . Pretty sure most blacks actually do get welfare . And of those that do have jobs a huge percentage wouldn't have gotten them except for legally mandated discrimination in their favor . That is , they're not real jobs but wealth transfers from whites in exchange for them doing subpar job or simply pretending to be working . Even though this country's history has a trend of trying their hardest to make black peoples ' lives difficult . If that were true there wouldn't exist any blacks in the US . There have been people who truly felt that way . Which is way there are no blacks in Arab countries , despite Arabs taking far more black slaves than whites ever did . The difference is the Arabs castrated their slaves and killed them as soon as they weren't useful , whereas whites helped their slaves and cared for them . Like I said , if whites had merely left American blacks to fend for themselves , rather than supporting them through welfare and that sort of thing , <NUMBER> % of them would starve to death . I'm not saying that the kkk go around murdering people , as far as we know , but it's disgusting that they are still around because of the values that that group was built on The KKK was founded to protect Southern whites against Northern and black violence during reconstruction . That's a noble and good thing . The Dylan Roof shooting was not a huge thing because it was "" rare "" , it was huge because he killed many innocent people , including a pastor and state senator . Simply not true . Omar Thornton killed about as many . But all that happened was that the media tried to paint his victims as racists who had it coming and then dropped the whole thing . FFS a year or two ago a black guy murdered a white reporter and her cameraman on live television and the story was buried .

We cuddled a bit while she told me the backstory . Walked her to her room after a while . Unrelated epilogue ; I learned later my GF had accepted a marriage proposal from some other guy and was hoping I'd hook up with yet a different houseguest . I was OK with all that , but I wasn't OK with her wanting to continue having sex with me after she was engaged .	NOT

4902	pics	"Congratulations , you corrected me ! Now argue with me about things that actually matter . You're asserting that being convinced of something that isn't true while being drunk is robbery , in an effort to equate that with a lack of ability to consent . This argument falls apart when considering that that same scenario is just as illegal if it would happen to a sober person while , once again , this is not true of consensual sex . Have you ever been drunk ? Just a question . Yes , actually , I have been blackout drunk before . There's a reason I don't drink anymore . And , as is right , I take full responsibility for all of my actions while drunk .  ... and consent is massively abrogated in a drunken context . No , judgement is impaired , but not consent . We don't allow sober people with poor judgement to claim rape when anybody has sex with them , why does this suddenly magically change with drunk sex ? "" I was being stupid . "" is not a valid excuse for doing something stupid . No . Contract law is quite relevant ... You engage in a contract whenever you agree to do something with another person . I'm sorry , but you're wrong . If you get drunk and somebody convinces you to give them everything you own ( by just asking for it , not by lying to you ) , then you can't go back later and force them to give it back . You could try to sue , but you'd be laughed out of court ."	NOT

4963	europeannationalism	"Thanks for sharing . I don't have the time to address everything you wrote so I've selected a few paragraphs that stood out to me . Here's what I think IS real : European history and culture is rich , varied , powerful , beautiful , sadistic , noble , messy , free-thinking , oppressive , liberating . It's all of the above . Whiteness intersects and intertwines with that cultural timeline , meaning different things to different people in different eras , and though I'm sure we could argue that forever , that's not really what you're interested in . Your idea of "" whiteness "" is the one seen through the lens of modernity , standing in contrast to Africans , West Asians , East Asians , Middle-Easterners , Pacific Islanders , etc . , sometimes including Hispanics , sometimes not , sometimes including Jews , sometimes not . But even with that messy definition , I believe there is still enough of a cultural identity that can be discussed . and traitorous strategies are heavily disadvantaged when compared to both ethnocentrism and humanitarianism . Neither race nor cultural separation are required for groups of humans to attack one another , and the more you seek to separate yourselves , the more likely it is your children will inherit those divisions and fight among themselves . Even if you limit European history to just the "" white "" portions , there was plenty of suffering . Racial purity scapegoats the underlying psychological flaws we ALL share as a species , and even if Hitler had his way and the world was repopulated solely by beautiful white babies ... do you really think that will prevent conflict and in-fighting even a hundred years later ? Humans will gladly invent differences out of thin air to justify otherization and violence . Of course we can never completely eliminate violence and suffering . Surely we should at least attempt to minimise conflict , though ; I see no better way of doing that than separating the races into homogeneous groups , letting in-group preferences play out in a semi-productive way and reaping the benefits of a relatively high trust society where everyone is "" like me "" with a shared purpose and goals . Forcing lots of racial groups together is a recipe for disaster because it results in low trust societies with constant tension and jockeying for power ( i . e . social dysfunction ) above and beyond the individualistic conflict that exists in homogeneous racial groups . If you're interested , you can also have a quick look at some of the links in the sidebar listed under "" Diversity and ethnocentrism facts "" to get a better idea of what I'm talking about ."	EXP

5336	sjwhate	"I mean yeah sure but I don't think the problem here is that they shredded a printing of the Constitution . Rather than actually talking to these kids about why its "" triggering "" or "" oppressive "" and how they can deal with it ( or at least sending them to someone who can ) they just immediately start nodding their heads and blindly agreeing to anything to give the kids what they want . You can see both the younger Administrator suppressing a smile and laughter at the end at how ridiculous what she's doing is and the older lady ( smiling uncomfortably even more visibly ) puts up her hands like she wants to talk about something ( probably whether or not the "" student's "" concerns matter or not ) but instead she just silences herself and does whatever the student asks . That lack of communication and doing anything to appease these adults as if they're crying children is either what they're trained to do in their jobs or conditioned to do by the culture they feel is surrounding the sociopolitical ideals of the school and / or the country as a whole as the school feels it should relate to . In either case its at the very least negligence and at worst actively appeasing a mentally-ill person in lieu of suitable treatment . Is it up to the school administrators to shred the constitution with you ? I really don't think so . They should discuss why its triggering and if the student is unwilling to discuss that recommend them to a therapist who can because they might have bigger problems . Triggers should be managed and if these are some kind of special triggers that need the rest of the world to appease them then they should rename them rather than trying to define the already well-established terminology of what a psychological trigger is . Its not a school's job to coddle and appease its students more than their parents already have , its their job to challenge them intellectually and manage their concerns regarding schooling . If they have a personal problem , they need to referred to someone then confer with that person as to how the school can work with their issue . A Director of Equal Opportunity shouldn't be bending over backwards for something that's "" triggering "" because its a psychological problem , which is well outside her area of expertise . But the fact they immediately did without hesitation shows there's a sort of unbeatable power behind the word "" triggering "" or "" oppressing "" beyond its original context , at least to Colleges which , for the majority , are undoubtedly far left swinging . Those words don't need conversation , treatment , or analysis they simply mean the person who says them needs appeased rather then treated or questioned or else you are a "" problematic "" or "" oppressive "" person , whether the inspiration for the "" triggering "" or "" oppression "" is real or not . When your job and reputation is on the line you'll become a slave for those words and any explanation given to you , no matter how illogical , you will run with because the endgame is that you're not a problematic or oppressive person . The payoff really isn't that you're a good person , because you could still screw up by having the wrong opinion at any time . But more that you are NOT a problematic or oppressive person and thats enough that you can continue to stay on your toes without getting knocked down . TL ;D R These weren't the right administrators to handle something psychological like something "" triggering "" . The fact that they immediately complied with anything without working through the root of the cause of the "" trigger "" shows the word has unreal and unreasonable power because people don't want labels attached to them that could damage their reputation , earn them viral harassment , and cause them to lose their job .

5704	DotA2	Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry . The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase , which disrupts their attack animation canceling ( right phrase ? ) and decreases the time the enemy spends inside the cloud . You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety . Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads . I also prioritise backstab over blink strike . Before level <NUMBER> you often need to use blink strike to start a fight . Before level <NUMBER> blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able / need to use it more than once , especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible . At level <NUMBER> max backstab provides about <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> extra damage per attack ( before buff ) . SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security . Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables . Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early , while both tier <NUMBER> towers are up , limiting the mobility .	NOT

5706	pics	"few facts , rather than quoting unnecessarily and extensively Granted from wikipedia , but the article is accurate , well-sourced and conservative . I selected it for succinctness and readability . But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only "" facts "" off the top of my head ... Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb : Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes . The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems . The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems , including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life . Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity . Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play . The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march . This first factor is likely to kill off <NUMBER> % of shellfish by the end of the century . This mass extinction , already in progress , will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches . In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches . Many humans , inland and coastal , depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities . Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die . This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes , such as top-soil removal , soil and water salinization , desertification and acid rain , thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population . These events are happening now . There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life , coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste . Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore . You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing , not decreasing . We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children , humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation"	NOT

Then that they have the nerve to complain about "" how nothing gets done "" is infuriating - He makes the case that "" the female body has a way of shutting down "" has the same effect as almost all the outlandish gun control statements floating about - I do believe he is slightly wrong on one thing ; That if anti-gun people were actually educated and had first hand knowledge , they would have a lot harder time being anti-gun . It's just hard to throw such nonsense around when you see them for what they are , metal , wood , plastic , and not for what the anti-gun side wants you to believe they are . Gun control groups THRIVE on this ignorance . No gun control group will ever recommend education on the topic . - The one issue I take with the article is it makes too much of an issue between left and right . Democrat and Republican . Guns are not a partisan issue for the American people - they're a partisan issue for politicians . There are plenty of anti-gun Republicans who don't trust good inner city law abiding people with guns , and plenty of pro-gun Democrats that don't want to vote for Hillary because of her extreme gun control ( really , people control ) views .

5964	fatpeoplehate	Nature won't stop obesity , only a global education intervention and food reform will . Natural selection is the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring . Natural selection is dead in modern humans due to the infrastructure and support systems we have in place . If you're sick we have doctors , surgeons , and medicine . If you're disabled or handicapped we have technology that allows one to live their lives closer to the norm . If you're poor you're provided free health care and food through welfare . We've extended the life expectancy of our species by making it damn hard for someone to die . Despite being unattractive , fat people will still always get fucked . You have the desperate , ugly , socially inept , and / or fat that simply can't do better . Fat people may want someone skinny and attractive but excluding finding a skinny chubby chaser , they will realize their place and eventually settle with someone who doesn't contrast their size and start a family . Obesity reduces life expectancy but not to the point where they won't reach an age where they can't produce offspring . Obese people tend to be poor and less educated . The poor and less educated tend to produce more offspring and have their children sooner in life . In that sense they are technically beating educated / skinny people on the natural selection front since they are living long enough to produce a greater quantity of offspring . Couple that with a lower life expectancy , the parents will die off at younger ages leaving their children with less education and resources to better their positions in life . Now their's stupid poor fat children that will grow up and repeat the cycle . HAES will eventually kill it self off and their supporters will turn on it the same way smokers did . The main figureheads might be healthy now , but in a few years / decades they will be in the ground . The ones that replace them will be in ground . The notion of HAES will be buried with them as they see their idols and role models dying at early ages . Those that were a part of the movement against movement will speak out in their dying years just like the Marlboro man realizing the error of their ways . This will only quell the uproar we're hearing from the loud fats currently , but it doesn't stop the problem . We haven't eradicated smoking , just lessened the impact , just stopped people from saying that it's not not healthy . There's millions of nonvocal fatties that aren't with the HAES movement but just can't be normal weight because they lack the willpower to be normal size or simply don't care . They sit in their car to get to work , they sit in their office at work , they sit in their car to get back home , and sit in their home watching tv all the while stuffing their face all day . They are addicts and food is their drug . Without proper education starting early in their lives and making unhealthy food more expensive harder to get , fatties will continue to be fat . Nature can't help . We are technologically way past that .	EXP

Furthermore , there are millions and millions of disgusting hambeasts out there setting up dates with unsuspecting shitlords .

The overwhelming majority of the members of the rich jew families , the ones we all have heard of , all got safe haven from the Holocaust either on the other side of the Ocean , or even within Europe ; After the world learned about what had happened with the Jews in the Third Reich , there has been a strong , official and unofficial , ban on any attempt at criticizing the Jewish religion , the artificial "" Jewish people "" , the even more artificial "" Jewish state "" , the even still more artificial "" Hebrew Language "" , the jewish families and any individual with known or presumed jewish ancestry . The taboo surrounding the criticism of anything with the "" Jew "" label is almost on par with the social taboo on "" incest "" ; What's more surprising , however , is that such "" tabooing "" was able to single handely undo centuries , perhaps , thousands of years of criticisms , legitimate and illegitimate , on Judaism and on its followers , be they individuals , families or groups . As a consequence , history had to be rewritten to omit any negative mention on anyone who might "" belong "" to the "" Jewish people "" , biographers had to distort their own works to omit any criticism to the "" Jewish people "" made by the biographed person , and any direct criticism at any belief or tenet of Judaism had to be partially rewritten , so that the reader is led to believe that the criticism is aimed towards Christianity , Islam or "" religion in general "" ( example : criticism on circumcision of infant males aims the highlight on some Protestant branch of Christianity , instead of aiming the hightlight towards Judaism ); Likewise , any negative criticism about anyone or any family / group with a "" Jewish seal "" , from the past or the present , is branded as a "" conspiracy theory "" , and anyone who dares to open his / her mouth about them is branded as a "" conspiracy theorist "" and he / she is officially / unofficially punished by the estabilishment and by anyone who fears it ; In the crazy aftermath of WW2 , the artificial "" Jewish people "" was able to persuade all the emergent world powers ( USA , UK , and USSR ) to give to them the infamous "" Promised Land "" , which led to the creation of the artificial "" Jewish State "" of Israel , with its semi-artificial "" Hebrew Language "" , founded on the principles of religious homogenity and a semi-racial homogenity , and they all agreed with the idea of gradually kicking out the native population that occupied the land "" belonged "" to Israel that did not pass the "" Jewish "" filter , a process that has been happening since its foundations , and will happen until the whole of "" Palestine "" is absorbed into Israel and its non-jewish populations are kicked ."

He was a popular football player from an unusually successful iteration of our school's football team . He had a lot of friends . As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation , there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends . I was <NUMBER> years old , and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers . It was a few inches above my knee . My hair was short and layered . I was wearing minimal makeup . While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up , the cut of them was not unusual for me at all . If anything , I typically wore shorter shorts . A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us . He seemed really interested in me , but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better . I was a very articulate kid , gregarious in spite of deep shyness , and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses ( my mom was a bus driver ) or games . An older boy talking to me was noteworthy , but I didn't really heed it . It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way , regardless of sex . I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time , I didn't heed it . I think it was Rich who ran out , his cap tilted on his head , and whispered something to his friend . They said they had to go line up and skittered off . Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it . I'm not sure .

6214	magicTCG	If you have any Swords of War and Peace , I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction . It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster , but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm . With Sword , every creature is a threat , whereas with True Conviction , you still need about <NUMBER> creatures in play for it to be effective . Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army , and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer / Geist Honored Monk . All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment , but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less . ( It also grows stronger each turn it attacks , which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk . ) If your metagame has lots of control decks , I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting . Being able to play a threat on their end step , then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything . They just don't have enough mana in the early game . Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish . He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards . I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters . If you can get them , adding <NUMBER> Razorverge Thicket and <NUMBER> more Gavony Township would be very powerful . So would a single Mikaeus , the Lunarch . He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township . ( The land really is THAT powerful . ) I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main . He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor , although both seem fine . First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks . A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment . Not too many , though ; it's a lot of mana , and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response . In any event , that's all I've got ! If you get the Razorverge Thickets , try adding a Garruk Relentless or two . Planeswalkers are ( almost always ) good .	NOT

6517	OperationPullRyan	Statement by the President on H . R . <NUMBER> : Today I have signed into law H . R . <NUMBER> , the “ National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <NUMBER> . ” I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad , crucial services for service members and their families , and vital national security programs that must be renewed . In hundreds of separate sections totaling over <NUMBER> pages , the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad , to build the security capacity of key partners , to modernize the force , and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide . The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it . In particular , I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention , interrogation , and prosecution of suspected terrorists . Over the last several years , my Administration has developed an effective , sustainable framework for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations , and the results we have achieved are undeniable . Our success against al-Qa ’ ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people , and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world . Against that record of success , some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe . My Administration has consistently opposed such measures . Ultimately , I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes , but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety , security , and liberty of the American people . Moving forward , my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded . Section <NUMBER> affirms the executive branch ’ s authority to detain persons covered by the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) ( Public Law <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> ; <NUMBER> U . S . C . <NUMBER> note ) . This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary . The authority it describes was included in the <NUMBER> AUMF , as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then . Two critical limitations in section <NUMBER> confirm that it solely codifies established authorities . First , under section <NUMBER> ( d ) , the bill does not “ limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” Second , under section <NUMBER> ( e ) , the bill may not be construed to affect any “ existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens , lawful resident aliens of the United States , or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States . ” My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the <NUMBER> AUMF . Moreover , I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens . Indeed , I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation . My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law . Section <NUMBER> seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are “ captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force . ” This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States . The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa ’ ida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF , and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate . I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat . While section <NUMBER> is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty , I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations . I have concluded that section <NUMBER> provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security . Specifically , I have signed this bill on the understanding that section <NUMBER> provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it , and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement , including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States . As my Administration has made clear , the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa ’ ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical , guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strenhs and weaknesses of each system . Otherwise , investigations could be compromised , our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized , and intelligence could be lost . I will not tolerate that result , and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention . I will therefore interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past <NUMBER> years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation .

6544	food	Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place . In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised , completely free range raised without antibiotics . In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases . Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country . Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens . Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter . I'm not saying you are <NUMBER> % guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk , venison , wild boar , and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go . I hope that answers your question . I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it , I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me .	NOT

I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs . Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut , the first thing they do is trim back recon programs . When there is massive military spending during war time , the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets . An example of this is the SR - <NUMBER> getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA . It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back ( which NASA refused ) , so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes , some of which were being prepared for static displays . That stuff is fact , my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear . Satellites are great for strategic recon , but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions .	NOT

Back when I played WoW , I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did , the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages . With members of a guild , that was different ; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids , etc . For team FPS games , I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages ( unless I'm staring at the spawn screen ) . Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player , even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP , is beneficial to gameplay , in my opinion .	NOT

RASCZAK ( O . S . ) The end of another school year , and for me no doubt another failure ... Rico , pay attention The teacher JEAN RASCZAK , <NUMBER> , a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand , scowls at Johnny , bemused . JOHNNY Sorry , Mr . Rasczak . But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class , Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen . RASCZAK Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos , and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since ... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY , <NUMBER> , with his stump . LANNY It's a reward ... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service . Rasczak is crestfallen , makes a big show of patience . RASCZAK No . Something given has no value Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential ... Laughter . Johnny's cartoon , meanwhile , is taking shape : Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship . RASCZAK When you vote , you're exercising political authority . You're using force . And force , my friends , is violence , the supreme authority from which all other authority derives . CARL JENKINS , <NUMBER> , a superintelligent geek , jumps in . CARL Gee , we always thought you were the supreme authority , Mr . Rasczak . Laughter . Rasczak grins . RASCZAK In my classroom , you bet . Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it . DIZZY FLORES , <NUMBER> , athletic , pretty , no nonsense , chimes in . DIZZY My mother always says that violence never solves anything . RASCZAK Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that . You . Rasczak points at Carmen . CARMEN They probably wouldn't say anything . Hiroshima was destroyed . Johnny presses ´ "" SEND "" on his desk , and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen . RASCZAK Correct . Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . The contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . While Rasczak looks away , Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile , and Johnny's gone , checked out , flying round Venus . RASCZAK People who forget that always pay ... They pay with their lives and their freedom . Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face . So does Rasczak . He points at him with his stump , snaps Johnny to . RASCZAK You . Tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ? JOHNNY The difference lies in the field of civic virtue . A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . The civilian does not . RASCZAK The exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? JOHNNY Uh , I don't know . RASCZAK Of course you don't . I doubt if any of you here would recognize ' civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass . A bell rings . Rasczak shrugs , indifferent . RASCZAK Well , that's it . Have a nice life ."	NOT

After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself , I dropped out , and went home for the holidays . I was <NUMBER> at the time , and life was terrifying . All my friends were still in College and I had no direction . Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school , my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up . I flew back on Jan 5th of <NUMBER> and did some research . I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment . By Jan 7th ( and $ <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> poorer ) I was enrolled in a <NUMBER> week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries , techniques , and artisan breads . Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly , this type of education was ideal . Virtually no classroom time , about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen . There was no introduction course or busy work . We jumped RIGHT into it , from day one . Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life , and the most beneficial education I have received . Even though I don't have a degree , I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town . Work was easy but intense , long hours with lots of production . The bakery was American baked goods , cookies , cupcakes , brownies , cakes etc . I loved to be baking , but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job . After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town . I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft . Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged ( worked for free ) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing , young and upcoming pastry chef . That experience taught me a few things . Fine dining is a very fast paced , long houred ( this job was 16hrs a day , non-stop , on your feet . ZERO breaks , in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City ) occupation that requires total devotion . You lose your social life with a job like that , but gain experience and recognition . When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs , since it is what I love to do . When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me . You can make a career as a chocolatier , tempering chocolate into truffles and such . You can be a bread baker or cake decorator , an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection . There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set . If baking is your passion , I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later . - Many high schools / community centers offer cooking classes for teens . These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age . I wish I had known about this when I was your age . Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved . While your friends run track and play in the band , you should be out there baking up a storm . - It's a little early at <NUMBER> , but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts . There are schools like Johnson and Wales , real universities with actual degrees , that are <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking / cooking . There are schools that focus solely on cooking / baking like Culinary Institute of America . And then there are schools that are short term , full immersion courses like I did . In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street <NUMBER> . Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time , but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university . Many people go to college for <NUMBER> years and then pursue their path in pastry . In these hard times , I would say skip the degree , and get as much experience in now . Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday , and if it is , learn as much as you can now . Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program . Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day . Worst case they say no , and move on to the next bakery . Don't be afraid to work for free . Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age . Hope this helps , and I wish you luck !	NOT

I would really only specifically state the method to use when I taught two methods that could both be used to solve the problem .

Somewhat related , I remember giving my students a choice between exams with "" show your work "" problems and multiple choice questions . At first , they were very excited about multiple choice .

7227	IWantToLearn	"^ Excellent intro to philosophy . Also If you want to go chronologically , For Western Philosophy : look into the pre socratics then Aristotle and Plato Augustine Berkely , Locke , Hume Hobbes Heidegger Kant Hegel Nietsche - - read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus ' The Orestia , Sophocles ' Oedipus Cycle , and Euripides the Bacchae . Max Weber , Emile Durkheim Marx Freud / Jung The Existentialists like Sartre ( Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists , and Dadaists , a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot ) . From there you can go into branches by country or general era . The German , French , English , American , and Russian Philosophic traditions . Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss , Sybolists like Richard Gerz , Pragmatists like Richard Rorty . And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt , Theoretical Physists like Einstein , Psychodynamic ( kinda bullshitty ) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology , with thinkers like Bahktin . For Eastern Traditions : For Post Structuralism / Modernism / Post Modernism : Look into Foucault , Judith Butler , You should start with confucianism , Taoism , and Hindu thought . Look into the Vedas , the Bhagaveghita , and Bhudism . And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light , theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy . Look into Mystism , like Islamic Sufism , the Christian text "" The Cloud of Unknowing , "" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell , Walter Benjamin ( Who is awesome in everything , look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History ) , and Gershom Sholem ."

My game has the party as reincarnated high priests of Pelor getting sent out as a crack team of undead stompers . They're going up against one Vecna's top lieutenants , Osterneth , the Bronze Lich . I tossed out most of her back story and came up with my own , though keeping her personality traits . The world itself is one that I've run another campaign in about a year ago , except the current campaign is <NUMBER> years in the future after she's taken over and rules most of the world with undead . Suffice to say the party from the first campaign failed to stop her , lol . Unfortunately , two of the <NUMBER> players from that group ( not my Sunday group ) moved away and the game had to end . I was a little relieved because running <NUMBER> games simultaneously while playing in a 3rd is a wee bit taxing . I only got the thorn dice about a month ago and now I make sure to use them to maximum dramatic effect . Sometimes it's a treasure role , sometimes it's letting the dice decide how a chaotic NPC will respond , sometimes it's an environmental hazard or random encounter . They never know except that it means something interesting is about to happen .	NOT

Black Africans are the worst at this , and it shows everywhere they go . I think societies and their cultures developed in an organic , practical manner . Things are done a certain way for reasons that aren't readily apparent .

Which is to say that those laws still apply , but clearly most Christians don't actually follow them , and that's because they can just have Jesus absolve them of their breaking of God's laws . God says himself , in the Old Testament , that his laws ( covenant ) will be different in the future . There are numerous references in the New Testament to Jesus being and / or bringing that new covenant . He also repeatedly states that within this new covenant there are only two rules : Love God above any other , and love your neighbor as yourself Eeeehhhnnn . Sorry , that's a wrong answer , Jimmy .

Discussing whether or not this premise makes sense under the idea of an omnipotent God is irrelevant to the discussion of whether Christianity is based on morals while Islam is based on coercion and violence .

I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen . I see the schools failing to provide the education I received . In general everything since <NUMBER> has gotten progressively worse . Of course , in <NUMBER> I never even thought like this at all . I supported our president then .

I realized this was not the world I grew up in , and due to things beyond my control may never be . I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience . I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain . Then I stopped thinking about the past . I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own . I changed the way I lived . I lowered expenses . I learned to cook and bake . Then I learned to grow a few foods . I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible , like sewing , building , designing furniture . I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy . When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings , we reduced going out and starting staying in . We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead . We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least . When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity , we cut back , saved and got some solar power . When we couldn't afford the <NUMBER> dollar water bills , my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden .

I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive . I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad .

7881	Urbandead	As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since <NUMBER> ... no . Just no . You claim that we “ took over nearly the entire map . ” This isn't true in the slightest . We went from mall to mall , taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses , then going to the next without any stops in between . If you wanted a safe place to sleep , you could go , oh , I don't know , anywhere else on the map ! Seriously , if you just went <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> blocks away , we wouldn't have touched you . There's also that huge portion of the map that's green . When the Mall Tour was going , the only red suburbs were the Bonk , Dunell Hills , and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes ... and you guys . Also , considering that you've been around since <NUMBER> , I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate . If you want an example of a good defense , look at Bale Mall . We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at show up . This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies . You can see this on [ the stats page ] ( <URL> greatest proportion of level <NUMBER> players are military , and <NUMBER> % of standing players are survivors . Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies , where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes . You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them , because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead . That is not Urban Dead . Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually try to survive . This isn't a game so simple as going around killing ; it's about teamwork , communication , and strategy . That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique - - playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor . If you want to revive Urban Dead , you need something beyond balance changes . You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead . Short of attracting new players , the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game . Try playing a zombie , a PKer , a combat reviver , or a dual nature character . Playing on “ the other side ” will really help you see how the game works . It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants ; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either , but it's still fun for everyone . It's the same game for any character you play , but with different goals and incentives , and no matter what , it's fun . If you don't find it fun , then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you .

Instead of Muslim extremism Id be more worried about rampid consumerism , like how black Friday is becoming a thing . I can only speak for southern France though . I'm personally more afraid of Western Europe losing there wonderful worker rights and universal insurance from the unskilled workers coming in driving down wages which I haven't heard much of because most of them don't work anyways.But I feel that's more likely then thinking shariah law will be enforced .

It was obvious that she had lost a ton of weight and only looked decent with her clothes on but like a loose sack of shit with her clothes off . Pushing through through the awkwardness I decided to give it the ole ' college try . I started to go through with it and got down to business . I went to get a mouth full of nipple and sucked just a little . It's breast had next to no elasticity and buckled like a plastic bag full of water and went straight down my throat . I instantly started gagging and stopped immediately . She started asking what was wrong as I started gathering my shit and her concern turned to anger as I explained why I was leaving . I was depressed and disgusted for like three days later . Long hot showers and reflecting on my life decisions lasted for weeks until I met a tight little brown haired German chic that rivaled me at the gym .	EXP

8141	uncensorednews	"Well hello , yet again , / u / p220 [ <NUMBER> ] . If you feel overwhelmed , perhaps it's due to the reality that there are an overwhelming number of ways to argue against Islam . Not feeling overwhelmed at all would just love to keep the conversation on point instead of a big copy and paste of prepared polemics arguing your "" side "" , as opposed to an intellectual , substantive debate where both sides listen to each other and speak on a particular subject without worrying about "" what side "" should win . Thank you for your concern though . The best thing that would help me would be to keep the conversation on a single topic , otherwise , it's not as productive . Would it make sense if I pasted a bunch of pro-islam websites instead of doing the hard work of typing out my own responses on the topic ? Or attacked your character as opposed to speaking generally to the topic ? The number of Muslim friends to which I could introduce you is probably greater than the number of Muslim friends to which you could introduce me well then I guess we'll have to stick to the subject matter , like Quran and Hadeeth instead of "" I talk to muslims all the time and they're like totally misogynist ! "" anecdotes . Unless you want to talk about muslims today vis-a-vis Islam as opposed to Islam itself as enshrined in the historical record and the corpus of key religious texts . You mean bias like when someone replies repeatedly whilst coyly attempting to obscure the reality that in their so-called "" reply "" they have completely avoided addressing any of the points which were previously brought up ? You're right , that is rather transparent . No offense . I apologize . Which point did I miss ? You pasted a huge wall of text , and I assume it was not some kind of prepared argument and you really typed that all out , so I apologize for not going through it thoroughly . Let me correct this issue now in good faith , which point would you like me to address ? How is this a problem ? ( for the record , that was a rhetorical question ; as you're clearly incapable of addressing points , please don't reply as I won't read it-no offense . This reply is entirely for the entertainment of the casual bystander who happens down this tabbit hole of a comment thread ) . If someone has a pulse , and believes in something , they will pick a side which makes sense to them . I'll reiterate - picking sides isn't a problem , letting your side endanger your impartiality and neutrality that can become an issue . I . e . when your agenda trumps the facts For example , you are clearly very biased negatively towards Islam . Whereas I am not prosyletising , rather speaking to the facts ( if not , I would love to be corrected ) . It is only natural that those who are not neutral would copy the view of the extremist . It makes for a convenient way to malign the target . WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN BRO ? That was not very clear , my point was , if one "" side "" wants to malign the "" other "" , one great technique is to make a "" straw man "" out of the other side . <URL> Have you considered the possibility that to achieve anything worthwhile in life , one must pick a direction and cease to be neutral ? I believe I addressed this when I previously said : "" This is something we all do in varying degrees of course ; it is impossible and undesirable to avoid bias completely . However it is much another thing to be able to recognize one's own bias and not be controlled by it . That is where most people fail . "" One should actually choose a direction and not let the direction choose for them . "" The blind lead the blind . "" But not you , amirite ? No . Everyone makes mistakes . Some people cover it up , some people are honest about it . The latter is a key component of wisdom , in my view . If you don't make these kind of mistakes , you have no need to be defensive ."	EXP

We know releasing an object results in it falling towards Earth . That's the law of gravity . The theory is the mechanisms and maths behind why gravity exist . Einstein's Theory of Relativity is the one such theory for gravity .

However , we're not talking about weightlifting altering your waist size , we're talking about height . My argument , however , is not bullshit and I'm sorry if it offended you as such . I'm not basing it on bullshit either . I'm basing it on two things - - my careers . First of which was fashion modeling . A career , as I've said before elsewhere , literally built on the backs of tall women in sample sizes . And my current career , which I am working on a PhD in , is the study of bioarchaeology / osteology . Human skeletal remains . I know bones . Frame size does not vary all that much within one sex . Bodybuilding can build thicker bones , yes , but it's that huge muscle growth that's gripping the bone that's going to make a difference in your size . Your example has little to do with height . Your height does not change the density of your bones . This woman has a wide pelvic cage . Her iliums likely flare out much more than average . She is unusual . That can happen on a slender short woman , it is independent of height . My reasoning stands . The average woman , built with a normal frame , who doesn't lift heavy , tall or short , is getting fat at a US size <NUMBER> . Are there outliers ? Yes , there's always outliers . And if you're a <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> "" + woman , your entire body existence is an outlier . People my height are unusual enough . By that height , you're the size of a large male , and all clothing size bets are off for a woman . Frame width definitely adjusts at that large . But again , we're talking serious outliers here . When most people say tall women , they're usually talking about <NUMBER> ' <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> ' . Edit : I just wanted to add for .. I don't know , interesting informational purposes . It's not that we can't and don't measure frame size . That's part of the process of every skeletal analysis I do . And anyone ( human sized ) can measure their wrists and get an idea of their basic frame type . But we're still taking minute differences . Just because you and the person next to you measure small and large frame sizes respectively doesn't directly mean you're going to be wearing hugely different clothing sizes . Bone thickness can tell us a lot of things , depending on how thick it is and where it's thick , about how a person lived . It's very useful in archaeological studies , generally for determining the most common activities someone did , and what sort of health issues may have plagued them ."	EXP

8328	femmit	I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right ( like Zombieland ) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks .

Luckily , the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks ( at least conventional ones like Sex in the City ; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it , The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering <URL> Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies , the heroine who saves the world ( sadly , it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick ) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females ; and when they do , it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device ( I'm looking at you , White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake ) . I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games ? I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence , but then she hooks up with a boy . Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game ? Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters ' relationship ? I think that we are slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains , but it's going to take time for Hollywood , that most vapid of cities , to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go .

I have had one best friend my whole life , and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner . Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon . I have problems letting people in , but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place . I was married , which is how i ended up in california and nebraska , and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina . I don't plan on staying here no . I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area , though i'm not sure . I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people . Either way , i don't have anything keeping me here . Thank the gods for Reddit . Where's your mom from ? While i agree that some things are ... i dunno what the word is ... more abundant here , i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer .

TSH stands for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone , and it's what's released from your pituitary to tell your thyroid to release thyroid hormone . If you have an underactive thyroid , your TSH actually goes up , not down , because your pituitary sees that there isn't much thyroid hormone in your blood and tries to drive your thyroid even harder by ramping up TSH . A low-normal TSH actually indicates a robustly active thyroid gland . She's got extra thyroid hormone in her blood , which is why her TSH is low-normal , and thyroid hormone ramps up metabolism .

A Skinner box is a piece of equipment which allows us to control the variables and contingencies that act upon organism in the world . In other words , a Skinner box is a representation of the real world . There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box , they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn . To say that "" Game X is a Skinner box "" is to say "" The gamer learns how to play the game "" . To put it more simply : everything is a Skinner box in this sense , as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning . The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of "" Game X is a Skinner box "" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are "" tricking "" you into playing without "" real "" enjoyment . This makes no sense . There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up "" addictive "" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule . And again , practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered . tl ;d r : Yes , games are like Skinner boxes .

8656	socialism	well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist . Lets take Cuba first . It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s . Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America . There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US ' terrorist war and blockade of the island . In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years , illiteracy has been wiped out , there are <NUMBER> % more people voting in elections than before , malnourishment has been banished forever etc . There's a common idea that what was called ' socialism ' in Eastern Europe failed . Well , it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument . I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world . Since <NUMBER> the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again . Sure , GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything , such as the right to not die or the right to go to school . At the heart of your question is what constitutes being ' poor ' . I really don't think there are any poor countries left - maybe <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> years ago there were . Let me explain ; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of ' poor places ' . But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny . Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British . Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities , gold dripping from wall to wall . Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world . And yet it may have more natural resources than any other . It is teeming with minerals and metals . Where's the money going ? Into Dutch oil companies , Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies . In fact , the countries which ' should ' be poorest , those with the least amount of resources , are the richest ( western europe ) . There are no poor countries , only poor people . What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out , these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s . There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now , but , because of capitalism , the majority of the world still lives in poverty . So , in answer , the people would be much better off under socialism .	NOT

8737	atheism	Yes , and that's a shame , and a fixable problem . Get better standards , enforce them better , etc etc etc . These kinds of things are impossible to do in homeschooling because parents are not teachers . How many times do I have to say this ? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS ? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes . You cannot police it . You cannot qualify or disqualify parents . It . Cannot . Be . Done . This is what schools do . This is why teachers exist . Professionals are not amateurs . ALL OF THEM ? The government has , at least by extension , power over the following : The training and certification that teachers go through . Thereby , the recommended teaching methods . The employment of teachers , therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability . A broad control over what gets taught , in the form of a curriculum . A teacher's conduct , in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children , and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors , many other children , and to some degree their parents . Probably more , my head hurts . Homes are not schools . The statements do not contradict eachother , which is quite clear if you read it properly . What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a ' school ' that did not exist other than monthly ( or less frequently ) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability , where the people involved knew that everything , including the tests , submitted to the government were an absolute , blatant lie . I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children . There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school . I'm aware what ' teaching to the test ' is . What is your problem with it , exactly ? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests , then ? If so , put them on the test . It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids , by definition . The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible . Even if that were not the case , I would oppose it on grounds of isolation . A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely , making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like . You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient . In what ways ? What types of things would you like ensured ? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are . If teachers are failing at their jobs , fire them . If teachers in general are failing at their jobs , reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs . If there aren't enough teachers , offer them more money . None of these are things we can do with parents . I did have that thought about private schools as well , and not ' just as ' , but they certainly are vulnerable to it . I think , in that case , there's not much that can be done about it . They are privately owned for-profit businesses , and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own .	NOT

You got Mao at the other side and Hitler at the other end . The goal both of the left and right movement is to maintain a political balance that serves the people . And if countries will not place restrictions on hate speech , how do you want it to pan out ? For these hateful idealogies to thrive and succeed ? Is that we want , for second wave of Nazi and communist ideals to succeed and infect the succeeding generations ? They are not just ideals . They are hate groups who promote hatred and hostility towards other designated sector of the society . Sure , neo nazis still exist , but with continued resistance from moderates and anti fascists , they are limited and driven underground . I don't know what liberty was taken last week that you're talking about , obviously the government let the white supremacists to hold their rally , and people faced them .

He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head . To them this was amazing , but I'm sure you guys agree , Algebra <NUMBER> is trivial .

None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier ( in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions ) . There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you ( e . g . plants modified to be resistant to bacteria ) . I am very aware of these factors and , yes , it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat , but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process . I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants , but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole . Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does . Without these sources of food many people would starve . Edit : And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you , <NUMBER> % against them . It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another ( poorer ) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free . The people laughed . They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death . They would do anything to have the level of production we have . They don't see our factory farms as cruel , they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology . We have the audacity to take that for granted ."	NOT

You act like the US should be greatful they have a country like Israel they're forced to give expensive military equipment to for free , which Israel then sells to the Chinese and continues to build illegal settlements despite promising the US not to . you pay them huge money for oil they pump out of their ground for free Are you delusional ? Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free , the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things . Even if it was free it's irrelevant , Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something , be it oil or cocaine or whatever , and with that money its buying military equipment from the US . It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours , at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales ( or at least breaking even ) , as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money . As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money . Man the Israel propaganda machine has done a real number on you . But yeah israel is all mean to people that are shooting rockets at their cities day in day out and who send suicidebombers to blow up their kids , how uncivilized to not simply be happy about that right ? And they killed jesus right ? but you are just being reasonable right ? right ... We're not talking about any of that , we're talking about how the US is Israels bitch :) Besides , Israels terrorist activities , numerous crimes against humanity , and general constant dickishness does not go away because of what someone else did . I'll let you have the last word , I'm not going to reply anymore to someone so stupid who thinks that pumping oil out of the ground is free or that Saudi Arabia paying for US aircraft is the same thing as the US giving Israel aircraft for free . If you ever run a business where you sell stuff please do let me know , I'll visit you and ask you give me money so that I can buy something you're selling , it makes good business sense right ? :D	NOT

Ron Paul - Bill of rights <URL> If anything , the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states . If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility , we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases — not only when it serves our interests . The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law , not federal law . Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property , but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level . The people of New London , Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place . Ron Paul lying about the Constitution The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance . Throughout our nation's history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility . Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government . This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state . Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage . Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war . "" The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers . On the contrary , our Founders ' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs . Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion . "" Ron Paul on sexual harassment "" Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity , "" Paul wrote . "" Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts ? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended , but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem ? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable . "" Ron Paul - We the people act The We the People Act forbids federal courts , including the Supreme Court , from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "" privacy , "" including cases involving sexual practices , sexual orientation or reproduction . The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage . In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers , the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President , according to rules established by the Congress ."

9644	sjwhate	"I'll take a crack at this one since I have some experience here : Or maybe why we all have to play along with the delusions of "" trans "" people , while the reality of White genocide is a perfectly acceptable target for ridicule ? I'm going to answer "" Why should we all play along with trans people ? "" Being transgender is a medical condition which can be diagnosed based on a set of symptoms . Over the years , we've tried many different things to alleviate those symptoms ; including electroshock therapy , conversion therapy ( positive reinforcement of birth gender ) , supplementing testosterone for transgender women ( male to female people ) , and plain ol ' classic denial . After literally decades , the medical community decided "" What if we try letting them be who they say they are ? "" and noted that , for those who are able to be treated normally as their identified gender ( so , for a male to female transgender person , this would mean treating them as a woman ) their quality of life improved - - not cured necessarily , but improved . Flash forward a few years and we have the technology to increase the likelihood that these people are treated normally by society ( by things like hormone replacement therapy and surgery ) and quality of life of transgender people can still be seen to improve . Again , not perfectly , but there's marked improvement . This is all fine and dandy for those transgender people who do fit in , but what of those that do not ? Unfortunately , there's not a magic pill which can make any person "" fit "" into what society says a man or a woman should look like , and for those people , relief from their symptoms is hard to come by . So , we ask that all of us have compassion for these people , imagine ourselves in their shoes , and treat them with the decency and respect that we would treat anyone else . - note : fine and dandy doesn't mean there are no problems left . A transgender person's own body tends to deeply distress them , and that isn't something we can really cure - - we can do a lot , but things like the suicide rate and general outlook on life won't reach normal levels until our technology increases even further . I'm stating this before someone links that one swedish study everyone loves to cite to show surgery doesn't work . :) Hope my input was interesting , I think I've rambled long enough ."	IMP

Basically , I've just got run of the mill depression , panic disorder , as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , which causes me extreme chronic pain , I have seen palliative care physicians , neurologists , physiatrists ( not the same as a psychiatrist ) , and pain management physicians ( anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine ) , neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , and of course a few internists , all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis . The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part ( though , I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode , I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like ) . Basically , the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things , things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain , like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games , walking up stairs , going to the store , but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance . It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation ( though at times my motivation is low ) , but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent . For example , my last year of high school ( I graduated in <NUMBER> ) I missed at least two days every week , I still graduated in the top <NUMBER> % of my class , and graduated with honors , but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to ( Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations , tendon / ligament injuries , etc ) , the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain ( I have a syrinx in my spinal cord , you'd understand what it is if you look it up , if you don't already , it is usually caused by a chiari malformation , which I don't really have ) . The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life . But , I have big dreams , I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist , those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me , and I love studying them . But , due in part to my depression , and pain , I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities . You see , when I was in 1st grade , I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability ( the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours , I had to redo this testing every couple of years , all of the testing took <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there ) . During school , I was in a special ed class to help with my math ( but in a regular math class , the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it , and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed , I'm sure you understand the special education system ) . However , I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself , nor have I learned much about it , I don't even know the name of the disorder . I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability , I mean , I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities , but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all , if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability ( as in , what IS my disability , I can understand medical and psychological information with ease , I've considered going into medicine even ) . The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology , psychology , or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus , as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required , including calculus . Therefore , I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician , medical doctor , or academic , and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression . TL ;D R - Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses . NOTE : I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions , but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally , and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever . I am not asking for medical or psychological advice , as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally , it'd be a legal liability on your part . If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message , or have more specific questions to ask me , please feel free to send them in a private message . I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post . Regards , - Nick W .	NOT

Anyone who had any in depth knowledge of the insurance industry knew how much of a failure Obamacare was going to be . When insurance providers can't turn down people who are prone to various illnesses due to living a horrible lifestyle , insurance premiums are going to skyrocket for people who actually take care of themselves . Also , the general premise of not being allowed to turn down people with preexisting conditions ( like morbid obesity ) is like allowing someone to total their car and apply for insurance right after .

10258	leagueoflegends	I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done , but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic . There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG , and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy . Here are my notes on the cards ; everything is within the context of modern design . Banshee ’ s Veil : The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to . While it is technically possible for the effect to occur ( when you target your own creatures with spells ) it makes no sense within the context of banshee ’ s veil . The effect you are looking for is : “ Whenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn , counter that spell or ability . ” I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability , when adjusted for creature power inflation , suggests it is valued below hexproof . The first ability is almost irrelevant . Overall , this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon ( or even if it were a common at that ) . I would price it at around <NUMBER> to cast <NUMBER> to equip . That is a rough number though as it ’ s a harder keyword to price . Brand : With the restrictive cost of 1RRR , it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red . Even the reflecting pool / vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red . From a competitive standpoint , brand is an <NUMBER> mana , <NUMBER> turn investment for a conditional two for one ( his first ability is costed at <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> of a black lotus more than what it should be ) . At <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> , he is not aggressively price and he dies to – everything - . You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either , as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual , yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun . Cloth Armor : Costs way too much . <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip might even be too weak given the effect . I might consider <NUMBER> cast <NUMBER> equip with + <NUMBER> / + <NUMBER> , but that might be too strong for a common in limited ( probably not though ) . Hard to determine a limited metagame though . Corki : Too complicated for an uncommon . Too weak for constructed , but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited . The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects . Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures . The last sentence is also useless . Long Sword : Costs way too much . It should cost more than cloth armor , but otherwise the same criticisms stand . Mordekaiser : Probably the most appropriate of the cards , however death during next upkeep limits its use . Would change to something along the lines of “ sacrifice it at the end of your next turn ” so it gets one attack in at least . Adjust to <NUMBER> / <NUMBER> . Casual only , no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed , though similar creatures are not without precedence ( see ink-eyes ) . Riven : <NUMBER> multicolored mana and <NUMBER> turns for a conditional shock is not good . Actually , I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself . Second ability should cost <NUMBER> black lotus less than it does . Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability . Also its not WW2 , 2WW only . Sight Ward : Wouldn ’ t even be good if it cost <NUMBER> . Maybe cantrip it when it dies ? Vision Ward : Even worse than sight ward . Cantrip ’ ing it would still make it worse than a cantrip ’ d sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward . Warwick : Suffers from the exact same problems as corki , too complicated for an uncommon , will never find a place in constructed , but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity .	NOT

10314	fatpeoplehate	"I work with kids , and some of the problems I see as a teacher's aide ( USA state funded before and after school care ) are that kids aren't getting educated in how much they should eat , and of what things . Hell when I was in school it it wasn't even taught how much you should eat of what , yes the food pyramid was gone over , but nothing about Cals in Cals out what is an actual healthy meal . Granted I am in my <NUMBER> ' s so fat when I was in school was the kid who was like <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> pounds over weight not <NUMBER> . I don't think we'll see programs like this in the US , not because of feelings , well in some communities it could be because of feelings . I'm looking at you home town ... ( some place in Nor Cal ) But also because of the way schools are funded in the USA , if you look at what programs tend to get cut first during a budget crisis , it's always arts , fitness , and recess . Instead of having a few less admin or secretaries ... But if you look at how much time kids actually get outside and get running at the elementary school level it's really sad , it ends up being less then 25mins total for a <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> hour day . The rest of the time they are behind their desks , and forced to focus , not only does this create problems in terms of them actually learning and being able to focus , it also leads to a lot of the childhood weight problems we are seeing . Some studies and teachers also point to this as a rise in the amount of ADD they are seeing . Now while I believe that ADD is real , as someone who works with kids , I can also see how over diagnosed it is . Because of the lack of physical activity the kids get now , also the kind of activity they can get . A lot of schools have banned games like kick ball , or tag , because kids could fall and get hurt . So they end up being expected to even play quietly when out side . Now if you live in a high income area , you don't have much to worry about , because in the US schools are funded by property tax . So a kid in the school district for the upper Haight probably isn't going to have to worry about PE or Sports being cut , in the way that kid in the district covered by the Tenderloin is . A lot of things are going into Childhood obesity and it's something that makes me fucking sad , at the k - <NUMBER> level because at that age range you don't have much control over your life and what you eat , and if you aren't getting the education on how to fuel your body and take care of it , then how are you going to know later on ? I have no sympathy for adult fatties , because they can talk to their doctors , they can use the google and things like MFP , and know how to learn things . I really think it comes down to schools giving kids enough activities and education on their bodies to end this problem , but it's not just a matter of hurting peoples feelings it's a matter of having the money to provide that education . Most teachers end up spending about <NUMBER> dollars a year of their own money to keep their class rooms going . The way we teach kids about food needs to change , and there also needs to be a change in the attitude held by parents where they just scream "" THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY DARLING I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU . "" That so many parents have today . Parents can decide not to vaccinate , parents can say no I don't want you to hold my baby back a grade even if they can't read , parents can decide if they want there kid to be fat ... this is the attitude that needs to change ."

Either he's not powerful enough to prevent the suffering of innocent human beings , or he just doesn't care . Even if you don't believe in God yourself , we live in a society where , at least in America , belief in the Christian God is considered to be the default .

You should drop the idea that there is anything but brands and atomized identities in America . Addidas holds more people together than old values like imperial prestige or small-government agrarian libertarianism - if you disagree with this , youre just slow , or havent understood the events of the post-ww <NUMBER> social changes . Token desperate identification with these older values means exactly that they no longer exist or else theyd need no advocacy .

Redpills want to go back , and blue to go forwards , each for their own sake as such with the inanity that comes with desiring something for its own sake . You are right that nations are poor for lack of interest from the market , but increasing globalization and cheapening labor have pushed the market into places it has never been before . The Middle East has seen billionaires born overnight from oil and it has destroyed their traditionalism - just look at Mecca today and the reactionary ISIS as a hyperaccelerated version of what has played out across the West .

11253	atheism	"Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions / gods / ultimate rule maker-appraiser . In my experience processed faith in a deity ( ies ) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma . Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the ' be good to each other ' kind ( though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity ) . This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the "" holy "" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward / punish you for your acts in life and beyond . The promise / threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain ( dopamine release ) which helps sustain the work / effort for a future payoff ( or avoid a punishment ) . Faith , then , can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training ; you could do it yourself on your own , but a physical trainer ( with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline ) is likely to be more effective . You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith ( or religious dogma ) , but the "" learning "" of Faith / dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and , where applicable , overcome . "" Faith "" then can have a positive effect on the person , their family , friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect . Unfortunately , since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow ( e . g . , gain more power , wealth , numbers - whatever counts as their ' currency ' ) , the need to subvert others to their "" Faith "" is a prime theme of religion . It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain / grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code . If a person / group has "" Faith "" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought , they are not necessarily idiots , just unlearned . Think of "" Faith "" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge . Where I have issues with people of "" Faith "" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith . Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey , I feel like an attempt at rape ( mental ) is being made . I do , and will continue to , respect those that have Faith , that believe and practice a good , consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats : <NUMBER> . Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma . Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits . <NUMBER> . Continue seeking education about , well , everything . Continue to evolve as a person , with family and with local and global society . <NUMBER> . Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your "" Faith "" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself . I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face ."	NOT

It's safe to assume from there . White people have the same capacity to suffer as any other person . Hey that's a nice sentiment but usually when white people address they're concerns they're browbeaten into submissive silence , "" OH yes , you must have it sooo hard as a white person . "" Sound familiar ? I see it on reddit everywhere . Also , for the last few years we've had people with the audacity to say that , "" One cannot be racist to white people "" because they've conveniently defined what racism is .

Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us . We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable . The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start . So if this is true and she's not attracted to you , then why would she hang out with you , talk to you about her boy , her life , or her issues ? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human , and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives . Really . "" But why don't other girls do this with me ?

11555	OperationPullRyan	My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section <NUMBER> ( c ) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law . And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short , including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> needlessly interfere with the executive branch ’ s processes for reviewing the status of detainees . Going forward , consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report , my Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section . Sections <NUMBER> - <NUMBER> continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch . Section <NUMBER> renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year <NUMBER> to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose . I continue to oppose this provision , which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests . For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court . Those prosecutions are a legitimate , effective , and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation . Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security . Moreover , this intrusion would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . Section <NUMBER> modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch ’ s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country . This hinders the executive ’ s ability to carry out its military , national security , and foreign relations activities and like section <NUMBER> , would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers . In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict . Section <NUMBER> requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals . I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the <NUMBER> Authorization for Use of Military Force , the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section <NUMBER> before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment . Notwithstanding that limitation , this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference . Moreover , section <NUMBER> could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security . My Administration will interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , limits delays in the investigative process , ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited , and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice . Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers . Section <NUMBER> requires the President to submit a report to the Congress <NUMBER> days prior to sharing any U . S . classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia . Section <NUMBER> further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided . While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U . S . efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense , my Administration will also interpret and implement section <NUMBER> in a manner that does not interfere with the President ’ s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications . Other sections pose similar problems . Sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets ; and sections <NUMBER> , <NUMBER> , and <NUMBER> would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments . Like section <NUMBER> , should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities , I will treat the provisions as non-binding . My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation , but certain provisions remain concerning . My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief , will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future , and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office .

11618	uncensorednews	And I'm not even sure how you can say Democrats took Republican ideals and their version of conservatism I didn't . What are you referring to ? The borders and immigration policy ? You sound like a Democratic these days - - government intervention to fix things and keep them fair ? LOL . I think your brain is on the fritz with this . There is such a thing as too much intervention and I think your looking at it from a one or the other and no middle ground in terms of intervention . No to unnecessary regulations , yes to protecting American businesses especially small businesses . For example , the vaping industry ( the nicotine kind not the marijuana kind ) which is a fledgling industry being lumped with the tobacco corporations . One business , Provari and I think they were the only one that took the risk to make hardware in the USA , had to close due to FDA regulations and associated costs . They had to compete with chinese made vaping hardware which sold at more than competitive price . Only big tobacco which has their own vaping cigarette product lines was able to front the money . The GOP is so waist-deep in free market ideology that any regulation is overreach , from the EPA to consumers ' relations to more . Not sure if you've been paying close attention to the GOP over the past <NUMBER> years ... I honestly don't think you do . And with all your talk of capitalism , let foreign goods come in . It will make domestic markets react and make the proper adjustments accordingly . Free trade and all that good stuff . Which is perfectly fine when others play by the same rules , but how the hell can you compete when your intellectual property is stolen , made for cheaper and maybe not the same quality , and start flooding the market complete with a similar logo / name on it ? Product that you spent money researching and having to deal with regulations that constrict small businesses . Sometimes they don't even meet the same standards American businesses must adhere to for their product resulting in faulty knock offs . Large corporations aren't that vulnerable but an owners small business is . Not to mention <NUMBER> % of the other stuff I mentioned , like Social Security , labor laws , unions , and infrastructure that past Republican leaders have pushed which are abhorrent to a very solid chunk of the Republican party now . Some things are just good bipartisan things to have and then sometimes a good thing gets abused and no longer works . Social Security looked good in order to take care of senior citizens , but there has been some doubt in the past whether it is sustainable . Not to mention that whole large scale screw up at Experian that resulted in SSN's being stolen and now people are wondering if it should be replaced . Not sure which labor laws your referring to . Unions have been disliked and liked from both political parties , depends on the union . Republicans won't like an infrastructure plan that results in the government being the main employer , it's reminiscent of socialism and communism . The entire original argument was about political parties switching . It hasn't . Consistent ? We got President Trump , a former democrat , in the White House as a Republican .	EXP

My Administration will interpret section <NUMBER> in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution , the laws of war , and all other applicable law .

For a dog , which is even less compatible with such a disgusting diet than a human is . To counteract the beetus-basket , there was only a small plate of sodden old dog biscuits on the floor beside it ... that the dog ( somewhat understandably ) never touched . The bulldog was so obscenely fat that it couldn't walk much further than the garden path . It had NEVER been walked in its entire life ( and it wasn't exactly a puppy either ) . Furthermore , it had a host of medical problems that the show's veterinarian was shocked to even see in a dog . And the owners ( both drooping , retch-worthy lardsacks themselves ) had the gall to explain that they DIDN'T KNOW WHY . When the presenter challenged them about the dog's diet ( i . e . , the mound of sugary slag in the basket , which they were responsible for ) , they then went on to proclaim that THEY COULDN'T STOP THE DOG FROM EATING BAD FOOD .

Is she arguing merely because she thinks if there's two people in a talk they have to pick different sides ? I really think this comes down to "" I am not going to agree with you , nerrr "" .
