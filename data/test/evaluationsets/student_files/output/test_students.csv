Don't waste your time taking AP Envi Sci, stay with AP Lang.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

37	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)"	0.0

93	"&gt; Could you elaborate on this point?

There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.

&gt; I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me.

You could be right. I am not *such* a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line.

But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

Otherwise, take the +Atk -Spd one, with Fury your Ryoma will hit 60atk with the Atk seal and still have a very respectable 38 Spd."	0.0
112	Yes, but I shouldn't worry about it. It'll only be a problem if you have a history of bad credit. NZ credit checks aren't really like the States. - for the most part they just want to see if you have a history of missing payments more than anything.	0.0

120	"Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults.

Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult.

Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. 

If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above).

-----------

With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. 

Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen.

If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting 1 shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey.

It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots."	0.0

122	"I took issue with ME3's loot system too, TBH. It felt massively unrewarding in the final DLC when it became apparent you had to run 10~ games for one rank of a random UR. The only reasons it wasn't as widely hated as ME:A's, I think, were there were many excellent guns in all rarities (so the grind to max everything but UR was extremely rewarding), and the game was just a blast to play. You could play with purely the objective of trying new builds or just popping some heads or playing some space wizards and it was all gravy. This game currently lacks both of those things.

But yeah, never liked this loot system ever. It'd make oh so much more sense if the entire game/mode were free to acquire."	0.0

Dogbert: Fine.  And how are you?

But yes, we should definitely get deranked/losses every time the Ubisoft game/servers fail which is completely not at your fault. That's the logic of Reddit right? According to these down votes I assume that's what the people wants.

Random activities like theses were natural to Beacon, but he didn't really understand the use of this one. As he contemplated, he wasn't really paying attention to where he was going, which resulted in a collision with his bed.*	Not
54	czj76t9	czj7f77	WeAreTheMusicMakers	Most interfaces on windows work without drivers also.  I haven't installed any interface or other audio device driver in over 5 years.	You can just plug in the interface and use it, but don't you need to install the manufacturer's ASIO driver or ASIO4ALL? Otherwise you'll be using the  normal Windows audio stack, which has a lot more latency. CoreAudio also has an aggregate audio device feature, which could be useful to some people. The only way to do this on Windows is ASIO4ALL.	Not

Then he´s very nice for some specific teams: glass-cannon for fast farming due to LinkBoost4, and he´s one of the only 4 blood-boosters currently ingame. Of those 4, only he and Knight Yuri reduce HP to 30%, thus enabling some Desperation passives for certain units/gear (you do lose passives for 50% HP and above, like GE Edna has, but those are easy to use anyway and pack lesser multipliers too).  Also, back in the era pre-Phoenix&amp;Marta of almost no-bash finishers available, he could equip one for those that picked his SA last year (even tho his dmg is low, he could get the job done in the Tower of Trials).

64		dgyyq1q	BabyBumps		Yup. Puked two times, at 6 centimeters and then at like 8? The second time was while I was getting the epidural. I had horrific heartburn all through pregnancy, and even during labor. So I puked up the Tums I got.   I have HATED throwing up since I got my gallbladder out, but it really wasn't so bad. I felt worse about breathing puke breath in the nurse's face than I did about vomiting.   They say there are three things you should believe someone when they say: they are going to die, they are having this baby now, and that they are going to vomit. I got two in one go :)	Not

Albeit they can be sued for fraud, if they sell it under a different name and you have proof that you wrote it.

Adams, Alien and sedition acts, feud with Jefferson   1. Jefferson, writer of the declaration of independence    1. Madison, wrote the constitution     1. Monroe, the last of the founding father presidents    1. Adams part 2, his son.  Swore his oath on a constitutional law book instead of a bible.    1. Jackson, trail of tears, beating people with his cane, etc.   1. Van Buren, The Petticoat affair 1.

Polk (nobody remembers) 1. Taylor (nobody remembers, but he died in office) 1. Fillmore (nobody remembers) 1. Pierce (nobody remembers)  1. Then there's Buchanan, who was almost certainly gay   1. Then we're into the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln   1. Andrew Johnson was his VP and took over when he got assassinated, and was impeached but not removed from office   1. Grant, the civil war general, famous for a horribly corrupt administration 1. Then we've got Hayes, who nobody remembers   1. Then Garfield, notable for being ~~the first one~~ assassinated 1. His VP, Chester Arthur   1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers 1. Benjamin Harrison, who nobody remembers 1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers 1. McKinley, the second assassinated president   1. Teddy Fucking Roosevelt, trust buster, national parks founder, all around man's man   1. Taft, mostly famous for being fat and becoming a supreme court justice after being president   1. Woodrow Wilson, the last president to keep his campaign promises (at least his first term).  President during WWI, had a stroke, and his wife kind of took over.   1. Harding, the undisputed worst president, until \*ahem\* recently   1. Silent Cal, his vice president who took over when he died   1. Hoover, mostly famous for not getting us out of the depression.   1.

Sent in troops to desegregate schools 1. Kennedy, who slept with Marilyn Monroe and was assassinated   1. Johnson his VP, who promptly reversed course on Vietnam   1. Nixon who likely won because Bobby Kennedy was assassinated prior to the election, and of course he resigned in disgrace 1. Ford, who was never elected -- was appointed when Nixon's VP (Agnew) was forced out.   1. Carter, the peanut farmer, double digit inflation and got the Iran hostages released   1. Reagan, who took credit for getting the hostages released and played dumb when he got caught doing illegal shit.  He also liked jellybeans   1. Bush, who famously said no new taxes and then made new taxes   1. Clinton, who banged an intern and got impeached for lying about it, and set up the conditions for a future economic meltdown   1. Bush Jr, who created enormous deficits then blamed democrats for deficit spending, also 9/11 and mission accomplished and almost choking to death on a pretzel. 1.

One other thing to worry about with a TWOV is convincing the cruise line to let you board.  Airlines have deferred keeping track of all the visa rules to [Timatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timatic).  However cruise lines in the past have generally required you to have a visa for all the countries at which your cruise will visit.  This has caused some friction between passengers who don't want to pay for a Chinese visa when a transit should work and the cruise lines who want to keep it simple and require passengers to have a visa.  So you should check with the cruise line to make sure they can board without a visa.  Both at boarding in Osaka and at immigration in Shanghai they will need to show proof of booked tickets onward to a third country within 144 hours.	Not

179	My ex	0.0
180	"The Javik DLC from Mass Effect 3 is a good example of why management and publishing is a problem. They kept needing to extend and got pushback. Javik was supposed to be a bigger part of the story, but they had to cut it to work on other things. They kept a bit of it on disc because they wanted to finish it after the game was ""finished"" (already rated etc). After that, they finished From Ashes and it was ready by Day 1. So it looked like Bioware decided to cut a chunk of the story out for a few bucks when it actually wasn't the case at the end of the day. 

I do feel that Andromeda was mismanaged by both dev and publisher though. It's so obviously a rush job in the areas that were hard. Like branching story and those little details. They worked on combat and open worlds instead. 

So they spent 40 million on it, which is a bit too low honestly. ME3 was 40 million. Andromeda was a whole new engine AND a revamp of everything gameplay related. "	0.0

202	"I have oily skin with acne scars and redness, and some lingering adult acne. I also have minor discoloration from psoriasis around my eyebrows. I have had good results using Clinique's beyond perfecting foundation--it's pretty full coverage on me (without looking cakey) and has never irritated my skin. 

For a low-maintenance, everyday work look where I want sheerer coverage, I LOVE Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC cream. This has a very natural finish but still enough coverage to tackle covering blemishes--and never any skin irritation. I'm on my second tube of this now, I get it at CVS and they always offer promotions for PF products. I think it's a great value product for the price point! 

I've also found Too Faced's Primed and Poreless primer to be a great daily primer for smoothing out the look of textured skin for acne scars, and this also hasn't clogged my pores.

No!  I've been doing my own laundry for years.  I just don't know my way around the washing machines in this country!

Update: The AG271QG is a great panel. You can immediately tell it's an IPS, and loaded up with Overwatch, I didn't notice any dropped frames or screen tearing. Secondly, I went to lightbleedtest.com, and found no excessive light bleed anywhere. However, the top right corner of the screen does glow more than the rest of the panel. Thus to say, it's inconsistent, but the bleed isn't horrendous. Lastly, it's designed really well. All the stand pieces are metal. I feel confident it can survive a desk bump. It also has a hook behind the monitor as a headphone holder, and there's a hole in the middle of the stand for cable management. The title is 27"" 1440p 144hz IPS G-Sync, and it sells for $650.

298	What I find curious is that the OP created this account 25 days ago, with the vast majority of its activity happening on this post.

325	I study the Middle East as a major. For religiously motivated terrorists (which the cult basically is) there are several things to remember. They're highly ideologically motivated, but they're generally actually quite UNknowledgable about their own religion and religion in general. They've been taught a cherry-picked version of religion, so while they might spout off the basics easily, any deep discussion of theological principles will leave them baffled in short order, and they might be misinformed about basic details of how religion even functions.   think about the what the cult would want to keep hidden, or lie about. he might know how a cell is organized, but his knowledge of how to contact a cell might have been all lies. he might not know who heads the cult, or if he does, only knows them as a shadowy figure giving out kill orders. if the cult higher ups say, intend to offer up the footsoldiers to tiamat as a snack, he might not know that, because the cult would want to leave out details that might break the narrative 	0.0

349	"I worked at a call center for all of three days.  That was literally the longest that I could last, and I was up with guilt-ridden nightmares for both of the nights in between. The thing is, I wasn't working a sales gig (at least not in the traditional sense): I was a ""talent scout"" for an incredibly shady organization that sought to trick parents into purchasing ""acting and modeling lessons"" for their kids.  There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.  That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training.

365	"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out.  **EDIT** Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation:   * Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA. * ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info!) * Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol. * While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and *maybe* it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents. * All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead.   So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE  WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED!"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before."	1.0

And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language.  But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say.  

I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn.  Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness.  I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about.  Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style.  

But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream.  

I've never met someone that could.  And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to.  It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about.  I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt.

400	"I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. 4 years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying 4 yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want.

 Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. 

It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this. "	0.0

414	"I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes:
 I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well.  It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. 
I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes.
And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than 4 star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. 

Current top series:

* **Way of Kings/Words of Radiance**: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)
* **Song of Ice and Fire:** Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change. 
* **LOTR** Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling,  it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is *fantasy* with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.
* **Riyria Revelations**: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.
* **Dresden Files** I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role. 
* **Hard Magic Series**: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.
* **Ready Player One**:Just a fun read. The 80's were fun.
* **Enders Game**: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.
* **Wheel of Time series**: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.
* **Hitchhikers Guide series**: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.
* **Asimov's Foundation Series** More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.
* **Dragon Riders of Pern**:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?
* **Harry Potter**: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.
* **Artemis Fowl series**: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. 

Books I like:

* **Mistborn**: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.
* **Same for everything else written by Butcher**: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.
* **Legend of Drizzt**: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **Iron Druid series** I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **The Shadow of What was Lost** : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book.

Do not like: 

* **Name of the Wind** As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.
* **Monster hunter international** Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.
* Tried **The Malazan Book of the Fallen**: just couldn't get into the story.
* And all my friends keep begging me to give the **Dark Tower Series** another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.

467	"**Gay panic defense**

The gay panic defense is a legal defense, usually against charges of assault or murder. A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent temporary insanity because of a purported psychiatric condition called homosexual panic. The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.

Trans panic is a similar defense applied towards cases where the victim is a transgender or intersex person.

468	"No, you seriously aren't understanding what mainstream Muslims believe and I don't blame you, many people on the Internet share this naive and sophomoric view of Islamic doctrine. Most Muslims do not get their religious knowledge from the Quran, in terms of what Muslims practice, the Quran has little to do with it. The fact is that most Muslims do not read the translation of the Quran and even if they did, it's not easily understood without some hadith to support it and give it context like what conditions it must be followed in etc. This is why most Muslims rely on hadith and teachings that are passed down, hadith is much simpler to understand and that's what most Muslims follow. Most Muslims agree that the Quran itself is not enough to understand and practice Islam and even the hadith can be slightly problematic in terms of reliability and contradictions. This is why they rely on fiqh, the four schools of thought hanafi, hanbali, maliki and shafi have simplified the teachings into reliability and made rulings on what's permissable or not permissable. All sunni Muslims follow one of the four schools of thought, except the people who identify as just sunni as sunni means a follower of the sunnah and sunnah is the way of Muhammad. There are slight disagreements between the four fiqhs but generally they're close and they aren't really regarded as wrong by other schools of thought. The problem with contemporary issues is that scholars and imams make rulings based on implications e.g TV being wrong, cartoons, etc. This is one of the reasons why some Muslims say certain things are prohibited whilst doing other things. Again, what Muslims do and do not follow is heavily based on culture. A hanafi Muslim in UK who follows his religion is very different from a hanafi Muslim in Pakistan. They both follow the same school of thought but it's society and culture which influences the lifestyle. There's also not a lot to ""remove"" half the things in the Quran that seem violent go along with the context of hadith, some other things have been examined by the fiqh and contemporary scholars and by cross referencing hadith, the verses have been redefined. E.g there's an importance of God's law which must be followed, then there's hadith saying sharia law for you living in a non Muslim country is to follow the laws of the land. "	0.0

593	"Proudhon's phrase ""property is theft"" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property.

If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that *anything* was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism.

Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:

&gt; Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint.  
For the moment, he is still drinking beer,  
Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water.  
When others cry savagely ""down with the kings""  
Stirner immediately supplements ""down with the laws also.""  
Stirner full of dignity proclaims;  
You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free.  
You become accustomed to slavery  
Down with dogmatism, down with law.  
  
Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give *indirect* platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ).

I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the *least* keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - 1) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and 2) It's ability to distribute consensus has *so much more* potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth). So much so that I imagine almost any modern anarcho-*communist* society would also want base their communications upon it."	1.0

I use vegetable oil often.  Inexpensive and gets the job done.

Butter is an absolute must for some dishes.  I enjoy cooking pancakes and French toast.  You don't want to cook those in olive oil.

I bake bread with lard.  Yep, lard.  It adds to the flavor and nothing makes a proper crust the way lard will.

Don't limit yourself.  Use the right oil for the job.  Be sure to try lard, it isn't that bad for you and it is positively wonderful when used correctly.  I buy lard from a local Mexican market.  They render it right there.  There's nothing better."	0.0

617	"Yeah, great club. I walked in one blustery MLK day a few years back after leaving what I thought was a jazz concert but wasn't, in the theater on 92nd &amp; caught a great piano, bass &amp; drum trio. I was on a 1st date, there was no 2nd, so I humbly asked to sit in. The pianist graciously agreed &amp; we settled on Miles' ""Four"". 


Then the pianist picked up a trumpet &amp; the drummer counted off at an insane tempo. I get it, see if the new kid can keep up. I did, praise God, &amp; they were very cool, asked if I wanted to do another but it was time to go so I promised I'd be back. 


All in all, a fun time and world class players, to be sure. Plying my trade in Palm Beach these days. Love NYC, hate winter. There are a number of jazz venues down here but not like up north. I'm excited to see Joey DeFrancesco next month in Ft. Lauderdale. 


I recently picked up a 1946 Hammond CV &amp; am studying with Tony Monaco via Skype. Whoever tells you, piano/organ, same thing, all keys, doesn't have a clue. Playing Jimmy Smith style requires bass lines in LH leaving only 5 fingers to make the changes. As a pianist for over 1/2 century, standard MO is splitting chord tones between RH/LH, I'm going insane attempting to visualize chords voiced 100% differently.


For the most part I keep my root-7 in the LH on piano using RH for the color tones. On Hammond, I play the color tones in RH but 3-7 is missing. Inserting them in the bass line isn't the same thing. A truly humbling experience but Tony is on a 3-4 week Asian tour &amp; I'm working on ""Song For My Father"". Really digging ""Groove"" Hoimes' version, as Tony's, Joey's &amp; others. If you know of any other hip Hammond versions, turn me on to them, please. 


In any case, nice to meet you. Love to share ideas for sub changes, rearm, etc. Stay in touch. Peace."	0.0

619	"&gt;In its original meaning, the term denoted a man of the lowest rank of the English gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers and the younger sons of baronets, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession, and thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. In this sense, the word equates with the French gentilhomme (""nobleman""), which latter term has been, in Great Britain, long confined to the peerage. Maurice Keen points to the category of ""gentlemen"" in this context as thus constituting ""the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France"".

Heavensward is a lot better tho, and if it could be judged on its own I'd say itd be somewhere around like FF5 quality story, or somewhere in the middle. FFXIV handles its story as one continuous flow tho (unlike the other MMO FFXI which does it in episodic arcs) so the story never seems to get peaceful resolutions that last very long.. which makes for very dismal storytelling. They also have a habit of overdoing drama and killing off characters so often, many of whom we don't get a chance to be invested in.. so yea.. meh.

I got the VIP ticket and we have an early access to the place along with Q&amp;A session with her, some merch and a pre-show/soundcheck. But she became sick 2 days before the concert and lost her voice so she canceled her shows for NY and Cleveland. I won passes for a pizza party with her at a radio station but I was told it was canceled due to her condition. I thought the concert was canceled as well, then around 1pm I realized nobody has emailed me about the cancelation and started freaking out. My only transportation there is a train ride that goes for 1hr and 20min, and the VIP ticket holders have to be there by 4 or we'll miss the whole program set for us. I got there around 5:30, I was crying in the train on the way there too. I went in and told them I'm a VIP and the lady named Victoria was the one who gave me my ticket and merch. She told me to wait for a few minutes and she'll be back. She came back and told me to follow her, she asked why I was late and I told her everything. She also told me how Alessia's been feeling and that they didn't do the soundcheck to preserve her voice for the show tonight. She then followed up with ""so, how about a private, one-on-one meet and greet with her?"" in my head I started freaking out and she took me to her dressing room. It was the craziest thing ever. When she came up the first words that came out of my mouth were ""are you okay? How are you?"" all she can do was mouth the words ""yeah, I'm doing okay. Hopefully I can sing tonight"". I gave her my gift, took pics with her and have her signed some stuff. She's the sweetest and most down to earth famous person I've ever met. She then hugged me and said ""I hope to see you out there"". A few minutes after I left she then tweeted and DMed me on Twitter. That was just insane. Got front row seats and met the coolest high schoolers lol. So that's my weekend. I'm still having post concert depression.

662	"Honestly? Most things. I've worked as a cook and there's really not much difference between a skilled chef at home or in a commercial kitchen.

The main difference is economy of scale. There are many dishes that I would use 3 separate pans for in a kitchen but only 1 for at home to save time on cleanup and be able to multi task easier. The same with industrial ovens, dozens of knives (although you still use a chef's knife for 95% of things), etc.

Plating and decoration make food look better even when it's not, I usually skip that at home but the food's the same quality.

Ingredient selection is definitely hampered at home, without wholesale prices and the guarantee that I'll use expensive things before they expire, but that's something that can be partially avoided with planning, or just tolerated if I really want to make a knockout dish.

So what CAN I make better than a restaurant? Most everything. What DO I make better, on a day to day basis? Not many things."	0.0

705	"You should never assume that the person you having a discussion with is dumber than you are. I read your comment but I think you're misusing the term false equivalency.

To reiterate, I think one-mindedness comes from being in power for a long time. I believe the as more time passes the Republicans will eventually conform around specific goals and work rather cohesively. That may be around the WH or it may not. It kind of depends on what their constituents want.

I know that the RNC has many fractions. What I'm saying very bluntly is that if they can't figure out those fractions is screwed because then they'll accomplish nothing and lose power.

The reason why comparing the RNC to the DNC isn't false equivalency, in summary, is because they were ""hired"" to a do the same job; run the country.

The the RNC can't figure out a way to do that effectively then they're not doing their jobs and people who vote R will become and should become pissed off.

As for Trump, he needs to keep campaigning on it. He should keep on message and repeating that message until the job gets done. 

Without that focus and effort the RNC gets to fight among itself and get nothing done.

Just imagine that Trump laid down a clear idea of what Trumpcare was, what you would get and why it was better. Not just Obamacare sucks but ""this is my plan. This is why it's better.""

707	"False. There is a very good reason for it's reclassification.

Pluto is just one of many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).

When Pluto was discovered and classified as a planet, we didn't know that these other very similar and very close together bodies existed.

If we classify Pluto as a planet, then we have to classify many (or all) of the other KBOs as planets to avoid arbitrarily picking just one or two of them and calling them planets.

And since we're letting the Kuiper Belt Objects in on the planetary action, we'd be forced to look at the Asteroid Belt again. The same process that happened with Pluto and the other KBOs *already happened* with Ceres and the other Asteroids in the 19th century. The first few Asteroids were considered planets until we realized there's tons of them, and they all far more resemble each other than they do planets. 

If we count all of them then we're left with a mess of hundreds or thousands of planets. So instead of that, the IAU decided to follow prior precedent, and Pluto and the other KBOs went the way of the Asteroids. Unlike the KBOs and Asteroids, the 8 planets are all *unique.*"	0.0

I figured out a way to prove i wasn't smurfing.  Feel free to pause the gif at any time to see what I'm talking about. First, on the bottom left, you see my name is ""Musty"". Next, I pull up overwolf which shows my ranks. It correctly displays my 1100+ unranked mmr and champ 3+ ranks in every playlist which corresponds with my [rocketleaguetracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/amustycow) ranks. Make sure you look at the last part of my steam ID on rocketleagueracker. It's the same name as my reddit account. Next, I shift+tab to pull up the steam menu which shows my recent games. You may need to pause here. It shows that I played someone named ""Maze"" 1 day ago which corresponds with the name of my opponent in the post. You can also see that I have 43 friends online. I don't know many people that have 43 friends on a smurf, let alone all of them being online. The next scene shows that I have 581 hours on record. (I moved from xbox 3 months ago and had around 1700 hours on xbox.) Also, it shows i have 91 hours in the past 2 weeks. That's over 6 hours a day. I don't know many people that have that amount of playtime on a smurf. Also in this scene you can see the end of my steam profile which corresponds with both my reddit username and my [rocketleaguetracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/amustycow) url

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

So they get distracted by Netflix and Marvel Movies and all other sorts of low-impact information. It's a *Brave New World* sort of argument, I guess. There's too much information out there for any one person to sift through, so they just don't bother. As you say, if they ever need it, they just ask Siri, why bother paying attention? 

OR they do, but they focus on simple, high-emotion stories and ignore the complex underlying mechanisms and laws at work. They don't need to know about that, they just need to get outraged and demand that something be done. In lieu of building a better world (which takes effort and a solid understanding of reality) they complain about the world they got and hope somebody else fixes it.

Take, for instance, this whole hullabaloo around the Fine Brothers, rather than targeting the underlying IP system that enables them to even do what they're doing.

The nice thing is that the internet has the ability to teach you good information AND the tools to make use of such information for your own advancement. I try to make this sub such a place. But you have to have some level of underlying intelligence to bootstrap into rational thinking.

1096	"One option is something like [this](https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/litebeam-ac/), which is ridiculously cheap for what you get (about $50–60 USD). Then, you run it into the uplink port on a normal WiFi router to serve your computers, phones, etc. If you're getting 300 m range there's probably a rooftop outdoor antenna serving that part of campus, so you could point a dish at that. The Ubiquiti devices have a built-in strength monitor that you can see on your laptop while you assist them.

However, that model would only work if they have 5 GHz support at your campus, and it might be wishful thinking to get a5 GHz signal from a sector antenna from that far away. There are also 2.4 GHz options, which would be somewhat bigger and probably more expensive.

Storage Pool

A storage pool can consist of heterogeneous physical disks. Notice that a physical drive in the context of Windows Server 2012 Storage Space is simply raw storage from a variety of types of drives including USB, SATA, and SAS drives as well as an attached VHD/VHDX file as shown below. With a storage pool, Windows Server 2012 presents the included physical drives as one logical entity. The allocating the capacity of a storage pool is to first create a virtual disk based on the storage pool followed by creating and mapping a volume Later a drive letter or an empty folder. And with the mapping, the volume based on a virtual disk of a storage pool will appear and work just like a conventional hard drive or folder in Windows Explorer.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."	0.0

I mostly agree.  

Also, obviously, Trump IS a bit over the top in his actions, but what better choice is there?  

Hilary, with her lies and political dicksuckery?  

Jeb, with his turtles and guac?  

Bernie, with his unrealistic pipe dream liberal-land promises?  

Who else is a realistic candicate?  

This is why I say that Trump seems to be the top candidate.  

I like how you said that 'people couldn't handle weed'.  I agree wholeheartedly.  The government has a responsability to sway people to do certain things, as to not harm themselves or everyone else, or cause harm by inaction.  

I feel like a president is someone that knows many people, knows how the world works, and knows what is best for the people, kind of like a good, stern parent.  

Hilary seems to be an absentminded soccer mom sipping on her frappe, Jeb seems like an autistic kid obcessed with turtles and guac, and Bernie seems to be a pothead that thinks 'love is all you need man', thinking that people have the ability to have self-control and provide their justified part in the system as a whole.  

Trump knows what's best for the nation, at least on the economics side of it, which is likely the single largest point of focus for the US, moving through the years when the EU dissolves, China falls, and mass refugee problems are abundant.

I have been fortunate though to play in a very good off-season comp. All teams consist of players in the highest tier of grades so the games are just as hard, if not harder, than winter season.

The other benefit of playing off-season is it helps to maintain game fitness.  May not be the same as your off-season comp but I would recommend giving it a shot!

As for stick skills, I know plenty of players who will focus on tapping the ball at the end of their stick and practice dribbling skills in the backyard. Hard to do much if you don't have much room but these basics will help with hand-eye coordination and to speed up basic skills."	0.0

As I've said before I think this is the only gacha game many people on this sub play. They do not understand just how crappy most of the others are. KLab does not have an obligation to give us better rates or even free stuff for that matter- but they choose to give us a ton of free stuff. At this point I don't care that is wasn't as good as last year- we got something- and it wasn't even that bad.

I spent an entire year without a single chappy or other good 5 star accessory to my name- i got beat down like no other in 4th seat repeatedly-I like you just got blue Kenny today and I might finally have a viable chance at 3rd seat. But I have never been mad about my ""misfortune"" I just worked with what I had, managed my orbs wisely (since I don't use money outside of the few steals we had for 4.99) , and most importantly had fun with the game. 

I guess I would just say to those that are really unhappy - the game is great and nothing in life is perfect- if you aren't having fun or are extremely unhappy with a game/developer take a break and maybe you will enjoy the game again on your return!

We went to this old plantation that has a church on the grounds.  We go their a couple times a year because it's old and creepy, and people have experiences there.  Personally I don't tend to believe any one else's experience except my own, and my fiancé because I feel we are the most level headed people in the group.  Mine may not be the most exciting experience, but its one of the very few that I have experienced that I 100% believe was paranormal.  

 I was in the church that was supposed to be haunted, and after sitting there quietly we (a group of about 4) began to hear what sounded like footsteps. At first I just rationalized it as the church settling or whatnot but it really did sound like heavy footsteps, even with a sort of heel-to-toe sound. So I sat in the middle of the aisle where I had been hearing them and you could hear the footsteps walk away from me and towards me. I did scream once because the footstep were so loud (almost stomping) and it was RIGHT beside me. I even felt the floor beneath me vibrate a little.

We're also coming at this from different perspectives. You're assuming sexist advice is always bad advice. When colleges and courts and the news don't assume by default that men are rapists waiting to pounce, then advice telling men to avoid being caught with their pants metaphorically or literally down in situations that put them in a bad light, even and especially if they are innocent will be meaningless. Until then, I think it's pretty solid advice.

Besides, if we're talking about rejecting reality, your proposed solution seems to be ""hope things will work out for the best and that no one will screw you over because they maybe won't."" And maybe they really won't. But it won't cost much to prep as if they will and it'll save you if they do. "	0.0

1396	You know, i keep bringing this up to my buddies. The problem with tanks was never them being tanky. They're supposed to be. The problem with them is they share base damage values and %scaling with mages, instead of you know, doing less damage because they're tanks. The justification for this is that supports tend to be behind due to xp and leveling. So what's the obvious answer to these problems? nerf base damage values and change how proximity xp/gold is given, thus putting not only supports, but junglers in a better place to teamfight? No, nerf cooldown, nerf armor and health values, and nerf select CC gods while leaving other problematic ones untouched. It just really really confuses me that they'd absolutely destroy their set meta that was so close to being balance outside of a few problem gods, and instead completely destroy the balance of the game to try something that seems to not be working for the most part. Jungle now seems like a lane partner instead of a ganker, supports end up roaming far more often in order to get more xp to stay relevant, and most god options for jungle have been severely reduced to a key few that offer the instant burst of damage needed to kill someone, then quickly return to your lane partner mid. The entire meta so far just seems like incredible backtrack to s1 early s2 which is what we spent all of s2 trying to get away from.	0.0

1411	"Welcome! First I recommend checking out the Wiki tab here on reddit to read a brief overview of the most important systems. Its not fully filled out yet sorry, but some info there to help you get started.

Second, watch the getting started videos on iRacings Youtube page. Some of these are out of date a bit, but still helpful nonetheless.

Third, read the sporting code once you become a member. This will cover everything.

&gt; Best deal

There are a few new member deals floating around. A couple are listed over in the sidebar here ---&gt; Not sure if any are still active though.

&gt; how not to anger people as a new driver

Practice a lot before you race and treat people as you would want to be treated. Ill just say that you already have a big leg up on many new drivers in that you understand the simple concept of empathy. Some people just drive like there arent other humans in the other cars.

In terms of practice time, it depends on how skilled you are. Do you have any background at all in sim racing or is iRacing your first venture into this world? Do you have any background in understanding motorsports in general. Do you watch racing? Do you understand racing concepts (drafting, cornering, apex, etc)? If you answered no to any of these questions, you might need to spend more time than others educating yourself. On the other hand If you have plenty of prior experience and knowledge, getting competent wont take too long. Getting fast though takes awhile. For example, I had a long history with sim racing games from the time I was a young kid and it took me close to a year to really get competitive with the fastest guys. iRacing is like nothing else out there.

&gt; how to get set-ups

1. Make your own

2. Some people share theirs on the forum, you can download from there.

3. [SetupSync](http://iracingsetupsync.nickthissen.nl/). A wonderful application made by a fellow member for sharing and downloading setups. There are thousands of setups available on there for most any car/track combo."	0.0

Fair enough. He's been pretty open that he's doing that so China will cooperate on North Korea, though. I support him flip-flopping.

&gt;taking calls from the president of Taiwan, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,” and ""These dummies say, 'Oh, that's a trade war. Trade war? We're losing $500 billion in trade with China. Who the hell cares if there's a trade war?”

You offered to give sources, so I'd like to see sources on him ""flip-flopping"" on any of these things. As far as I know, he never promised to not take calls from Taiwan. 

&gt;On intervention in Syria, another reversal. NATO's also suddenly not obsolete anymore.

Also the scene of her and Toby when Toby said ""you finished the game"" and Spencer(or Alex) says ""oh I don't remember the word I put"" that was sketchy because when they were talking, she seemed to be in a rush. 

I feel like the kidnapping scene where Mona hit Spencer, was suppose to happen before the dinner. Then that would've made more sense on why it was Alex at the dinner, and not Spencer.

1455	"Yeah! I have had these same two for many years. They are what I use daily, sometimes 6-8 hours in a stretch. They are both Singers. The lightweight is a 20u, which is a zigzag and straight stitch. The heavy duty is a 531b, which is straight stitch only. I believe Consew has a model just like the 531b; i think the singer was actually made by consew. I bought them both used, and just make sure to take them to the machine spa for their tune up regularly. They are FAST, which is why I love them. The lightweight is only light compared to the heavy duty (I call him The Beast) because it can sew through multiple layers of vinyl or canvas. The Beast, I am convinced, would sew through a finger, though I've yet to test that theory. 
It's been a while since I bought them, but if I remember correctly, I paid about $600 for Beast, and maybe $3-600 for The Little One?  I found her on Craigslist, and drove about an hour to pick her up. They are crazy heavy, as the motor is attached to the table, and you just pull the machine head off and take that part to the repair shop. I've had these two for so long, they feel like an extension of my hands :). 

If you have a sewing machine shop anywhere near you, go in and try some out. If you don't, keep an eye on Craigslist and go visit it. Don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't feel like the right machine for you. They are great machines, but I walked away from one because it hadn't been cared for and it wasn't worth the risk to me. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm actually sitting with The Little One right now, working on a quilt at night. Let me know if you have any other questions! "	0.0

The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much.

Once upon a time there was an 18 year old man who really *really* loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it.

Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her.

'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love.

Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well.

Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak.

The man knew what he had to do.

""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything! The wedding was saved!

""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment.

""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan.""

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

And while I am depressed at times I can't imagine a life without the love of my life. It may sound selfish to some but everyone is different handles things differently.

Inga sådan åtgärder togs eller ens diskuterades när det fortfarande var vänstern som dominerade.

1754	Early game: khepri has better clear and lane pressure, along with a stronger level 1-4. Get suffers in the early game due to lack of clear and pressure, since the shield is garbage early. If you are looking for a snowball duo lane then pick khepri over geb.   Mid game: khepri's mitigation becomes very useful, and his pull can guarantee a kill. Geb shield starts to come online and can provide better peel    Late game: here is where the 2 gods separate in role. Geb has a much better initiation and can set up team fights and picks more easily than khep. Khepri is better at extending team fights because of his ult and can provide better late game peel from the root/pull, where as geb can guarantee more survivability.   Conclusion: both gods are top tier supports. They both provide different things to a team comp and can be picked on preference. I think it is very ignorant for you to say that khepri is bad since he has one of the biggest pick ban rates in the spl and can change a team fight in many ways. If you are looking to snowball out of the duo lane pick khepri. If you want to farm until late game pick geb. They both do their role well, and because of that u can't say that khepri is bad. Kuzembo is a bad support because he lacks everything. Sure u can say that one is bad compared to the other but that doesn't make him unpickable which is what u seem to be saying. 	0.0

Everything, because it's total and complete bullshit. No-one has done anything to you, but your group has terrorised women for a year and half.

I'd always been involved with the chapel band at my school (private Christian school) as a vocalist and watching that show brought back lots of memories of being in a ""band"". After finishing the show, I decide if a klutz like Yui could pick up the instrument, so could I. I've been playing for about a year and a half now but only started taking lessons with a good teacher about four months ago. I'm progressing and am excited about the prospect of writing my own material. Vocals were always somewhat easy for me but now that I'm gaining another tool, music is a whole new thing for me.

This was over four years ago and still haunts me.

I was at the eighth grade dance. I didn't have very many friends in middle school, so I was just kind of dancing by myself in the center of the mash. I hear from behind me a loud ""Yeah, Adam!"" and I turn around to see its the girl I had had a crush on for basically the entire year. Before this moment, I don't think I'd even had a conversation with her. We make eye contact, and she turns around, pointing her butt in my direction, an obvious invitation to grind (yes, it was one of those dances, the whole thing was a disgusting mess. Of course, I didn't think so at the time). Now, I had been a fairly sheltered kid. I had no idea why she was doing that or what I was supposed to do. She dancing a little, going up and down, looking back waiting for me to do something. 
Then it dawned on me, I knew exactly what to do. 

I turned my back to her, backed up into her, and we rubbed backs for a solid ten seconds. She turned around with the most wtf look on her face and disappeared into the mob of people.

1990	"We adopted a cat a few months ago, so we're still getting to know him. He's about 18 months old, give or take. When we brought him home, he seemed like a regular cat, but we quickly realized that he's super smart. 

He can open our shutters; he works a paw between two of the louvers and pushes them up or down until the whole shutter is open, so he can watch the birds in the backyard. 

We've got a wall niche where he loves to hang out, so he's up off the floor. There are light switches on one side, and after seeing someone turn on a light ONCE, he pawed at the switches. Of course he got a reaction from us, so now he regularly plays with the switches to make us laugh. 

Any door or drawer that is even half a centimeter open is likely to end up being opened and investigated. He's ended up in some pretty interesting hideouts. 

He's amazing at playing fetch -- his favourite toys are pompoms from the dollar store, but he'll retrieve just about anything if he's in the mood. 

He knows what birds are -- if you say there are birds in the backyard, he'll go to the window to watch (his favourite thing). Better yet, if I grab my laptop and ask him 'want to watch birds?' he will start meowing, then run over to curl up in my lap and watch a youtube channel I found that shows birds and squirrels at a feeder (it's actually designed for cats to watch when owners aren't home). 

When we realized how bright he was, I decided to deliberately train him to do some things, to keep his mind busy so he wouldn't be bored and wreck the house. Within two weeks he had learned to 'come', 'sit', 'beg', 'shake a paw', and 'gimme five' -- he's a cat, so he'll only work for treats and only if he's in the mood, but it's still astonishing to me that he's so incredibly trainable. 

Edit -- I forgot his best 'trick'; he saw one of us turn on one of the roombas, and because he LOVES to chase them around he figured out that he could push the button on top twice in a row and make the vacuum start up any time he chose. Now every once in a while we'll hear him take off downstairs and pounce on the vacuum so he can stalk it. People tend not to believe us until they see him do it, but he seems to like to show off this particular trick for guests. Several times now we've been visiting with someone in the living room and the cat will just appear... meow... swat the vacuum... then deliberately paw the button. My mother-in-law went nuts, she just couldn't believe it -- 'that wasn't an accident, he had to push the button two times! Oh my god! You need to get that on video!' We're definitely going to try, but it's tough since most of the time he does it at 1am when we're asleep! :D  "	0.0

2054	"Write Music was the main guy in Noble.... Far from. If anyone was the true leader of the clan it was Super Nice and me and him co lead it. 

Stop trying to suck up to him, just because he's essentially telling you what you want to hear. It's what I used to say you did with Dragz. You overate him as a player so much. It's because he was a big part (even essential) in creating the modern PTC. 

Write music simply told you that noble is filled with cowards.... so what 1 person (who btw hardly played with noble) now proved everything. Ever thought about how he clearly has a grudge with me?? It's why he said all that stuff. 

You completely overate how laggy Noble was while discrediting PTCs lag. 

You fine well know inspire, steez, Dragz, Han and keytro have been called laggers time and time again. 

You also have NO IDEA. who was in Noble. If your going to take 1 thing from this stop telling me who was in noble. Japs didn't play with NOBLE. I used to play with japs along with Dragz and supernice.... BEFORE NOBLE. 

Almighty was never in noble. 

Pinda wasn't either. 

Also you don't understand how people like Akira came into the clan. Of course he wasn't recruited. But it was when Titan split up. Players got thrown around, people's were friends etc. You couldn't split everyone up. Noble black was nobles top 8 players. That 8 has as much lag as your top8

Straps stop trying to discredit me. It's ridiculous. You fine well know what you said to me while in PTC. about how people overate my lag. Y don't you make a fuss about inspire?? He used to lag TERRIBLY and you knew it. 

You had months to fight noble. MONTHS it does not take that long to set up a match. If both parties want to play a match, regardless of time zones/jobs/school. The time can be found. I've played enough clan matches to know. 

Noble or PTC were not better than each other. 

There were weak links and carry players. 

PTC was nothing without you, me of steez. SS was right they absolutely would of beaten PTC without those 3 players. Same with Noble of it wasn't for me and Supernices defence the clan would of been nothing, obviously would of been a great clan, but the best? no. 

So forget the clans. The clans don't hold any value really. 

I didn't get tired of you saying you were the best. It was your constant discredit of Noble. Most of the stuff your saying straps isn't true. Of course noble had lag like pretty much everyone. but it was exaggerated, exactly the same with PTC. 

Noble was NOT a clan when we fought. It's the same question, why was flukes PTC when we clan matched??? because Noble wasn't a clan that's why. "	0.0
2055	"[Tawn and Amethyst] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rwbyRP/comments/40zg75/the_great_indoors/cyyf9vl) met again after Tawn knocked a ball into the room and pegged her in the head. The two then talked about how each other had been and played but the major moment of talk when Tawn explained that he lived in a box when he was younger. After that, he noticed Amethyst's weapon and showed her he used something similar in the form of a sharpened wrench that he made for ranged capabilities. Their social short comings kept them from connecting until they played. After a short round of roughhousing that left Amethyst unable to move on the floor. The two talked about their experiences and lead Tawn to invite Amethyst to a pasta night with him and his team after giving her one of his sharpened wrenches that the girl was enamored with earlier.

*****
&gt; Ivanka Trump, the president&amp;#039;s daughter, and Jared Kushner, her husband, had pushed the president to hire Mr. Scaramucci, seeing him as a way to force out Mr. Priebus, the former national Republican committee chairman, and his allies in the West Wing.In that, Mr. Scaramucci was successful.

&gt; Mr. Scaramucci&amp;#039;s swift departure is an early indication that Mr. Kelly intends to assert his authority over the operations of the White House, and that several of the big personalities there - including Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump and Mr. Bannon - may be inclined to defer to him.

&gt; The president still values Mr. Scaramucci, according to people close to Mr. Trump and his family, and is hoping to find another, less high profile, position for him in the White House - although it is uncertain if Mr. Scaramucci would be willing to accept a demotion.

Although none of these stories directly translate to modern markets, they teach the critical lessons that you must find your own way, and that you will pay your price in metaphorical blood to be successful. It's not enough just to hear those sentences to understand what is actually before you, but reading the stories of people who have made it can help get you closer.

2165	"A guardian angel to those who come under her care, Dr. Angela Ziegler is a peerless healer, a brilliant scientist, and a staunch advocate for peace.
After obtaining her MD and PHD in Switzerland, Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.

Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.

During her Overwatch years, she once dressed as a witch for Halloween.

Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. One example was the development of the biotic rifle by Torbjörn. Torbjörn provided assurances that the device was only intended for healing, but Ziegler maintained that this was setting Overwatch down a road that could lead to the weaponization of biotic technology, and that she had only conducted research in the field on the condition that it would not be used for offensive purposes.

Seven years before the present day, Ziegler was involved in an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander Jack Morrison to end the King's Row Uprising in London, England. Earlier the same day, Ziegler argued with Morrison over Overwatch's inability to intervene in the conflict due to the English prime minister expressively forbidding of any Overwatch action within the United Kingdom. Dr. Ziegler expressed her concern for the thousands in the city who needed medical aid, and lamented how Overwatch was made to help people, not sit on the sidelines. After Jack authorized the mission, while preparing to board an aircraft, Ziegler welcomed Cadet Lena Oxton to the team. She commented on how her inspirational words convinced Jack to authorize the mission, and how he was very invested in her career, and had asked Ziegler to keep an eye on her. Zigler then told Oxton how she could call on her if she ever needed any help.

In Overwatch's final days, the group was faced with a series of allegations, and Ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the United Nations. In light of the fight between Overwatch members Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, Ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable. They had drifted further and further apart ever since Morrison had been chosen over Reyes for the position of strike commander, and that rift had widened despite her efforts.

Mercy helps the innocent
When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by war. Though she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled, hoping to make a more peaceful world.

When Winston issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Mercy was in the Middle East. Mercy was unsure if Overwatch should be restored.

Hope that helps.

When my scalp gets flanky/itchy....I will actually lose sleep and when I did sleep, I'd scratch my scalp till I'd find blood under my fingernails. I've gone to dermatologists, removed sulfate shampoos, tried natural ingredients  (tea tree, neem oil, etc), tried salicylic acid shampoos, coal tar shampoos, the zinc compund head and shoulders uses, selenium sulfide shampoos....the whole friggin gambit. Here's what works for me: first thing, i never wash my hair the same way twice. Mixing it up somehow helps. My shower looks like a crazy person's because I use so many different products in rotation. Then I do a multi-step process that seems to work. First I use a generic shampoo in a quick and dirty way that kind of breaks up the oil in my hair. Then I use a salicylic acid shampoo (dermarest, specifically.) The chemical exfoliation helps the next step work better. Then I rotate between a 4% rx ketakonazole shampoo, coal tar shampoo and head and shoulders. Hope this helps.	0.0

2262	"So I've found this post about the same topic, discussed from a Japanese speaker's point of view:

http://cpplover.blogspot.jp/2012/12/blog-post_18.html

There's a link to this /r/anime thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14z01e/looking_for_instances_of_an_often_used_quote_that/c7hqldn

Which leads us to this /r/bestof thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14zw76/alayavijnana_explains_the_meaning_behind_the_he/

I don't have the time to read all these posts so here's my answer.

殺す is 'to kill' and 死ぬ is 'to die.'

「彼は殺しても死なない」 literally means ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""  

You will find translations like ""You couldn't kill him if you tried"" because the English sentence I gave above apparently doesn't sound natural.  Literal translation would still be ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""

The Japanese sentence 「彼は殺しても死なない」 is as self-contradictory as ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him"" but somehow feels natural.  In short, I think it's more about what kind of a sentence feels natural rather than the implications of the words 殺す/kill and 死ぬ/die.

I haven't thought this through but this might somehow be related to the ""Japanese doesn't have sarcasm"" trope.   Or I might be completely off the mark.  I must go out now...

This just isn't a good idea. You have to attack the problem at it's core. Rage quitters are not the issue you are trying to address here. It is salty/toxic players. 

For example, you miss a save. Your teammate ""what a saves"" you and votes to forfeit. You don't vote and so he just leaves. That player is clearly willing to give up 15 minutes. If we include some time of increasing time length ban and that person then isn't willing to give up 2 hours (or whatever) of time, in all likelihood they're just gonna stay and be toxic. Play against you. Drive around aimlessly. Talk trash in chat etc. Is that any better than if they had just rage quit? You have to understand that if someone who doesn't want to play is forced to play, in most cases they aren't really gonna try to play productively and win. Additionally, we can't forget about what will happen to all the people who have an unfortunate week of power outages, wifi drops game crashes etc, and are suddenly hit with an hour long ban even though they never rage quit once.

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it. 

&gt;THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

Example: if a car dealer sells a car he must include a warranty under law, so that sale is covered by law, but then if the dealer says no actually you have to pay an extra $x or i'm not delivering that car he can do that and is not violating any law."	0.0

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of?

2385	"Canadian tax rates are such that two couples, both earning a total of 100k/year, could be taxed very differently depending upon how evenly the total income is split between the two spouses. For example, a couple where both spouses make 50k/year will pay less tax than a couple where one spouse makes 100k/year with the second spouse having no income. 
As I understand it, spousal RRSP's were designed to allow the higher income spouse to put RRSP's in the lower income spouse's name in order to lessen the income gap and thus reduce the couple's taxes in retirement.
Since then however, those with a qualifying pension can elect to split their pension (for income tax purposes) and thus reduce the couple's income tax. A more direct and sure way of evening out a couple's income.  
Thus, it appears to me that since the introduction of pension splitting, spousal RRSP's have lost most (all? I am not a tax expert) their relevance. "	0.0

 &gt;Was given a physical coin a couple of years ago.  Didn't think much about it just planned on saving for a rainy day as I liked the idea of BTC even though I didn't really understand much of the tech.  Checked value a couple of weeks ago and surprised to see it's value go up so quickly hence I want to check its all legit.  The company/startup went bankrupt (seemed a bit shady when it closed with people seemingly owed money - hence my concerns).  Spent last couple of weeks overdosing on BTC threads, videos etc. trying to understand it but still not sure what to do.  I want to make sure all is super safe.  I checked the public key online and it is registered as 1BTC associated with it.  I'm paranoid as hell I may lose the coin and with it the private key behind the hologram which I have not removed.  I don't have any emails showing me it was logged anywhere or anything, nothing.. when they gave it to me explained the coin was a wallet... I'd feel much better if I could plug it into a USB or something but nope... just a coin with a key on the back.  I've waited too long to ask for help.  Deep breath... thanks in advance!"	0.0

I should've said ""It *came* true. Now what?""

And I still want an answer to that. Your ""False prophecy from Satan"" came true, and built up the body. Now what? Do we add to the Bible? No. Because Scripture DOES in fact carry greater weight than some specific Word for a specific time and place. Scripture (aka your precious ""canon"") is for all times and all places. Not all of God's Revelation is. Otherwise we'd have a record of what those poor, ""falsely prophesying"" 70 elders said.

Lastly, I'm not talking about a hypothetical with the whole ""it came true"". But it wasn't specific to my situation, so I haven't remembered all of it."	1.0
2471	"Grow up, dude. I answered your question respectfully.  If you disagreed you could've addressed me respectfully as well. However, I will be the bigger man here and respond to you like a human being.

(1) Many economists tie the 2008 recession directly to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.  The lack of separation between commercial and investment banks is likely tied heavily with the Recession. Things along these lines are difficult to prove though, as are many things economically.

(2) I, individually, don't have the right to limit power. But, as an American, I support and elect the people in the government. And the government does have the power to tax and limit power.  A tax on the richest of us (read: Wall Street) can be used beneficially to help the poorest of us. Robin Hood took from the rich to give to the poor. And the average person doesn't care about the globally economy of they're still dirt poor. And, because of income inequality, they're getting poorer, while the rich are getting richer. A Robin Hood tax could alleviate the wealth gap slightly.

(3) The fact that the media is owned by so few large corporations. The fact that in many areas you only have one choice for cable providers. I could go down the list. Monopolies exist. Many monopoly laws aren't being enforced. I don't need to create new monopoly laws.

(4) Yet, somehow, politicians still get paid tons of money from corporate donors. Look how many politicians on both sides of the isle are in bed with certain industries.

(5) Profits not being spent on improving the company should be taxed. They're doing no good and not helping the economy by sitting there. Do you really think that Exxon needs as big of a profit as it does?  Money should be put to use improving society, not locked away where no one can touch it.

(6) People do store their money in places like the Cayman Islands all the time. People, using creative tax ""loopholes,"" find ways to avoid paying taxes on their money by keeping it overseas. That needs to be stopped.

You don't have to agree with me. And, as I said, it's possible not all my ideas would work. I'm not an economist or an expert on the subject.

Now, rather than saying you disagree with my philosophy (it's clear that you have a more libertarian economic philosophy, which I don't agree with for a variety of reasons), why don't you say what you believe should be done to eliminate income inequality. Do you even think that's something that should be eliminated?"	1.0

I understand your frustration as I see it on a smaller scale when calling into my phone provider and get asked 15 things that I have already tested. 

It sounds like a CRM that would cross reference callers with their certificates could be beneficial so the support reps can have a better idea of the expertise that they are dealing with. This could already be in place but I am just unaware. I will look into it and,  if I can't find it,  I will bubble up the idea through management.

2589	"I hand painted with Vallejo for quite a while but now I'm switching to Tamiya. Vallejo is very forgiving in terms of brush strokes, but they're bad at sticking to the plastic (the primers are better, but still not great). Tamiya is harder to get an even finish with (retarder is supposed to help), but dries quickly and bonds well. With gunpla you're assembling painted pieces and posing, so being able to stand up to scuffs can make a difference. That said, the suggestion to use lacquer thinner is a good one if you don't mind the fumes. Vallejo does have a great color selection, plus lots of primers, varnishes, mediums, washes, etc. Whatever you choose I do recommend using a real thinner; water/alcohol aren't quite as nice.

I'd say get some cheap brushes that aren't bottom of the line, different sizes. Always use the largest brush you can for a piece, to minimize brush strokes. Invest in nice fine tip brushes for smaller details -- I like the gsi creos ones, you can get them thru Amazon. Strong, even bristles and predictable behavior will save you headaches when trying to paint the little stuff.

I use the alligator clips on sticks. I hold them by the clip while painting (sometimes challenging to find a place to clip it on) and put them back on the stick to cure.

2601	"&gt; No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful.

My viewpoints aren't even remotely offensive. If you've got a very thin skin, then yeah maybe my comments are rude and unwanted, but they certainly are very helpful comments.

&gt; I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit?

The views that I have aren't horribly offensive at all. Regarding women, I never said that they were ""worthless piles of shit."" It's just that Western societies like ours are under siege by feminists who say they want ""equal"" rights for women when they actually want female domination. Women are mentally and physically different from men and thus should not have the same rights that men have.

&gt; Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it.

Despite the number of downvotes that I get from cowardly, close-minded people like yourself, there are still a lot of people who agree with the things that I say. I believe everything that I write, and I'm sure that there are people out there who appreciate what I have to say.

You are far more likely in life to encounter steep drops then guns. 

And more likely to encounter a bike than a gun.

So your saying it makes more sense to just avoid those things if your not trained to use them correctly and safely?  You should avoid the edges of sharp drops, and not ride a bike in the street?  A rock wall isn't the only thing a kid might try to climb.  trees, buildings, bluff faces, fences...  shall I go on?

Kinda like you shouldn't handle a gun, and the solution is the same thing, but for one you want mandatory training?

2714	"I'm dual diagnosed.  Was on Vyvanse for 1.5 years, till I realized it was making me panicky and jittery...  (Think panic attack but the entire day...  But I just thought it was stress, since I only really take it during the academic year.)  It also was messing with my sleep, I think.  (I've never complained about it, thus never diagnosed, but anxiety is typically comorbid in ASD.  And Vyvanse is known to exacerbate anxiety in people who have anxiety issues.)

Since they are so often found together (ASD/ADHD + anxiety), I'd probably look more at how the meds affect people with anxiety (if this is also a problem for you), rather than how ADHD meds affect people with ASD.

No side-effects on Adderall (XR and IR), though it doesn't give me the energy that Vyvanse does.  I kind of wish I could combine them, but my psych said no.  :(  lol

Neither medication ever left me ""hyper,"" and both increased focus.  Though Adderall doesn't quite work as well as Vyvanse for me in that regard...  It's all about how each med affects you, specifically, because everyone's biology is different -- even if we have the same disorders.

I just don't want to watch the game slowly die again, be it from the game simply being out of touch with what the MMO crowd expects or because BPG runs it into the grounds.

2725	"I agree with Log, Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, Skeletons, Cannon and Ice Spirit being very powerful for their costs. 

I personally think Ice Golem is good where it's at, as a cheap mini tank/distraction unit/skeleton killer who does very little damage and no longer has a ridiculously large frost nova.

Cannon itself isn't too strong in my opinion, it's just that it's too similar to Tesla and thus replaces it any time someone looks to add a non-Inferno tower defensive building. To me, the solution is to buff Tesla, maybe by allowing it to hit two targets like Ewiz (no stun effect) and slowing it's hit speed accordingly so that it's DPS doesn't get insanely good.

Tombstone I feel is fine, definitely an annoying card especially if you're using Hog Rider or Elite Barbarians, but it's low hitpoints make it reasonably strong against ground tanks and troops. Maybe a slightly slower stream of Skeletons would be good, but that might kill the card's usage entirely.

Zap is a weird one because for the longest time it provided too much value, but after the damage nerf I think it's found a good niche as a reset card and Skeleton Army killer. The problem with Zap of being an easily overleveled common won't disappear unless the developers address that problem, so unfortunately overleveled Zaps will continue to be a nuisance. But in challenges, Zap is pretty balanced because it doesn't kill too much and the duration of it's stun isn't too long. The most frustrating part about going against Zap is how quickly it's deployed when compared to Arrows, which did receive the deploy time buff recently but still feel considerably slower. So perhaps a slight nerf?

2749	"please do supplement your food by taking advantage of community meals! generally food stamps cover fresh stuff (fruit, produce, meat/fish) and stuff that you need to expend effort to prepare (frozen fried chicken, yes; fried chicken from the deli counter that is cheaper, no)

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days.

2787	"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."	0.0

2) to cover, my process is first find midi versions of the song, and load them into a daw. Identify the imoortant/memorable parts of the song, and delete the rest. Make an arrangement that will work on the POs limited polyphony and number of patterns. Take advantage that you can repeat patterns if possible. Dont try to make a note for note cover. Instead, make a ""caricature"" of the song.

If notes/chords arent available on the PO, you may be able to play the song in a different key. If its only a few semitones different, no one will notice, and most people wont care anyways. Might not work for all songs, but should for many."	0.0

Right now, Apple is sitting on a huge pile of overseas cash and is simultaneously borrowing money in order to issue dividends because the foreign cash is taxable while the interest payments on the debt are tax deductible!

We want companies to think about how to maximize profits, not thinking about how to minimize their tax bills.

1. Black cleaver is a great item for the cdr and utility and you should probably build it every game. In the early game, you sacrifice a little bit of dmg compared to ghostblade but you should still be able to win lane with bc. The health will keep you alive esp vs true dmg opponents and 20% cdr is a ton. Can also buy a tiamat in between there if you feel you need more dmg. BC also helps transfer riven into the mid game.

2. Spirit Visage is still a viable option as it is gold efficient and offers really good components. However Maw and Scim are most often times going to be the way you want to go. The AD and MR offered by Maw is huge not to mention Moar armor pen, and the passive will give you more sustain than SV however you have to reach low health for it. Scimitar is also useful with the QSS tons of AD and lifesteal.

3. Although it definitely makes sense, it was a little surprising that everyone had the same exact answer of early hexdrinker vs ap match ups. SO DO IT

4. Deadmans is good for vsing a team without a lot of crit, and the moves peed passive is good on riven and helps with flanking. Randuins is good for the crit Champs like Yasuo, trynda, and some ADC aoe slow is really nice too.

5. This guy is still not someone you really wanna fight. I'd definitely recommend reading all the posts for this one but basically you want to kill him pre 6. Nidalee posted the build of BC&gt;Lifeel steal item&gt; Lord Dominik's Regard (LW)&gt;life steal item with lucidity somewhere in there. Try to roam.

6. It's more of preference. I personally like mid because most of your apponents are squishy but will often have cc to lock you down. Again hexdrinker is good here and QSS for Champs like Annie or Tf. Jungle riven is doable and fast Qing the minions is how u do it. However you should look to get rolling early as you fall off if you dont.

2856	There are many blacks-only and coloured-only towns but not on purpose. These towns simply haven't had any non-blacks or non-coloureds move into them. Orania and Kleinfontein are intentionally whites-only. If you're looking for examples: here's the town of [Bullettrap](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/364006) - a 100% coloured town in the Northern Cape and here's the town of [Allandale](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/276132) - 100% black. I have never found a 100% Asian town in South Africa, because, like Whites, they are never a majority in any municipality and therefore when apartheid ended a lot of non-Asians moved into their areas because they were of a better economic standing.

Natural 5's can come from heroic for sure. Not sure about heart summons. But they probably do too. Basics can only go for 1-4 stars IIRC.

On natural vs fused, naturals have generally higher stats than fused, hence why they are stronger. You'll see this once you get to compare your first natural and fused. You are guaranteed a natural 5 start in a month of playing.

&gt; all the different currency used to buy heroes.

* Gold - Most valuable resource in the late game. Very hard to come by. 

* Gems - Premium currency used to buy almost anything in-game

The other thing is that I'd probably be renting in an apartment building, so the landlord might be some random company rather than a real person who is willing to work with me.

One last thing, don't kill yourself over not having sex dude.  I guarantee you that it's not worth it, don't do that to yourself and your family.

2944	An excuse is standing somewhere between you and the next step you need to take. – If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way.  If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.  This may be tough to accept, but it’s the truth.  Stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  The only person who can truly hold you back is you.  So no more excuses – it’s time to change.  It’s time to choose what’s best for YOU.  Oftentimes when we feel stuck, we are waiting for something magical to happen.  We wonder when the winds will change in our favor.  We do this instead of embracing the present and admitting the change we need to make.  What is keeping you from stepping forward?  If not fear of failure, then what?  Insecurity?  Laziness?  What is your excuse?  We all have one.  And when we focus on our excuses more than our steps forward, we walk in a circle and fall into the familiar pit we call “Stuck.”	0.0

By posting my 8 + inch penis I provided proof that I'm not saying that because I'm butthurt about my small penis because I clearly don't have one and that the reason I said that is because I have seen how women feel about my penis.

Still though, this is a recipe she wrote, and when the chipotle powder she uses for it runs out, she's the one who orders more, and when customers complain about it, she's the one they talk to, meaning that she has to have heard the correct pronunciation hundreds of times throughout the time she's had it on the menu but she just doesn't care.	0.0

2987	"Hey there! Your title indicates that your survey is open to anybody who comes across it. Sometimes the questions that you ask can actually restrict the people who can answer your survey. Some common examples of this are marking a survey as open to everyone but requiring:

* which state they live in
* male or female for gender
* which way someone votes

It's okay to only want responses from a particular group of people (Americans, Males / Females, 18+); you just need to make sure that you are requesting those things in the demographic section of your survey title.

3015	How would they collect it, by trying to sue me? Does that happen often or is it not really practical?

I don't think it's fair to be on the hook for $12,000 (assuming $1,000/month which is cheap) for a place you haven't spent a night in.  The other thing is that I'd probably be renting in an apartment building, so the landlord might be some random company rather than a real person who is willing to work with me. In that case is it common for them to sue people to try to collect money? Do they have any authority to use collections agencies?	0.0

3024	That is the solution.  You're putting too much stock into sex, once you bang a hooker you will see that sex is just that, sex.  It will give you more confidence.  I don't know what you look like, but I'm willing to bet you're not the ugliest looking dude out there and I've seen some ugly ass guys with decent girlfriends.  One thing to remember, is that leagues and standards do matter.  If you make $30k a year, are fat, and don't much going for you; it's not reasonable to expect to hook up with a fine ass blonde or what have you.  Just something to consider.    One last thing, don't kill yourself over not having sex dude.  I guarantee you that it's not worth it, don't do that to yourself and your family. You will always pay for sex, whether it's with attention, emotional support, security, money, cars, houses etc...

3044	An excuse is standing somewhere between you and the next step you need to take. – If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way.  If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.  This may be tough to accept, but it’s the truth.  Stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  The only person who can truly hold you back is you.  So no more excuses – it’s time to change.  It’s time to choose what’s best for YOU.  Oftentimes when we feel stuck, we are waiting for something magical to happen.  We wonder when the winds will change in our favor.  We do this instead of embracing the present and admitting the change we need to make.  What is keeping you from stepping forward?  If not fear of failure, then what?  Insecurity?  Laziness?  What is your excuse?  We all have one.  And when we focus on our excuses more than our steps forward, we walk in a circle and fall into the familiar pit we call “Stuck.”	0.0

I am about everything else though... the dick is the only good thing on me, that's not the point... He implied that I said ""blacks don't have bigger dicks/ women usually don't even like big dicks"" because I have a small dick and I was saying that because I'm butthurt . By posting my 8 + inch penis I provided proof that I'm not saying that because I'm butthurt about my small penis because I clearly don't have one and that the reason I said that is because I have seen how women feel about my penis. I provided proof for my personal experience to back up my claim. It's not about a fucking dick."	0.0

3055	I disagree. The only deck I can see wanting Grimnir now is Dragon, because it can comfortably ramp to 10 and use it as an effective boardwipe.

3078	Usually when I hear this I'm slightly annoyed but don't really care all that much. My annoyance was much less slight though when I worked at a restaurant where the chef/owner pronounced it like that. I mean she had a very grating personality in general, so that definitely added to it. Still though, this is a recipe she wrote, and when the chipotle powder she uses for it runs out, she's the one who orders more, and when customers complain about it, she's the one they talk to, meaning that she has to have heard the correct pronunciation hundreds of times throughout the time she's had it on the menu but she just doesn't care.	0.0

Some common examples of this are marking a survey as open to everyone but requiring:  * which state they live in * male or female for gender * which way someone votes  It's okay to only want responses from a particular group of people (Americans, Males / Females, 18+); you just need to make sure that you are requesting those things in the demographic section of your survey title.   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."	0.0
3121	"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "	0.0

I have Mediacom. 100 mb down 20 mb up. 

There are only two (actually 3 isp's) here in the Desert. Two that matter (Mediacom and Verizon) the third is a local isp, but speeds are not their strong suit. 

I have the fastest consumer grade connection available. For 70 bucks, it's not bad. 

My ping issues are from having 3 roku's  in the house, which are always on, plus phones, laptops, tablets, etc... 

My pc is hard lined, everything else is wifi. Which, I turn off when my roommate is out. So the roku's, and everything aren't interfering whilst I play. 

But, Mediacom will not dual connect us, and Verizon does not connect on my side of town. So, I pay for everyone else to use my friggin Internet. Which sucks.

This sent the 8,500-lb. device crashing into the bomb bay doors, forcing them open and plummeting the bomb 15,000 feet below. Fortunately, the nuclear head for the bomb was in a separate location and the bomb was not armed. The bomb detonated on impact, leaving a 75-foot across, 35-foot-deep crater. It destroyed the home and property of the Gregg family of Mars Bluff, South Carolina. The family of six was injured but there was no reported fatalities.

That deck isn't that clunky, I'd argue. Math is hard and I'm a bit drunk so here's the simplified, perhaps mangled version. You've got 9 cards that are playable by turn 1 and 2 (no stampede, explosive trap, etc, just minions). Drawing 1 of them makes you happy as a hunter. By turn 1 you've got a 43% chance to draw at least 1 of those 9 cards. Excluding 2 drops, you've got a 37% chance to draw a playable 1 drop by turn 1.

Statistically you should've landed a curve pretty often. All you had to do with this deck was stall until you meme them out of the game. What went so wrong?"	0.0

Remember that even two perfectly equal teams will have one team lose, and one team win. Sometimes there's a crushing defeat. The other team probably isn't talking either.

3433	"Best Ninjutsu: Kaguya, I mean shes the goddess of chakra

Best Taijutsu: Guys 8 gates

Best Genjutsu: Itachis Tsukuyomi

Best Summoner: Jiraiya with his toads

Best Summon: When Sasuke summons that snake to save himself from Deidara, I don't remember the whole explanation but it saved his life so I'd say its a pretty important one.

Best Hokage/Kage: Hashirama by power but I really liked Minato, I thought his kunai teleportation stuff was really cool.

Best Teammate: Neji :(

Best Character Growth: This could go to so many people but I'm gonna avoid just giving it to the MC and say Gaara.

Best Shinobi: Kakashi, always willing to sacrifice for his village and friends, never afraid to fight to protect what he loves. Very wise and was given the task of trying to guide Sasuke and Naruto which was difficult given ones clan was slaughtered and the other was the nine tails jinchuuriki.

Best Kunoichi: Tsunade, very tough woman and the only female Hokage, one of the three legendary Sannin.

Best jutsu: Madaras Tengai Shinsei based on power, but I did really like Sasuke's rinnegan power in the Boruto movie(Amenotejikara )where he's able to teleport from one space to another in an instant.

Best Arc: Chunin Exams were alotta fun first time around. Either that or the Pain arc.

Best Villian: Tobi, very mysterious and powerful.  I remember being on the edge of my seat during his fight with Minato.  ""I could say I did it on a whim, or that I planned it, or that its war...or that its for peace"" - one of my favorite lines in the series.

Best Fight: This is so hard to choose.  My personal favorite was Kakashi vs Obito in the Kamui dimension.  Animation and emoitions were so high during the fight.  Itachi vs Sasuke is a close second, very tactical fight and a lot of fun to see unfold.

3457	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."	0.0

3465	"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."	0.0

3498	"Why study accounting if you are interested in technical stuff? Why not try engineering? Or Construction Management?

Anyways, I was going to school for economics and pre-law, and once I graduated I took up electrical work with my father and opted out of law school. Best thing that's ever happened to me, but it's hard work, sometimes working with scum people, but the pay is great, and the fact you can work with tools and big equipment all day is awesome. The only things I don't enjoy is being on-call, my hands hurting after work, and the fact that I never know what time I'm going to get home. We work in a very specialized field, so don't take my experience as the majority.

As an electrician, or any trade for that matter, you will never starve; as in no matter where you go, if you do good work there is always a larger demand for work than the supply of skilled electricians/plumbers/roofers etc. 

Don't let the white-collar people fool you...my dad paid for my sister and I's college by running an electrical contracting company. We make better money than a good amount of the office jockeys, but they will always say the contrary.


I would suggest going to school for Construction Management also, while working with a general contracting company doing every trade you can get your hands on. Or specialize in one thing like electric/hvac/plumbing and get out of school and get real work experience.

3508	"Watching MaM, I was very open to the possibility that he had a plausible explanation for the phone call that was not shown. I was well aware that I was not seeing his entire testimony. However, reading his full testimony, I was struck by the fact that he never actually gives an explanation: 

&gt;Q. Investigator Wiegert, did he give you the license plate number for Teresa Halbach when he called you?

&gt;A. I don't remember the entire content of our conversation but, obviously, he must have because I was asking the dispatcher to run the plate for me.

&gt;Q. Did you not trust that Investigator Wiegert got the number right?

&gt;A. I don't -- That's just the way I would have done it. I don't -- It's not a trust or distrust issue.

This is not actually an explanation. If he says at some point that he was verifying information about the case, I haven't been able to locate that statement. Later on redirect, Kratz assigns Colborn this explanation, which Colborn accepts:

&gt;Q. Mr. Strang asked whether or not it was common for you to check up on other agencies, or perhaps I'm -- I'm misphrasing that, but when you are assisting another agency, do you commonly verify information that's provided by another agency?

&gt;A. All the time. I'm just trying to get -- you know, a lot of times when you are driving a car, you can't stop and take notes, so I'm trying to get things in my head. And by calling the dispatch center and running that plate again, it got it in my head who that vehicle belonged to and what type of vehicle that plate is associated with.

He's not talking specifically about this case, he's giving a general explanation of scenarios in which he might call to verify a plate number. In the Halbach case, he'd clearly gotten enough information that he immediately went to follow up on a lead by interviewing Avery. I'm stumped as to how or why he'd have written down Teresa's license plate number separately from the other info about the case he'd have needed to question Steven Avery."	0.0

3540	"**Earthlock: Festival of Magic** is a chill RPG that's pretty breezy.

**Siralim &amp; Siralim 2** are monster capture games that you can pretty much play indefinitely. They're relaxing games that be focused on or played while winding down for the evening/netflix. The games aren't linked, so you can play either. Siralim 2 has a much more focused narrative and progression system. Siralim 1 is basically ""here are the mechanics, do whatever.""

**Stardew Valley** has been mentioned before, but this game is love. If you haven't played it you should at least check it out. It's similar to Harvest Moon/Rune Factory, though very much a western game.

**Bastion** was great fun and pretty chill. It's kinda action-y, but I didn't struggle with it despite having shitty reflexes. It also has a very soothing narration and ambiance.

**Shadowrun Returns (Original, Dragonfall, Hong Kong)** isn't a difficult game, and it's got an amazing cyberpunk atmosphere. The games are turn based and not particularly hard if you play them on the lower difficulties. The lose condition (you died) just means that you have to restart a mission, and none of your companions die permanently. 

**FEZ** is a charming platformer/puzzler that just oozes style. It's great fun and I definitely recommend it (though it's creator is a real dickhead).

**Decromancer** is a card battle game with an interesting world and a fun premise. The gameplay is really enjoyable if you're into card battles (more like strategic combat, really). No lose condition- failing a battle just means retreating and healing up.

**The Sims 3** is my favorite of the franchise, and you can pick up the expansions really cheap as they go on sale frequently. If you've never played it, I recommend it. You just sort  of dick around with your family of sims and play through a life simulator. None of the expansions are necessary, though I find Ambitions adds the most without changing the way the game plays.

**Mages of Mystralia** is an action-y little RPG where you play a fledgling mage learning her spells. There's a very fun spellcrafting system and the game hasn't been difficult. No scares, and deaths aren't terrible."	0.0
3541	"Mighty Guard is a must.

If you want to farm early ability points before you get to the final dungeon, Level 5 Death will also be very nice.

White Wind is useful.

But definitely make Mighty Guard a priority, it's easily one of the best spells in the game.

---

When I meant farming, here is a video of the spot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-l0R16u-YU

This is when you get to Castle Bal, a little after you get the Ranger class.  Most people like to max out Rangers because they provide the ability to attack 4 times (8 if dual wielding which I believe was a Ninja ability).  So freelancer with Dual Wield == massive damage (also pretty cheap, avoid this method.  It completely removes the fun out of some fights.)

Late game prior to Neo Exdeath in the final dungeon, you'll fight Movers.

Yeah, maybe that idea is a little fanfiction-esque, but it would certainly be a story with a unique twist on Mileena's character. 

I do think the idea of ""flipping"" the Mileena/Kitana rivalry is an interesting concept, i.e., Kitana being envious of Mileena while Mileena is enjoying success either in Earthrealm, or ruling Outworld, or whatever; while Kitana is stuck as a revenant in Netherrealm. A role reversal indeed."	0.0

3608	"I really don't want to sound like some red pill creep, but there *is* a lot of game-playing that happens when we meet potential future romantic partners. *Maybe* your friends are hotter (but, for real, probably not), but it's likely they're just better at sending all those signals that tell a person, ""yeah, I might wanna fuck.""

It's true that some of those signals involve appearance--think clothes and makeup--so there's a relationship between successful signal-sending and attractiveness, but not really *innate* attractiveness. I have enough friends of both genders to know that beauty isn't the same thing as flirting skills, and the latter is what gets people dates. 

I'm not trying to start a fight here; I'm rooting for you! As some stranger on the internet, I know I can't change the way that you feel about your appearance. Maybe I *can* help convince you that a different approach could be more successful.

Every time I criticize tool the only response I get is that one guy has a big drum set and that the songs are complicated to play. This does not make the music good or the fans less annoying. The best thing about metal is that part of it does not not take itself too seriously, it balances itself in a way. Tool takes itself way to seriously it is just a horribly mundane band with a cult like following.	2.0

Essentially up until the hiatus/before the reunion, blink's roots and background were always based out of San Diego. Always. But once Mark moved to L.A. it became a grey area, especially since Travis moved to L.A. not long after joining. But now enter Skiba (from Chicago) and exit Tom (the only member left who permanently resides in San Diego), that part of the band's history is definitely gone atm, regardless of the song.

For example, during the hiatus when social media was much less extensive, their MySpace page listed San Diego (I think it may have actually even said Poway) as their hometown, but now when you look at their Twitter it says Southern California, which is pretty much playing it safe. Makes reasonable sense. Either way, California is their identity as a whole."	0.0

I would use the Kappa crossovers since they are built for the frequency response of the speaker set. the factory curve might not line up well with the speakers. 

I would not waste money on replacing all those speakers if you are going to install a separate amp. music is recorded in 2 channel so the biggest bang will come from getting and installing a good set of component speakers in the front with that amplifier. You will not have the ability to adjust or tweak the center channel with a good DSP. and the rears are just playing what the fronts are doing which will muddy up the staging and imaging."	0.0

1. Hillary has been an advocate for women and children her entire life. After graduating at the top of her class, she went to work for the [Children's Defense Fund](http://www.childrensdefense.org/newsroom/cdf-in-the-news/press-releases/2013/honoring-hillary-clinton.html).
She also found a home-based education system in Israel, and made it happen in Arkansas. 26 states now use this program. [More] (http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/24/hillary-clinton-cites-israel-as-inspiration-for-home-based-education-programs/#)
She has very similar views as Bernie when it comes to Women's healthcare and occupational rights. But wouldn't you want someone making decisions about Women's health coming from an actual woman? [More about Hillary on Women's rights](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/womens-rights-and-opportunity/). 

2. I don't have a source to back this up, so I am open to rebuttal, but having a president as far left as Bernie will result in inevitable gridlock in congress. A Republican congressperson may be more open to one of Hillary's proposals rather than Bernie's. His supporters are driven by the thought of a political revolution, but you cannot revolutionize the political system through executive action. Hillary has a background of working with members of the opposite party to accomplish her goals. [Like the time when she was First-Lady, and she worked with Republican members of congress to create the Children's Health Insurance program, which is still in place today i think?](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/)

3. She was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign. A lot of people got really mad about that, but as a gay man, I see that as a big deal.

4. She is the only candidate that has really addressed the epidemic in our country that is Alzheimer's Disease. She has released a [plan](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/alzheimers-disease/) on her website about taking steps to finding a cure. *This reminds me of Obama's SOTU 2016 when he suggested that 2016 could be the year we curse cancer, and put Joe Biden in charge*

5. She is very similar to Obama. Those on the Republican side believe that a vote for Clinton is a vote for another 4 years of Obama. I believe that sounds great? Obama has his flaws but he is awesome? 

6. Yeah she fucked up with the emails. I can admit that. She fucked up pretty bad. But there is no way anything like that will happen again, *amirite?* she's probably learned her lesson.

7. I am actually an intern on her campaign, so i have had first-hand experience talking to her supporters. The people that I talk to are genuinely nice people. They acknowledge her faults, but chose to support her based on her best qualities like the ones I have listed above. They don't bash Bernie, but honestly believe that Hillary's policies are more realistic. When I look at Bernie's fan base, they tend to focus on Hillary's faults and embrace his strengths. But it has gotten out of hand. Young people are saying that Hillary could be worse than any republican (she's not.) Don't even get me started on the Sanders' circle jerk that is /r/politics. 


I am going to wrap this up now, because I am getting really tired of typing. But if you took anything out of this huge amount of text it would be this:

TL;DR Bernie is great and it's awesome that you support him, but my vision for America is different than yours, so I support Hillary. Can we please stop being dicks to her?"	0.0

3774	"Alcohol and marijuana are completely different for me. 

When I'm high, everything becomes trippy and I am more out of it. It's harder for me to complete tasks (ex. using a microwave, cooking etc). It feels like my motor skills/speed has decreased, but I usually am able to catch/throw things as good as I can sober. Even though I am more out of it, I am told I become chill as fuck and I can keep my cool (even though it doesn't feel that way lmao). There is also a burnout period with weed, making you have an overwhelming need to sleep. Driving home is not impossible but HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. This is good for chill outs with your friends, solo-sessions, self reflection, listening to music and movie watching (no complex movies because I usually lose interest quick). Weed hangovers are a thing, but they don't physically hurt. My head is a bit light headed, and usually I get moderately depressed. Can last up to 2 days depending on how much you had.

When I'm drunk, my surroundings get desensitized to my brain, if that makes any sense. My motor skills/speed/spacial awareness feel the same, but in reality they're in the shitter. I become very flirty when drunk. I say the truth a lot (sometimes too much), and if I get too drunk I become very loud and make an ass out of myself. Alcohol (depending on the person) has a period cal the ""dizzies"" where you feel like [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/a/ae/Hyperspace_falcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20130312014242) is happening to you. Driving home is impossible when smashed, seriously get a cab. This is good for bars, social events, and meeting new people (all in moderate amounts, because drinking too much is not good in any situation). Alcohol hangovers are a thing obviously, causing heavy headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, lightheadedness and regret.

When mixing the two, both the desensitization and trippy combine, fucking me up. It's almost impossible for me to do anything (ex. last time I mixed I watched myself spill a whole box of cereal on the ground and was too fucked to clean it up). I'm still flirty, but not loud. Do not drive home when doing this, you will not have a good time. My body (specifically my face and fingertips) get really fuzzy, almost a pins and needles feeling, but it feels really good. I recommend more weed than alcohol when mixing, cause imo it feels better and it reduces hangover the next day. The hangover is a combination of the two others, so it's not pleasant. Mixing is good for house parties, clubs and concerts.

3777	"Also, you are right that low working capital is better, but of course companies need some level of WC to operate. (Eg if you are a retailer you could reduce your WC by selling down all your stock, but what happens after that!)

Therefore what you are really concerned with is looking at trends in working capital and understanding whether there are ways to decrease working capital without affecting other things. If you decrease working capital by $5m, this is $5m of cash available immediately to the company, sometimes working capital management is the difference between success and bankruptcy.

-looking at days of sales or purchases in working capital balances helps understand the operating cycle of a business, again something you can't do with cash. Eg if a company has 10 days of sales in debtors, this means it takes 10 days to convert sales into cash. If creditors are payable in 5 days, this means you have to pay your expenses quicker than you collect cash. Overall this means you have 5 days of working capital that the company has to finance somehow. Looking at days sales or purchases rather than absolute values lets you compare trends even if the company has grown or declined significantly.

Those two men who died in NM in my opinion died in vain, because he removed the area from the ""official map"" after the fact.  He should have just left everything as is and said, let the chips fall where they may.  I for one do not have anymore faith in Forrest Fenn because he removed the Gorge off of the official map.  If I were you, cjonesmo, I would save your money and forget about the treasure hunt, because at this point it's not about whether you have the correct solve or not, it's about whether Fenn is going to cut more areas away from his map.  I look at that map as a contract, not to be altered in anyway.....and Fenn to me is not abiding by the spirit of that contract with us searchers.

3815	"Ugh this reminds me of the last and final time I house sat. I was watching my parents friends cat and since they had a pool and Wi-Fi (my parents didn't at the time) they let me stay at their house. It was very old, a very closed-off floor plan with tons of random doors and windows and a lot of hidden nooks. I never felt comfortable when I was there, but I just chalked it up to the house being old and creaky. 

One wednesday, after am unexpected half day, I get back to their house from work to feed the cat. Before doing anything else, I went to the bathroom. Even though I was there alone (or so I thought) I latched the hook lock. Im sitting there on the toilet and I watch the door get pushed gently to the extent that the hook would let it go, like someone was trying to very quietly see if they could get in. I told myself I was being stupid and that no one could be in there, I had locked all the doors every day. At the end of watching their house, I'm changing the bird feeder for the first time since I had been there and I noticed a door on the back porch that had been unlocked the whole time I was there. Every night I had slept there by myself, every time I heard noises and thought I was being stupid. The fucking house was wide open. "	0.0

It only takes one conversation to see how badly a person is TRYING to impress you, and I'm not of the type to TRY to impress anyone. That's pathetic.

I would say that people CHOSE to keep me around. I fucked up all my relationships with everybody during my 10 plus year drinking career. I gave everyone the chance to break it off cleanly, and I wouldn't have blamed them. If someone thought I had fucked up enough to the degree that they didn't want to associate with me, I never begged them, nor do I hold it against them.

They are all atheist except Kierkegaard but even he gives good advice about how to deal with anxiety when we realize the shit-storm of a world we live in. These philosophers try and teach what do in the face of the nihilistic meaningless world we live in, which when realized can really dampen ones mood. Hope this helps and good luck. Cheers	0.0

R2: Sloane 25D 8CL 15CP 15T 1G vs Hawks

Danger 37D 11CL 25CP 6T 1G vs North

R3: Sloane 31D 8CL 24CP 9T 1G vs Port

Danger 36D 9Cl 20CP 2T 3G vs Melbourne

Total:

Sloane 80D, 25CL, 52CP, 28T, 2G

Danger 97D, 25CL, 60CP, 17T, 7G

**Discussion:**

Dangerfield is on top for all listed stats other than equal in Clearances after 3 rounds. An arguement can however be made for the quality of opponents. Adelaide faced and beat fellow top 5 opponents in GWS and Port Adelaide, as well as the lowly Hawks. Geelong faced Freo (11th after 6 rounds), North (15th after 6 rounds), and Melbourne (8th after 6 rounds). Note that Geelong only narrowly won vs North.

Dangerfield has the stats, but has accumulated these stats in a team lacking midfield strength and facing lowly opponents. 

Sloane is only slightly behind in stats, and would be considered Elite for all, and has versed much tougher opponents. 

**Verdict:**

Both are good stop fighting.

The solution to this would not be pretty.

If you're talking about Haru as a person you might hang out with? Yeah, she's actually pretty cool.

In terms of writing, my biggest criticism is pacing. It's always been my contention that she should've been introduced as an NPC much earlier in the game so that we could get little snapshots of her personality or her opinions on current events.

Conversely, my biggest criticism of Makoto is that she gets a lot of the spotlight compared to other Thief characters.

It's honestly more sad than anything else.  How people can be so mis-informed is just beyond me.  I personally blame The Guardian and the sad lack of economics education in school.

I don't understand how someone can say something so flat-out wrong as:

&gt;f it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

And be taken seriously.  It's just amazing how little interest in reality this place has.

&gt;If it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

This is just wrong.  A flat out lie.  There is no evidence to suggest this and I don't know why you'd bother writing it out.

&gt;And it won't operate for ten years - solar is cheaper.

Solar and coal don't compete as solar is intermittent and requires large amounts of redundancy.  When solar is capable of running at all times we might be having a different conversation.

&gt;This is the economic reality.

No, it is not.  This is a lie to fit your priors.

&gt;Your whole act on this subreddit is pretending that you are the ""smart guy"" who ""faces the realities of economics"" (which by some bizarre coincidence always lines up with the Murdoch/Coalition party line) - so how can you justify promoting coal?

Because India lives in horrific poverty and coal allows them to rise out of it.  The 100% renewable study commissioned required India to be 1/7th as wealthy as us.  I'm not comfortable with consigning a sixth of the planet to abject poverty because they had the misfortune to develop after us.

Also yes, I do promote economic reality.  It should say something that I then line up with the LNP a whole heap more than the ALP.  Something about the ALP being a bunch of incompetent buffoons lying to the Australian people.

&gt;If we give a billion dollars to these scam artists we will never get it back.

Ok.  I'm not going to pay back my home loan.  That's how these things work lmao.

&gt; That's why the banks are refusing to back it.

They're refusing to back it because the federal ALP are refusing to back it.  This is known as sovereign risk.

&gt;Their economic modelling, no doubt dismissed by the likes of you as ""lefty nonsense"", shows that the mine will be a failure.

Then it will be a failure.  That's fine.  The infrastructure will not solely be used by Adani.

&gt;And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of any objections.

Reasonable objections have been met.  This is probably the most stringently regulated mine in the history of the world.

Every other objection requires it to be blocked through legislative fiat, which the party of free markets will not do.

You are an exception throught we need more people like you

I hate communities that do this kind of things, i can repair the quirk and even add or quit some things but you say is no use, that ""flower spam"" already has an stigma so it's going to be rejected even if it's good to go just because people hated the original... ok im done i'm not here for this shits thanks again man (or woman idk) but i'm done

Don't worry about ideas, i have several, i'm going to tell you something ""flower spam"" was the sixth on the list of possible quirks for this, i choose it because it was funny and really diferent to anything i see before, unique you can say, in a begining it was just that, spam flowers, useless right? but then i start thinking

¿Can flowers grow in any surface, or just in soil?

¿Can flowers grow in living beings? 

¿Another creation quirks use something to create things, they didn't appear from thin air, what does the flowers use? 

I like the idea, I began to plan things, start writing concepts, organizing my ideas, etc, four days later i was good to go and even then is incomplete

the other quirks i have planned we're rejected because 

a) they were to similar to other quirks, both from this page and from the series

b) they we're stupidly op

And since i write this another ideas came to my mind

Just three of the ideas i think off

Muscle presure: this quirk allows the user to put strain in their muscle compresing them allowing to use the 100% of the human muscle power or even increase it beyond the human limit, more than 100% 

Rejected because it was to similar to one for all, it's weakness even where that the strain the body goes after using the quirk break the users body

Golden form: the user can transform for several seconds into a special form that heavily increase the strength, agility, endurance, etc, and gives the power to fly, after it's use the user collapse from tireness

It is based on the súper saiyan yes, but I don't think it was that usefull, i wanted to create a quirk that can be use effectively in tandem alongside the users own capabilities, this was more like a ""last resort"" attack so no

Magnetization: the user can magnetize his body to atract metalic objects from his sourroundings to use them as weapon, armour etc, he needs to be carefull or otherwise the objective can travel to fast an knock him down with a powerfull blow

To boring

4143	"A small detail to add - there *is* such thing as ""too much speed"" when you're trying to decloak smaller ships, and I'd recommend not overloading your MWD when trying to decloak.

First, a few basics; then, an illustrated explanation:

 * Use the Centered Tracking camera setting to always get a reliable angle on their position when they decloak.

 * Always double-click in space instead of clicking the decloaked target and approaching, because once an object ""no longer exists"" in Eve (destroyed, cloaked, warped off-grid, etc.) your vector of movement gets messed up in most cases.

OK, so:

**1.** [Here you are in your Sabre](http://i.imgur.com/IGaCz0I.jpg), which has its own collision model. The covops also has its own collision model. Your goal is to get within 2000m (global decloak radius) from the *edge* of the pinata's collision model.

**2.** [You start burning at the guy (let's assume meh skills and a nano)](http://i.imgur.com/Btiso70.jpg). The covops will only decloak if *during a given tick* your collision model intersects with their model+decloak radius. In the case of this Sabre, there are two ticks during which you'll get a decloak, so that's good.

**3.** You might be tempted to overload your MWD so you can ohmygodgettohimbeforehegetsoutofmybubble. Thing is, [when you overload your MWD you are basically spreading apart your collision-per-tick spheres farther](http://i.imgur.com/feMKByN.jpg). In this example it doesn't look so bad, because you had a really good vector in the first place. 

**4.** But yeah, don't do that. Why? Well, say that your trajectory is a little bit off. [In fact, here's the closest possible edge case](http://i.imgur.com/jnRRFwa.jpg). Basically you can see that you are actually passing too quickly through the sphere formed by the covops's modelRadius+2000m. For comparison, [here's the exact same vector without your prop overloaded](http://i.imgur.com/0vO9PBL.jpg). The more you increase speed beyond a reasonable number, the more you start counterproductively decreasing your allowable margin of error for your approach vector. Going too fast might even mean drifting out of heated scram range despite getting a successful decloak.

**5.** It seems like a really pedantic point to make when you consider the range of speed of Interdictors, I'll admit. If you need some training wheels for a bit, just drop a second bubble along the way. But keep in mind that it becomes *really* important when you're in something like a fleet ceptor, though, since those are so fast and their model sizes are too small.

**Summary:** You want the ""right"" speed for decloaking, not the ""highest speed"": decloaking is tick-based and &gt;3km/s~ you might actually start fucking yourself over. Fleet interceptors may want to attempt to decloak at below max speed.

4164	"Yes.  Yes there is.  There are, in fact, several better teams you can put together.  Your 120 cost is still going to slow things down until you rank up, but we'll work with what we can.  

1.  Devil team.  You have 2 red sonias, therefore you have a devil team.  Sonia / Sonia / Vampire / [King Baddie](http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=688) / Zuoh / Lilith or Lucifer // friend Beelzebub is a great devil team.  Now, it's way too expensive, so you'd need to rank up a lot.  Tone it down a bit and use Sonia / Vampire / King Baddie /  Big Baddie / Lilith // friend Beelzebub for a 103 cost version that'll get you started.  

2.  Urd is a great fire team leader.  Urd / Cao Cao / Ares / Yamato Takeru / Chiyome is a solid fire TPA team.  100 cost in the current forms you have, so you can run that, too.  Evolve your monsters as your cost increases and you can afford to - Urd first.  

3.  Bastet.  You have a great Bastet setup: Bastet / Vishnu / Meimei / 2 from [Susano (for shield) / Freyja (damage boost) / Meimei2 (more boards) / Vishnu2 (more TPAs).  Pair with Verdandi or Awoken Bastet.  This is actually an endgame-potential team, once you level up, evolve, and awaken everything.  The current iteration is right around 100 cost, depending on which flex subs you take, so it's also affordable.  

4.  Freyja.  She's got a new buddy in Sylvie, so if you can find a Sylvie friend and run them together, she's very powerful.  I'd go Freyja / Michael / Meimei / Bastet / Vishnu // Sylvie friend.  Also affordable for you.  

5.  If you can evolve your DMeta, you can run DMeta / Satsuki / Persephone / Lucifer / dark flex (whatever you can afford, this will be hard given ult DMeta is 70 by herself).  Ultimate Dark Metatron is extremely powerful, so this would be a ""something to work towards"" team.  

Try out those teams, get a feel for them, and see what you end up enjoying most.  It's good to work on a few teams, since sometimes one breezes through where another gets stopped, but you really have a lot to work with.  "	0.0

Massage the oil gently into your skin, then rinse away. If you are using straight oils you may need to use a damp washcloth to get rid of residue. If you're using a commercial oil cleansing product it probably has emulsifiers in it so the reside will rinse away.

Back in the 90s I was an associate working at our local department store, in Housewares, Toys and Sports. Russ Trolls were all the rage for some reason, and we had both TV and print ads selling these ugly things for $14.99. We also had a cheaper and larger version by another company for $12.99.

This male customer got into an argument with the department manager because he SWORE the Russ Trolls were $12.99, and he DEMANDED he be sold one at $12.99. Soon into the argument his wife stormed over to the manager and claimed she saw the TV ad showing the Russ Trolls at $12.99 (nope, we had a copy of the ads in the office).

They got so loud and obnoxious that soon there were what had to have been nearly 20 adults, ALL yelling and demanding the Russ Trolls for $12.99. They actually ran down the doll aisle to grab them before we had the head of security finally restore some semblance of order and told the crowd that he would take their names and phone numbers and give them a call once everything was ""sorted out"". 

He offered to show them our copy of the ad (both TV and print) and a person yelled ""I don't NEED to see that! I KNOW what I saw!"".

4276	How exactly is this an insane finish? When the sum total of the numbers of viewers and followers of Last Week Tonight alone more than double those of InfoWars, it would seem apparent that Oliver would have just as much sway in the realm of politics as Jones in terms of the average American. It is one thing to shine the light on a news organization founded on conspiracy and outright falsehoods. But he acts as though this fringe element is more dangerous to the general populace despite the fact that Jones clearly presents himself as the head of a media element with a very open agenda. Oliver presents his show as having researched findings (dozens of which distort the truth or fail to tackle an issue from more than one perspective) while peppering these segments with personal attacks and fabrications of his own. This tactic, which can be seen coming from Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, and the like, leads to days of media coverage from official news organizations who extol these programs as though they contain an ounce of journalistic integrity. These same comedians will then boast and proudly declare themselves a line of defense against fake news when they seek to bolster a particular world view, regardless of facts. However, when such criticisms are directed their way, comedians like Oliver will simply claim to be pure entertainers, knowing full well the effects of their shows on the political sphere. The same arguments would hold even if his attacks were directed at CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.	0.0

1) Try using a larger/longer wiper blade on the upper wiper arm, so that it wipes the area directly in front of the camera lens.  Depending on how the windshield molding is shaped, you might excessively bend the upper inch or two of wiper blade, so you'll hae to replace it more frequently.

2) Move your camera lens over to the right a couple of inches.

I don't believe it would hold any grounds in the case of a CD as you need to give them your home address to get one in the first place.  That is, unless you use a fake ID, but that could result in you getting charged with fraud.

Make sure to get junk mail or some shit sent their as well, but the paper stuff you're thinking about ordering is generally the safest to order especially if domestic and from a trusted vendor so you'll most likely be fine regardless of decision.  It's just a matter of respect.

*****
&gt; &amp;quot;Yesterday&amp;#039;s illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people,&amp;quot; said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement announcing the latest sanctions on the Latin American country.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s decision to sanction Maduro is not as severe as broader economic sanctions on Venezuela&amp;#039;s oil industry.

&gt; Last week, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 government and military officials tied to Maduro.

4326	"I began a long affair with a girl that was married. We had a ton of moments but I'll recount just a few for you.

We'd always hook up while her husband was at work, being that he neither had his drivers license or could even drive at all, there was no chance of him walking in on us. So one day I show up for a romp and we get down and dirty, and after we finish I casually ask ""hey do you have a towel or something i can use to clean up?"" and she tosses me some cloth and I wipe myself off. It wasn't until after that i realized she had given me her husbands pajama pants and i wiped our sexjuices off on his pants.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."	0.0

4332	"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."	0.0

There are 2 theories: I was the last one hired and they didn't realize how many 14 year olds would quit in week 1 or 2- Chuck really was the creepy pedophile everyone thought he was and I was a guy. The place almost exclusively hired girls and every guy was eventually fired for very strange reasons. For instance, my friend was fired for ""sweeping the floor wrong"", whatever that's supposed to mean. Never did find out which it was. Creepydude died 15 ish years ago I heard. He and his wife didn't live in town, they lived in an rv and only came to town in the summer. That was the reason given for the bed in the basement, but it conveniently gave ol' Chuck ample material for ""jokes"" to the 14 year old girls.

The summer between 8th and 9th grade I started dating my SO and he gently encouraged me to start eating more regularly. It hurt so much to eat more than one meal a day and it made me nauseous. I felt like I just couldn't fit more than one meal a day in me.

I'm now ending my freshman year of college and I'm within an average weight range for my height and age. I still don't eat a lot, maybe one meal and a few snacks throughout the day.

I have heard of nonsexual power exchange, especially from married couples where one person is kinky and the other is not, and no one is comfortable quite yet with their significant other having a sexual relationship with another. The ironic part is that D/s and power exchange is so intimate even without sex. 

It does seem common for straight Dommes to be into chastity. Whether that's a straight female thing or not is beyond my wisdom though. ha. I'm not male but I'm with you. A sexless relationship is -not- what I want and I would end a relationship that turned out to be sexless.

There's not a single valid reason you can come up with to do 2MB before SW. But since you already buried your head in the sand earlier you put yourself in a position where you'd lose face if you don't get your demands met.

You've been given plenty of opportunity to get your head out of your ass without much loss of face.

The mere fact that you think there's even a possibility of setting demands and making compromises displays the degree of misunderstanding you have. This is science at work not some miss America competition."	0.0

4378	"Delita is evil. He is the monster that he sought to destroy and while he is perhaps sympathetic, he murders or betrays everyone in his quest for power. Ovelia tries to give him his just rewards but unfortunately fails.

You have a very....generous interpretation of events. I haven't played either version since the WotL release on PSP, but I've played this game a dozen times so I'm gonna try and poke at them.

&gt;Delita then uncovers a traitorous councilor to Goltanna and executes him, earning Goltanna's favor. 

My impression is that the councilor was a fall guy for Delita's actions, who actually was the spy. It's possible he was another spy, but likely Delita simply framed him for the Hokuto plot and murdered him to get him out of the way and gain Goltana's trust. The only evidence is a witness that Delita himself provides, and he kills him before any objections can be made.


&gt; Delita successfully kills Goltanna, but instead of killing Orlandeau, Delita kills a lookalike and lets the real TG Cid go with Ramza in his search for the church's true goal. Delita then assumes Goltanna's position as head of the Southern Sky.

I've seen the idea that Delita let Orlandu go, but this is highly unlikey. The stand-in that Delita kills is a member of the Glabados church provided for the purpose of framing Orlandu for Goltana's murder (this is explicit in the japanese version that he's a member of the church). There's no reason to let Orlandu go except to betray the Templar knights (of which Delita is a member), and there's no way the church would provide a stand-in to help betray themselves. Further, Orlandu walks away with one of the Auracites when Ramza busts him out of jail. Considering the Templars gave him that stone, they had to have known that Orlandu escaped with it and Delita killed a stand-in or else they would have come looking for their stone to give to someone else to use.


&gt; At the same time, Valmafra, learning of Delita's betrayal as he speaks to Orran, struggles to carry out her orders to kill Delita. Delita senses her hesitation, and taunts her to kill him. Instead, Valmafra abandons her orders and serves Delita.

Does she? Or does he just capture her until after he becomes king?

&gt; Finally, Orran tries to uncover the church's plot and is burned at the stake as a heretic; it is unknown what power Delita had to stop this event.

The power of being the most powerful man in the country. If Delita didn't want Orran to die, he wouldn't have let Orran die.

&gt;  Delita spared Ramza several times, as well as spared Orlandeau

The second is questionable at best. The first is just not true. Delita never tries to fight Ramza, and given that he relies on Ramza to slay the Lucavi instead of trying to do so himself, it's unlikely he would have emerged triumphant. He probably also knew this having grown up with him, and hence never tried. Besides, as you point out, Ramza was needed for that whole Lucavi problem.

Delita MEANS well, but he becomes a black-hearted fiend at the end. Ovelia recognized it. Everyone else should as well."	0.0

4498	"&gt; 1. Is a dual cam worth it?

Yes, depending upon what you want to do with it.

So there are two types of dash cameras in this generation with parking mode. 1) With excellent parking modes, but only good-fair video quality; 2) With Excellent video quality, but lackluster parking mode.

Excellent parking mode is: Automatically enable/disable (lackluster is very painful in this department), Buffered recording (able to record a few seconds before, and after action detected), low power when in use (only writes to micro SD card when motion activated detected), voltage cut off feature (to protect battery.)

&gt; 2. Is having a parking mode feature worth it?

So is it worth it, well dual cameras definitely [improve parking mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGWGX1t8DU0). Do you back into the spot 100% of the time? Most don't. Even if you do, [you can be hit from behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhIXOxjyko).

Hardwiring is a little more difficult, I actually like GPS (speed/location only not directions), built in Wifi definitely improves your ability to check video, change settings, over a LCD screen. Some of the Parking mode dash cams have Cloud feature (stream anywhere - paid feature) and cellphone notifications of G sensor activation(s) while in park mode (generally free feature.) Some have excellent night mode, like the Thinkware F770 2 CH. 


Others are simply vehicle on dash cams, like the A119 - Excellent video quality day, good night, good shadow, lackluster park mode. You can hardwire this to hide wires, but most hardwire to an outlet that is only powered when the ignition is on.

----

I would say Excellent Park mode worth it, dual cam worth it, wifi worth it, GPS worth it, and being discreet is definately worth it.

Just like the P.T. easter egg in TPP, I wouldn't mind that at all. If they used Low Roar's new song *13*, it would be awesome. It's an instrumental, could be eerie in the right context. 

&gt;And yes I'd love if they write music for the game. Honestly it's kinda creepy but it almost seems like they wrote the music to fit the trailers. I know that's not possible but they work so well together.

It has absolutely nothing to do with being ""small-minded"" but simply with them adhering to their ecclesiology. Just because someone really was a good person or even a great Christian doesn't mean that we *ought* to formally commemorate them as a saint of the church. It's true that C. S. Lewis is a greatly admired figure among many Catholics today but it still doesn't change the fact that they were never in communion with him, *and how could any church presume to commemorate someone they didn't know in the Eucharistic body?*   This doesn't mean that private veneration of saints outside the Church or even saints that haven't been officially commemorated can't occur, and I actually do know a handful of people, including myself, that venerate saints outside of our respective communions. But the public, corporate veneration of saints in our official calendars is a completely different story, and the current state of some of our Anglican Calendars is laughable. "	1.0

4568	"Firstly, I am sorry you have to go through such things. Alone each one is hard to deal with, so having a combination of issues is always much harder to get under control. As far as telling them goes.... Do you feel it would have a positive or negative impact on your life and/or mental health help? I personally feel it's always best to inform anyone you have daily interactions with, such as close family members, significant others, and closest friends. I feel this way because it helps them to better understand you, your actions and reactions to situations, and how to help when there's noticable behavior changes. It gives you a chance to build a support group within loved ones. If they are like my family was, which it sounds as though they are, maybe having pamphlets or literature for them to read that is science based to read themselves, as you break the news to them. Ignorance of a certain mental health condition can have a huge impact on how the conversation will go and how they accept what you have and deal with on a daily basis. Generalized opinions of conditions are worse to ""break through"" than if someone just doesn't know what it is at all. I attempted telling my aunt about my ocd paraphrasing studies and research mixing in my opinion and personal struggles. It went horribly. She was not only confused but overwhelmed and it caused her to basically shut down on me. So, when I brought the issues to my mother and step dad about a month later, I had gathered pamphlets and even printed out short articles and explanations of said disorder from medical sites. I had in depth breakdowns for later reads for them once they grasped the basic concepts. This method was very successful and after a few days, once she accepted I had mental issues and I assume replayed my life and now understood so many things I'd done growing up that she hadn't previously, she came to me with questions and the door was open for discussion and understanding. So, literature always helps unknowing parties grasp the basics and may allow for deeper insight. Another thing to consider is, do you feel you could better approach them once you have seen a professional and gained more knowledge yourself? Would being treated first benefit you more, via therapy or meds or both, in how you handle Thier reactions to the info drop? Each person is different in what approach is best for them, as well as each family in accepting said info and how they respond to it. Majority of Parents know when something is wrong or not right with Thier children, so it may go a lot better than one may think. Then again, parents also tend to see and not believe because its hard to fathom you have a child with mental health problems. Often you see the parent feeling it's Thier fault, they did xx or xx wrong and caused it, or some sort of outside factor causing it. That's why it's important to provide short to the point medical and science based info for them to read. Sorry for the jumble mumble and it not being well organized or written. Super tired but wanted to offer my 2 cents and tiny bit of how I went about it personally with my family. Just remember to not overwhelm yourself or your ocd will get worse. Also, have a plan of action in place with lots of info ready and list key talking points. Short n Sweet, until they are ready to dive deep with you. Best wishes and luck to you!!! Lmk how it goes for you in whatever you decide. "	0.0

4594	"I see this issue, as I do many social issues, as three separate questions:   1. Firstly, it is a legal issue. I support legalization. Whatever your position in the morality of cannabis or any other substance for that matter, the questions ""should you use it"" and ""should the government try to stop you from using it"" are far too often conflated.   2. Second, it is a moral issue. You are right that there is no specific prohibition on this according to the bible, at least as far as I am aware. Therefore, it is up to everyone's own personal feelings, and people of the same religion may make different choices. As long as it does not control your life, that is.   3. Thirdly, it is a health issue. In some cases cannabis can actually be used to ease the pain of highly uncomfortable conditions. Drugs, in general, are of course bad for you (though not even as bad as alcohol) and so I steer away from it personally for this reason. "	0.0

4598	Just treat her like a ridiculous overgrown child and never expect anything different from her. Give her simple, clear directions and never any real responsibility (no babysitting) and then don't get too surprised or upset if she fails or messes up something. Only tell her things you don't mind everyone else knowing, and smile and nod and correct her like you would a child who is learning the ropes socially. Try to engage her but also keep her at arms length - she will be in your life forever, so how you react to her will determine how unhappy this fact makes you. If you treat her like an adult toddler who just can't help being sort of obnoxious and overbearing and over excited and gently but firmly correct her every time or just walk away then it won't really get your goat so badly.  It's when you put the expectation of a fully grown adult person on her that you'll be disappointed. Just remember always that she's kind of a loud social ditz and treat accordingly 	1.0

Colborn wrote his report the day after Avery got out because he knew the person from Brown county could expose him anytime if he had written down notes on his end.   MCSD was so screwed if nothing had gotten in the way of that lawsuit. Do you really think Steven Avery is the only person who got unfair treatment? Every person those officers and Vogel help arrest or convict were about to have serious grounds to have their cases  looked at. That's not even bringing potential financial ruin into the equation.

They've often told us that they missed certain, very specific, things, like ""a chili dog from Big Jim's convenience store"" or ""a milkshake from Cook Out"".

4633	Permits are required for groups over 25. For a small group &amp; quick ceremony, you should be fine without a permit.  [Toronto Parks](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=bc2adada600f0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)  [Wedding photography](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=7a841d94f4301410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bc2adada600f0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) however, I think, always requires a permit... Though small group, quick photos, not expecting people to get out of your way... Should be fine.  Now, as for which Parks, I'm fairly well versed in East-End parks &amp; can give some tips if you have questions on specific parks. Glen Stewart, like a lot of Toronto green space, is a ravine. Specifically, it's a lovely series of walking paths through a heavily forrested ravine.   There's not a lot of space for you to have a ceremony that wouldn't be in a walking path &amp; if the weather's nice, it will be a trafficked, though not crazy busy, path.  Now, the ravine aspect. The spring means a lot of the ravine green spaces are quite wet. While this could make them less trafficked, there is a reason.  I'll think on it &amp; see if I can come up with a good suggestion. In the meantime​, I would suggest browsing the city's park website, it is a good resource. If you think you find a good match, I'd be happy to answer any questions.  &amp; Also, congratulations!	0.0

4739	"Actually, dogs are not obligate carnivores. They have a mutation (a similar one is found in humans) that lets them digest grains better than their wild relatives. So some vegetables and grains isn't a bad addition to their diet, though I would still recommend  a dogfood low in grains and with meat as the first ingrediant. And even then their teeth, digestive system and nutritional needs are suited for a diet high in meat. They can live on a vegan diet, with the right supplements, but it's not at all what their body is suited for.
Cats absolutely are obligate carnivores, they can not digest plants very well. Even the best vegan catfood is as unnatural and unhealthy for them as a diet of solely meat would be for a rabbit or cow.

As for the stuff the petfood is made of, that depends on what  kind you buy. Some is  as you put it ""bread nuggets"" and made from animals too sick to be legally sold to humans. Some is actually made from decent ingredients. Though for cat food, the unwanted chicks from chicken hatcheries is, if handled properly, probably better and more natural for them than fish based foods, considering cats wild relatives are desert dwelling predators.

Using the bargain-brand crappy petfoods as an example to justify feeding a cat or dog vegan petfood is as unfair as someone using vegan potato chips as  an example to justify never feeding a child fruits or vegetables of any kind. Even with the proper supplements, a diet without any fruits or vegetables isn't natural for humans. (Even the Maasai people, who are famous for living mostly on milk and blood from their cows, do eat  some grains, legumes, and vegetables) And even with the proper supplements, a vegan diet is far from natural for dogs and cats, even if it is an improvement over the garbage sold under some pet food brands.
