1	dkztc5x	dkztrvd	AskReddit	I guess I'm a little different there but I totally understand it. I can definitely spend longer periods by myself, but if I'm in the house for more than a couple days I get really antsy and then need to go outside. If there is any sort of big outdoor project I've got going on, I can definitely stay on my property alone as long as I can be active outside.  	I'll go outside in the backyard often, unless it's winter, and just hang out with my dogs. And I enjoy going out and doing things, going to the library, the coffee shop near my house, the farmers market, or even the mall, but I can be perfectly content just being at the house.  Dealing with people can be exhausting, especially when it's ride or stupid people haha.	Not
2	dgz1102	dgz2dso	EliteDangerous	Small ships only sounds shit. And the amount of time in between each date is huge. 2 days to travel 500 light years? That's doable in 15 minutes.	The goal behind having small ships only is twofold: 1 is a very affordable expedition so many new players can easily join in, and 2 is to provide an interesting alternative to the traditional "aspaconda" expeditions. It gives a challenge to people to try and engineer their ass off with the small ships. It was a huge success last year (we had over 300 people register when we were expecting 50), and was a real blast. Sometimes quite literally.	Not

5	dkzpr1z	dkzsdzm	Android	You might want to give a bit more info than that? What specifically didn't you like about the OP5 reviews?	The complaints that turned me off the most were with OnePlus not the phone itself. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with. In addition, the customer support is shotty, but that can be anecdotal although it still does worry me. The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much.   All in all, I am just trying to shop around for comparable phones and was wondering if there was something similar or more powerful than the OP5 whether the price is higher or not.	Not

I used a turtle/turtle build suggested by FawksB. One deck was a knight with buff and heal cards, the otger was paladin with an attack card, Lillith and two support cards (I think). The key to the build is Lillith. It's the bio card and and it's your main source of damage. Be warned that this build takes a long time but it's safe.	Not

37	dgycgre	dgys7fk	Bestbuy	Am I the only one who thinks these accommodations are BS? Like, last year, you just printed off a coupon and only once they were all used (or mostly used, I suspect) was the coupon pulled. Now they put up X (1,000 in this instance, apparently) coupons via the Learning Network, and once those are "claimed" the offer is gone. And yet, 800 of those people may never use the coupon.   Last years Samsung Accom lasted for like *four or five months*. This one lasted for like four or five *hours* (well... ten hours, but still). \*facepalm\*	Yes it is bs because with only 1,000 coupons and 1,026 stores there are entire stores that didn't get even one. I thought that the point of the accommodations program was to allow employees to have better knowledge of and experience with the products that they sell. So how are we going to get that real world knowledge when only 0.8% of all the employees nationwide have a shot at a coupon?	Not
38	czba7se	czj6ui0	MakingaMurderer	The problem with this theory is the profile and psychology behind Steven Avery. Killers fall into two main categories (which of course are broken down further but these are the two main differences) of organized and disorganized. This theory has SA organized one moment, and disorganized the next and switches his profile several times.   SA is a man with an IQ in the 70's, highly disorganized as seen in his home and workplace, and has never shown any of the planning and awareness of an organized killer.   This theory has him cleaning the gun and placing it back into it's original place,  cleaning up blood, DNA and other forensic evidence, using plastic sheeting, removing his fingerprints, being in full control in a kidnapping and he is able to fully burn a human body knowing exactly how long and what type of fire he needs. This shows SA as organized and intelligent.   However at other times during this theory we have him bleeding all over her car and not worrying about it which shows he also wasn't wearing gloves, he decides to place the body and car on his own property even after having her in another remote off-site location, he throws keys and a license plate in a random place instead of disposing of them properly, and he leaves her spare key on the bedroom floor of his trailer.   To make this theory fit, you have to change SA's way of thinking and personality as well as his intelligence and skill level. It just isn't plausible that at one moment he is cleaning a crime scene and the murder weapon, and the next he leaves a body in the backyard and leaves blood all over her vehicle.   And before the arguments of who knows why killers do the things they do, or that killers are dumb and make mistakes, I do agree with this. However profiling and criminal psychology are powerful tools in investigating and forensics, and this theory just doesn't fit SA's profile.   Also I didn't see where this theory explained the spare key on the bedroom floor or the fact that her body could not have been burned in the fire-pit. Even if you believe it was, it doesn't fit with much of the theme of an organized killer or a killer who would move her bones, as no killer would move the bones to a more obvious and persecuting location.   Tl;DR - Steven Avery can not be Dexter Morgan one minute, and a bumbling idiot the next.   Edit: I also want to add using his past crimes to build a profile to debunk this theory. In none of his other crimes he was convicted of (ignoring the rape for obvious reasons) he never tried to destroy or hide evidence, nor was he able to hide and food law enforcement. He never showed this sort of planning and intelligence that would be required for this theory to work. If SA did murder someone, it would be very sloppy and very obvious what he had done, and he would not be able to go for so long without slipping up and either admitting his guilt or saying something that led to his guilt. 	He may have been disorganized but tried to cover his tracks as best he could. Which is to say he left a lot of incriminating evidence. Especially, the body remains just outside his house.	Not

Of course, not every genderfluid person has the same experience as I do, but I don't feel the need to strictly label myself "man" or "woman". Another thing worth noting is I do put my sex as "female" on paperwork, surveys, etc (also use female pronouns).

Are we really getting out?  **Mal:** We are.  **Zoe:** Thank God.  **Mal:** God? Whose color is he flying?  I really feel like this is immense character development for Mal and should never have been cut. Throughout the series they never really explain why he is against religion, and I feel like this one little clip is an extremely powerful way to justify him.  That being said, seeing that clip after watching the entire series made it a lot more powerful. I think they should've included it somewhere in the middle of the series after they've established Mal's distaste for religion.		Not

They said they didn't know what the word meant, and I believed them - a lot of kids that age parrot what they hear without understanding the meaning.  So, not wanting to ruin the kids's day, I talked to them about not using words we're unsure about, and had him sit out of the first two activities. No biggie, problem solved.  We're having fun with the class when the principal walks up.  The principal had been talking with the kid, and asked me why the kid was sitting out.  I explained the situation, but the principal still didn't understand what the problem was.  The principal thought dildo was referring to an armadillo.  Yup, I awkwardly explained what a dildo was to my principal.	My mother-in-law was a teacher for a lot of years. She had a principal that didn't know what a condom was.

What you're thinking about only comes with bbq, sous vide, and braising. The 2nd reheat would slightly warm the inside, but not to the degree that it would break down the connective tissues you'd want.  All in all, this is a waste of food and time.	Not

I admit it's a change of pace from DS3, but I had a thousand hours in SotS before DS3 came out, so I'm up for whatever.   Assuming you meant, "do you really want a real opponent" and not "do you really know what you're doing."	actually i meant both and also "I don't really care about winning"  anyways if you want a tougher opponent just make a sl150 character and streamsnipe a good twitch streamer when they're in the arena	Not

You're not arguing on the grounds she's established, and your point is completely irrelevant. Breaking Bad had more viewership than esports, should it be in the x-games?   viewership doesn't define what should be in the x-games. I personally like e-sports in it, think its fine, and think everyone knows the difference between an esports medal and a snowboarding one, but I think you're argument is on the wrong grounds here.

Miami would also be good because you can drive up SC before their primary after Nevada and still help with Florida canvassing after SC.  I would say move on to California from Nevada if you have time, however, California is a late primary state and there may not be much campaign infrastructure here yet.	Not

116	dkzplfa	dkzpp8v	SquaredCircle	Man maybe it's just me but I am just not a fan of Aliester Black. The 2edgy4me Shadow The Hedgehog character is just kind of lame to me. Plus his finisher is pretty underwhelming and I think it was originally Rich Swann's? Anyway, all the stuff that gets him good reactions in NXT I just can't see the larger stage audience caring that much.	To be fair, that's not a character per se. He has had an interesting life.	Not
117	dkzitvz	dkzr5he	Drama	There is absolutely no evidence that Brown lay dieing in the street while the officer waited. In fact,  he was shot in the chest and twice in the head.  Evidence supports he was shot dead. What does BLM koolaid taste like?  >One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.  The paramedics were actually on the scene within a reasonable time.  This  also while a unruly crowd began sweeping the scene,  they had to bring in more than 10 units just to control them,  and a swat team.   The largest complaint about the body in the street is that locals complained the body itself was there too long while detectives rushed from other jobs to clear the scene and collect evidence,  all of this as I said with the beginnings of the riot happening.     Edit: i just realized you don't want to talk about something that conflicts with your argument.  Lol nevermind	what you don;t realize I have never brought that up. We're talking about one thing, and you bring up something unrelated. We're talking about the kid who died because of meth, and here you are typing paragraphs about Brown?  Wut?	Not

125	dkzwv4r	dkzyjln	DCcomics	When talking about what each character brings to the story, he said Starfire is Sci-Fi (or Sapphire in this article, whatever that means), Raven is horror, Damian is Detective stories, and Beast Boy is comedy. He's said this multiple times, and again, anyone who thinks that comedy is all Beast Boy brings to the table does not get the character.	I think the person didn't realize he said sci-fi and typed sapphire, which is honestly hilarious. I also agree on the Beast Boy thing. In the NTT, Beast Boy was a tragic character who hid behind jokes to battle his depression. All he is now is this comic relief.	Not

133	dkztkvn	dkzxlhk	PS4	Can you expand on this please?	(Not /u/trickdaemon, but I've played the game...)  Aiming and movement were both done on the same joystick. I actually prefer it, since the grappling hook is how you do most of your movement anyway, but people whined, as they're wot to do. So now there's a dual-stick option.

That can be a major help in getting guys to stick during the ups and downs of the season.	Exactly... plus these are kids that make lives in college. Freshman year is when you build that foundation of friends you're going to have in college (I mean kids you meet a few months in, not those first 10 weirdos you happen to meet -- I still love those weirdos btw) and perhaps forever. It's hard to just transfer to a different school, I feel like you have to feel super neglected on the field *and* have a bad college life to decide to leave.	Not

I actually make more in salary than they do and have ten years experience, but for whatever reason my family considers this a waste of potential and that I'm a dead beat because of it. I work seasonally on an island as a sous chef and co-run a successful food truck/waitress at a high end restaurant in the off season. I have a life I can afford and travel with, a great social life and I want for nothing.  I'm happy and don't consider that a waste.

149		dkzsrrp	Smite		Early game: khepri has better clear and lane pressure, along with a stronger level 1-4. Get suffers in the early game due to lack of clear and pressure, since the shield is garbage early. If you are looking for a snowball duo lane then pick khepri over geb.   Mid game: khepri's mitigation becomes very useful, and his pull can guarantee a kill. Geb shield starts to come online and can provide better peel    Late game: here is where the 2 gods separate in role. Geb has a much better initiation and can set up team fights and picks more easily than khep. Khepri is better at extending team fights because of his ult and can provide better late game peel from the root/pull, where as geb can guarantee more survivability.   Conclusion: both gods are top tier supports. They both provide different things to a team comp and can be picked on preference. I think it is very ignorant for you to say that khepri is bad since he has one of the biggest pick ban rates in the spl and can change a team fight in many ways. If you are looking to snowball out of the duo lane pick khepri. If you want to farm until late game pick geb. They both do their role well, and because of that u can't say that khepri is bad. Kuzembo is a bad support because he lacks everything. Sure u can say that one is bad compared to the other but that doesn't make him unpickable which is what u seem to be saying. 	Not
