Because I know IS is a lot more generous and care more for their game than the other gacha I play, there is no way they would not do a rerun in the next couple of months. I'm just glad they've delayed it as I would prefer not to face more filth emblems in my attempts to get to tier 20. Lord have mercy.

And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language.  But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say.  

I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn.  Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness.  I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about.  Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style.  

But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream.  

I've never met someone that could.  And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to.  It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about.  I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt.

33		czjfsbl	AsianParentStories		"I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. 4 years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying 4 yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want.

 Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. 

It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this. "	Not

47		czja1wt	Fantasy		"I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes:
 I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well.  It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. 
I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes.
And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than 4 star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. 

Current top series:

* **Way of Kings/Words of Radiance**: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)
* **Song of Ice and Fire:** Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change. 
* **LOTR** Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling,  it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is *fantasy* with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.
* **Riyria Revelations**: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.
* **Dresden Files** I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role. 
* **Hard Magic Series**: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.
* **Ready Player One**:Just a fun read. The 80's were fun.
* **Enders Game**: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.
* **Wheel of Time series**: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.
* **Hitchhikers Guide series**: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.
* **Asimov's Foundation Series** More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.
* **Dragon Riders of Pern**:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?
* **Harry Potter**: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.
* **Artemis Fowl series**: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. 

Books I like:

* **Mistborn**: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.
* **Same for everything else written by Butcher**: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.
* **Legend of Drizzt**: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **Iron Druid series** I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **The Shadow of What was Lost** : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book.

Do not like: 

* **Name of the Wind** As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.
* **Monster hunter international** Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.
* Tried **The Malazan Book of the Fallen**: just couldn't get into the story.
* And all my friends keep begging me to give the **Dark Tower Series** another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.

How are you connecting this sociopathy to anarcho-capitalism?

If anything I'd say it's anarchists other than ""anarcho""-capitalists who would be the intellectual enablers of this sort of sociopathy. ""Property is theft"", ya know? Ancaps are pretty big on private property, unlike the others."	"Proudhon's phrase ""property is theft"" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property.

If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that *anything* was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism.

Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:

&gt; Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint.  
For the moment, he is still drinking beer,  
Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water.  
When others cry savagely ""down with the kings""  
Stirner immediately supplements ""down with the laws also.""  
Stirner full of dignity proclaims;  
You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free.  
You become accustomed to slavery  
Down with dogmatism, down with law.  
  
Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give *indirect* platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ).

I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the *least* keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - 1) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and 2) It's ability to distribute consensus has *so much more* potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth). So much so that I imagine almost any modern anarcho-*communist* society would also want base their communications upon it."	Implicit

Players at 7 chem are still getting their stats boosted above their base stats, but not to the full boost of a 10 chem player.

135	czj58l8	czj7xfi	AdviceAnimals	Methamphetamine is the most worrisome, as its chemical composition, a methylated amine, allows it to penetrate deeper into the brain causing a more potent effect on the dopaminergic system than say adderall or similar amphetamines. Extended, heavy abuse of amphetamines could lead to restructuring of how catecholamines are being neuromodulated, through inhibition of receptors from extended adrenergic agonism. Although I don't think it is likely at all that someone would die under anesthesia after having a couple adderall a day or so beforehand, it never hurts to disclose this information to your anesthesiologist.
