27		czjdjdi	LucidDreaming		"I remember when I was trying to learn japanese that in one of my dreams I met a group of people that were speaking japanese to me and I was speaking back as if I knew what I was talking about.  And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language.  But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say.  

I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn.  Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness.  I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about.  Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style.  

But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream.  

I've never met someone that could.  And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to.  It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about.  I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt.

33		czjfsbl	AsianParentStories		"I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. 4 years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying 4 yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want.

 Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. 

It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this. "	Not

47		czja1wt	Fantasy		"I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes:
 I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well.  It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. 
I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes.
And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than 4 star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. 

Current top series:

* **Way of Kings/Words of Radiance**: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)
* **Song of Ice and Fire:** Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change. 
* **LOTR** Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling,  it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is *fantasy* with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.
* **Riyria Revelations**: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.
* **Dresden Files** I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role. 
* **Hard Magic Series**: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.
* **Ready Player One**:Just a fun read. The 80's were fun.
* **Enders Game**: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.
* **Wheel of Time series**: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.
* **Hitchhikers Guide series**: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.
* **Asimov's Foundation Series** More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.
* **Dragon Riders of Pern**:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?
* **Harry Potter**: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.
* **Artemis Fowl series**: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. 

Books I like:

* **Mistborn**: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.
* **Same for everything else written by Butcher**: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.
* **Legend of Drizzt**: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **Iron Druid series** I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **The Shadow of What was Lost** : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book.

Do not like: 

* **Name of the Wind** As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.
* **Monster hunter international** Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.
* Tried **The Malazan Book of the Fallen**: just couldn't get into the story.
* And all my friends keep begging me to give the **Dark Tower Series** another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.

50	cziybeh	czja61e	Jazz	It is still there. My son, up until a few months ago lived on 94th and west end. We went there all the time.	"Yeah, great club. I walked in one blustery MLK day a few years back after leaving what I thought was a jazz concert but wasn't, in the theater on 92nd &amp; caught a great piano, bass &amp; drum trio. I was on a 1st date, there was no 2nd, so I humbly asked to sit in. The pianist graciously agreed &amp; we settled on Miles' ""Four"". 


Then the pianist picked up a trumpet &amp; the drummer counted off at an insane tempo. I get it, see if the new kid can keep up. I did, praise God, &amp; they were very cool, asked if I wanted to do another but it was time to go so I promised I'd be back. 


All in all, a fun time and world class players, to be sure. Plying my trade in Palm Beach these days. Love NYC, hate winter. There are a number of jazz venues down here but not like up north. I'm excited to see Joey DeFrancesco next month in Ft. Lauderdale. 


I recently picked up a 1946 Hammond CV &amp; am studying with Tony Monaco via Skype. Whoever tells you, piano/organ, same thing, all keys, doesn't have a clue. Playing Jimmy Smith style requires bass lines in LH leaving only 5 fingers to make the changes. As a pianist for over 1/2 century, standard MO is splitting chord tones between RH/LH, I'm going insane attempting to visualize chords voiced 100% differently.


For the most part I keep my root-7 in the LH on piano using RH for the color tones. On Hammond, I play the color tones in RH but 3-7 is missing. Inserting them in the bass line isn't the same thing. A truly humbling experience but Tony is on a 3-4 week Asian tour &amp; I'm working on ""Song For My Father"". Really digging ""Groove"" Hoimes' version, as Tony's, Joey's &amp; others. If you know of any other hip Hammond versions, turn me on to them, please.

I've had a similar thought, like if genders are a representation of one's place on a spectrum between male and female, shouldn't ""Bro"" or ""Tomboy"" be genders?

I personally would like to distance myself from ""Men"", perhaps as a ""Gentleman""?"	"&gt;In its original meaning, the term denoted a man of the lowest rank of the English gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers and the younger sons of baronets, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession, and thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. In this sense, the word equates with the French gentilhomme (""nobleman""), which latter term has been, in Great Britain, long confined to the peerage. Maurice Keen points to the category of ""gentlemen"" in this context as thus constituting ""the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France"".

In no way is the offense amazing, but again bottom 5 is just a ludicrous statement and you obviously don't have any actual information supporting your statement considering how far off base they are. I'd suggest reading up. This is a division opponent and one of the biggest rivalries in football. There is no excuse for you to be so poorly informed on this team."	I'm not poorly informed at all.

I got the VIP ticket and we have an early access to the place along with Q&amp;A session with her, some merch and a pre-show/soundcheck. But she became sick 2 days before the concert and lost her voice so she canceled her shows for NY and Cleveland. I won passes for a pizza party with her at a radio station but I was told it was canceled due to her condition. I thought the concert was canceled as well, then around 1pm I realized nobody has emailed me about the cancelation and started freaking out. My only transportation there is a train ride that goes for 1hr and 20min, and the VIP ticket holders have to be there by 4 or we'll miss the whole program set for us. I got there around 5:30, I was crying in the train on the way there too. I went in and told them I'm a VIP and the lady named Victoria was the one who gave me my ticket and merch. She told me to wait for a few minutes and she'll be back. She came back and told me to follow her, she asked why I was late and I told her everything. She also told me how Alessia's been feeling and that they didn't do the soundcheck to preserve her voice for the show tonight. She then followed up with ""so, how about a private, one-on-one meet and greet with her?"" in my head I started freaking out and she took me to her dressing room. It was the craziest thing ever. When she came up the first words that came out of my mouth were ""are you okay? How are you?"" all she can do was mouth the words ""yeah, I'm doing okay. Hopefully I can sing tonight"". I gave her my gift, took pics with her and have her signed some stuff. She's the sweetest and most down to earth famous person I've ever met. She then hugged me and said ""I hope to see you out there"". A few minutes after I left she then tweeted and DMed me on Twitter. That was just insane.

The main difference is economy of scale. There are many dishes that I would use 3 separate pans for in a kitchen but only 1 for at home to save time on cleanup and be able to multi task easier. The same with industrial ovens, dozens of knives (although you still use a chef's knife for 95% of things), etc.

Plating and decoration make food look better even when it's not, I usually skip that at home but the food's the same quality.

Ingredient selection is definitely hampered at home, without wholesale prices and the guarantee that I'll use expensive things before they expire, but that's something that can be partially avoided with planning, or just tolerated if I really want to make a knockout dish.

The false equivalency comes from, if you read my comments, acting like the GOP and Dems in the legislation operate the same way. Yes, the dems can get a slight majority and and carry themselves through because they are provably of one organizational mind, as proven by the DNC emails leaked, whereas, as you would've seen if you read my comment, the RNC has Heritage Foundation types and then the Rand Paul libertarian types, and soon will have full on Trump types if the midterms go as expected. It's a divided party that can't agree with itself. While I would say having more than one thought process is a good thing in politics, to say ""Oh, they're all good because pure numbers"" is wrong.

TL;DR: Read, don't skim"	"You should never assume that the person you having a discussion with is dumber than you are. I read your comment but I think you're misusing the term false equivalency.

To reiterate, I think one-mindedness comes from being in power for a long time. I believe the as more time passes the Republicans will eventually conform around specific goals and work rather cohesively. That may be around the WH or it may not. It kind of depends on what their constituents want.

I know that the RNC has many fractions. What I'm saying very bluntly is that if they can't figure out those fractions is screwed because then they'll accomplish nothing and lose power.

The reason why comparing the RNC to the DNC isn't false equivalency, in summary, is because they were ""hired"" to a do the same job; run the country.

The the RNC can't figure out a way to do that effectively then they're not doing their jobs and people who vote R will become and should become pissed off.

As for Trump, he needs to keep campaigning on it. He should keep on message and repeating that message until the job gets done. 

Without that focus and effort the RNC gets to fight among itself and get nothing done.

Just imagine that Trump laid down a clear idea of what Trumpcare was, what you would get and why it was better. Not just Obamacare sucks but ""this is my plan. This is why it's better.""

Pluto is just one of many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).

When Pluto was discovered and classified as a planet, we didn't know that these other very similar and very close together bodies existed.

If we classify Pluto as a planet, then we have to classify many (or all) of the other KBOs as planets to avoid arbitrarily picking just one or two of them and calling them planets.

And since we're letting the Kuiper Belt Objects in on the planetary action, we'd be forced to look at the Asteroid Belt again. The same process that happened with Pluto and the other KBOs *already happened* with Ceres and the other Asteroids in the 19th century. The first few Asteroids were considered planets until we realized there's tons of them, and they all far more resemble each other than they do planets. 

If we count all of them then we're left with a mess of hundreds or thousands of planets. So instead of that, the IAU decided to follow prior precedent, and Pluto and the other KBOs went the way of the Asteroids. Unlike the KBOs and Asteroids, the 8 planets are all *unique.*"	Not
