So they get distracted by Netflix and Marvel Movies and all other sorts of low-impact information. It's a *Brave New World* sort of argument, I guess. There's too much information out there for any one person to sift through, so they just don't bother. As you say, if they ever need it, they just ask Siri, why bother paying attention? 

OR they do, but they focus on simple, high-emotion stories and ignore the complex underlying mechanisms and laws at work. They don't need to know about that, they just need to get outraged and demand that something be done. In lieu of building a better world (which takes effort and a solid understanding of reality) they complain about the world they got and hope somebody else fixes it.

Take, for instance, this whole hullabaloo around the Fine Brothers, rather than targeting the underlying IP system that enables them to even do what they're doing.

The nice thing is that the internet has the ability to teach you good information AND the tools to make use of such information for your own advancement. I try to make this sub such a place. But you have to have some level of underlying intelligence to bootstrap into rational thinking.

Storage Pool

A storage pool can consist of heterogeneous physical disks. Notice that a physical drive in the context of Windows Server 2012 Storage Space is simply raw storage from a variety of types of drives including USB, SATA, and SAS drives as well as an attached VHD/VHDX file as shown below. With a storage pool, Windows Server 2012 presents the included physical drives as one logical entity. The allocating the capacity of a storage pool is to first create a virtual disk based on the storage pool followed by creating and mapping a volume Later a drive letter or an empty folder. And with the mapping, the volume based on a virtual disk of a storage pool will appear and work just like a conventional hard drive or folder in Windows Explorer.

seems like with 'simple' you still get raid 0 like performance, which if a single disk dies I'm screwed."	Not

You cannot tell by looking at your ejaculate if it contains sperm or not. Sperm are too small to see with the naked eye. 

Masturbation does not cause or contribute to infertility, though if you have low counts then refraining for a couple of days may help stockpile your reserves for a sample. It also won't make you blind or make you grow hair on your palms."	Not

seriously though do what you believe in
