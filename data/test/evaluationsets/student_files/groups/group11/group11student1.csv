91	dkyp1gx	dkzylzp	DebateReligion	">Well, why not? Do you believe that they failed the sudoku? Do you think they've misremembered where they put the 9? If you don't have a justified reason for disregarding their statement, then you really should consider what they have to say, even if you ultimately still decide to not go with what they said.

Unless their anecdote included how they came to there conclusion, then there is nothing for me to consider, there is nothing to analyze. If they are right, there should be a way for me to come to the same conclusion on my own. If they are wrong and I trust that information, I may have to restart the entire Sudoku, as I likely would not likely remember every superjacent choice I made based on that wrong information. 

If you are going to be making a choice of any importance, you need to be able to verify the information you are given. I would only act on unverified information as an act of desperation, if forced to make a choice with no other information to act on.

An anecdote could be a lie, or simple misremembering. While there may be no reason to assume an anecdote is false, there is also no reason to assume an anecdote is true. 

Any confirmable data, no matter how minor, is better to go on that any amount of anecdotes, no matter how great."	"Sorry for the wordiness. I do tend to get wordy.

&gt; Unless their anecdote included how they came to there conclusion, then there is nothing for me to consider, there is nothing to analyze. If they are right, there should be a way for me to come to the same conclusion on my own. If they are wrong and I trust that information, I may have to restart the entire Sudoku, as I likely would not likely remember every superjacent choice I made based on that wrong information. 

Well, actually, their anecdote does contain something for you to consider: they claim they did/finished the sudoku, right? That means that if their answer was correct, they should have gotten no inconsistencies, leading you to believe that their placement of the 9 was possibly/probably correct. Unless you interpret their statement of ""I did the sudoku earlier"" to *not* include ""I finished the sudoku earlier, with no inconsistencies"".

On the other hand, if I listened to your friend (somewhere along the way, I decided he's your friend eventhough, looking back, you never specified that. but it's easier to reference this way, so I will continue with it) and put a 9 there, would I necessarily be a fool at that point? Remember that we live within a timeline that we have no control over; I *can't* know whether the 9 truly goes there or not until after I've finished the puzzle. After the puzzle is complete, I'll be able to know the truth, *whether I trusted your friend or not* (because this is incorporates an exhaustive example, unlike with the bathroom thing where failing to see the bathroom could prompt the people to keep saying ""it's further back"" or ""you just missed it"" or something else), but at the very point where I listen to your friend and put the 9 in the box while you don't listen to your friend and refuse to put the 9 in the box, neither you nor I can possibly know whether it is correct or not. But the point of listening isn't to know whether he is correct or not; it's to decide whether it's a potentially good idea to act on the information or not.

(realistically, I like solving sudoku on my own, so I would actually get annoyed if someone told me ""put a 9 there"" and I probably wouldn't be one to listen. Not because I distrust them, but because ""it's *my* game that I'm playing"")

And if you set the standard super high to the point where you don't trust anyone else, does that still mean nobody else is allowed to trust anyone else? What about teachers? If I take a math class and my teacher tells me that 2+2=4, am I allowed to trust the teacher prior to ""solving the proof"" for myself? (solving the proof being different from just getting the answer, as mathematically solving the proof means working out all of the underlying mechanics of *how/why* 2 plus 2 equals 4, which is actually a bit more difficult than intuitively putting two objects with two other objects and claiming its now a group of four objects. http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/as2446/224.pdf as an example of exactly that proof. That kind of proving isn't taught in grade 1 where we learn 2+2=4, so we necessarily trust the teacher when they teach us a system that we haven't verified for ourselves yet. As a further aside, this pure mathematical proving falls under Rationalism, knowledge gained purely from thought alone, rather than Empiricism, knowledge gained through sensory observation. Knowledge gained through Rationalism is actually considered stronger in terms of ""truthiness"" compared to Empiricism, but only so long as it rests on Deductive Reasoning as only Deductive Reasoning can provide true conclusions so long as the premises are true. Inductive Reasoning and Abductive Reasoning cannot give true conclusions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wrCpLJ1XAw&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR&amp;index=3 for that reference)

&gt; If you are going to be making a choice of any importance, you need to be able to verify the information you are given. I would only act on unverified information as an act of desperation, if forced to make a choice with no other information to act on.

I don't think that's the case at all. Going back to the washroom example, if a bunch of people all told you ""we saw a washroom around the corner"", then ""you going to see for yourself whether there is a washroom there"" is itself the ""acting on unverified information"" as you act *to* verify it.

In the sudoku example, you continuing on with the sudoku is a form of verification because eventually you will learn for yourself whether the 9 goes there or not, but you set it up so that your verification there is simply from ignoring what your friend had to say and working it out for yourself. I, on the other hand, listened to what your friend had to say and worked it out from there; if your friend is right then I will have no inconsistencies, whereas if your friend is wrong then I will have an inconsistency prior to finishing the puzzle (unless I make a mistake. But then, even though you didn't listen to your friend, you could still make a mistake too, so that's a negligible thing).

&gt; An anecdote could be a lie, or simple misremembering. While there may be no reason to assume an anecdote is false, there is also no reason to assume an anecdote is true. 

And you don't have to assume the anecdote is true. The anecdote is simply someone's claim about something they observed. It's a *reason* to believe that they *could* be right, not that they *necessarily are* right.

&gt; Any confirmable data, no matter how minor, is better to go on that any amount of anecdotes, no matter how great.

The anecdotes lead you in the direction of verification. The anecdotes themselves are not the verification. Just like any other evidence; evidence points towards the truth of the larger picture but it not *itself* the truth of the larger picture.

Say you walk around a building and see two cars in the street at odd angles, one of the doors smashed in on one car, and the front bender smashed in on the other car: these are all observations of pieces of data that you could try to piece together yourself, but those pieces themselves are not the full story of the truth of what happened and you use a lot of guesswork as glue to put them together. If someone else comes along and claims ""I saw the car crash. That car there hit that car there"" then their story is not the full story of the truth of what happened either. Each piece is a truth *in its own right*, but in regards to the larger story, each piece is just part of a larger puzzle that we try to piece together. Anecdotes, which is to say other peoples' claims of their observations, are just like your own personal observations in that they are just pieces of the puzzle.

And in the car crash, the only way to *certainly* know what happened, would be to watch it yourself; anything less, including watching a video of the crash right after the video was taken, is merely trusting another source; and thus we get into primary sources versus secondary sources (maybe I should have gone this route earlier). You are a primary source of anything you directly observe or think or feel. [EDIT]But everyone else is a also primary source of their own thoughts and feelings and observations of events[/EDIT]. Sure it's better to get as close to a primary source as possible to the point where ""you being a primary source"" is the best possible scenario, but sometimes we just plain can't get close to a primary or even secondary source, such as in the case of history from thousands of years ago.

EDIT: Physical recordings are also considered primary sources so long as they either directly record the event, in the case of video, or are created by people who are primary sources, ie an eye-witness account.

EDIT 2: for more on primary and secondary sources https://library.ithaca.edu/sp/subjects/primary and http://www.uvic.ca/library/research/tips/primvsec/index.php

EDIT 3: Or maybe I should take the angle of reversing the roles of a scenario. Someone comes up to you and asks where the bathroom is, and since you just used the bathroom, you can tell them ""it's right around the corner"". Or, you just finished a sudoku and your friend is having a hard time of the exact same one (what are the odds!) so you decide to help him out by giving him a hint: ""9 goes in that square""."

Clearly Ozpin was preparing to do something with his cane--which he wielded like a sword rather than a staff/baton--before the school shook.  What was it?  Activating some sort of power?  Activating a mechanism?  Argh, I hate teasing!

Also, in the end shot when Cinder was on the roof watching--I think she now knows, after seeing Pyrrha move towards Ozpin, that Pyrrha is the chosen candidate.  She already knew that Ozpin held the keys to the Fall Maiden, and his appearance confirms that Pyrrha is the new target (both for the powers and for Cinder).   However, that said, we don't know that Cinder has another glove, so she can't take the powers that way--she'd have to kill Pyrrha, and she'd have to force herself into Pyrrha's last thoughts (unlikely, given Jaune's presence).  No, I think they fight, and they fight to a draw--leaving Cinder to return another day next volume.

Well done episode.  However, Ironwood's survival is doubtful unless he has metal plates in the back of his head (or if those Atlasian soldiers also have terrible aim at point-blank range); otherwise, they should reasonably have executed him.

So Merc and Emerald will be sent into the school, Cinder will attempt to hack her way into the elevator and interrupt the transfer (which she fails at, because otherwise the plot goes haywire)--Ozpin drives her off but injures/exhausts himself in the process, Jaune defends Pyrrha, Yang finds Merc and battles him while Emerald has a crisis of conscience, Weiss protects Blake with her new summon when Blake fails against Adam, and hopefully Ruby can hand it to Neo (though I have my doubts since Yang is the better hand-to-hand fighter and still lost) before addressing Torchwick.  Glynda and Qrow take out the Wyvern, Port and Oobleck can handle the gryffins.  I know all of this won't be wrapped up neatly before the end of this volume--all the Bad Guys can't be defeated, else we wouldn't have continuation of the series--but some of those fights, I hope, end up in the Good Guys' favor."
