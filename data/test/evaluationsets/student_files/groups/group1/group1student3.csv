5	dkz4mby	dkzobbh	AskReddit	"Not political propaganda, but Rick and Morty brought back szechuan sauce.

Ever since the season premiere of Rick and Morty, people have been repeating szechuan sauce at each other like a pop-culture Freemason handshake. Lo and behold, at the start of the season proper, McDonald's creates a limited release of this obtuse dipping sauce from 1998 most people don't actually remember tasting (if it were really that popular at its release, McDonald's would have made use of it since then). 

People are high-fiving thinking ""we did it"" when McDonald's announces the sauces return (around the same time as the proper season start). This is classical cross promotion at its finest. McDonald's get a PR spike in a demographic it has been spending a lot of money, [and making stupid commercials to court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTxJZyKymA). The premier might as well have been a giant focus group to turn attention their way. If it all had backlash, then it would simply be a gag from a comedy show, but it didn't. 

Rick and Morty advertised for McDonald's, and now we're seeing a very traditional cross promotion and everybody is patting themselves on the back like they made it happen and weren't manipulated the entire way through. "	I totally agree it was an advertisement, but I'd like to counter with this: Who cares? If it was a good part of the overall show and the viewers enjoyed it... Does it really matter? Should we completely avoid using companies just to stop them from potentially advertising?	Not

"You're not ignorant. Bio *is* harder than Envi Sci, that's a fact. Only 5% of people get a 5 on AP Bio. 

Don't waste your time taking AP Envi Sci, stay with AP Lang.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

29	dkzoc7b	dkzpnui	SeattleWA	Tfw you respect that dude's username, but not his opinions. That callous self-interest shit drives me nuts.	"I didn't mean it as strongly as it sounded, I don't believe  in eugenics, and homeopathy should be stopped.. but I have a hard time feeling  bad for someone that bought special shoes to lose weight..

It's difficult  to find the line where it's the persons fault or the salesman, it's not all black and white.. a person that buys a snake oil drug that's supposed to cure something is one thing,  because medicine  is complex and not something  a layman would understand, mix that with the desperation  of an awful disease it's understandable... so I do feel sympathy  for a person  caught in a scam like that..

But if you think a pair of shoes will help you lose weight, then you deserve to lose the 80 bucks you spent on those shoes, because it's pretty  common  knowledge that there is no magic weight loss thing..

But if you are running dungeons/fractals with people that are not very skilled at the game, a healer can really help to carry those people. 

So in conclusion, only raids need tanks and healers. As for the other content in the game, you shouldn't need those roles, but very low skilled players might make use of it."	To be fair, druids at high level fractals can be very nice. Not necessary, but very, very convenient.	Not

37	dgyoq2c	dgyrwj1	pie	OP, can I get a recipe? I've tried the two in my Pie Town, NM cookbook but they both turned out too dry	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

60	czj04w0	czjcihf	OutOfTheLoop	Who doesn't like popcorn though	My ex	Not
61	dgydx2a	dgz2gv8	Games	"I wasn't the impression that Bioware was gutted of talent, I was and am under the impression that Bioware's talent is mismanaged.

I don't doubt for a second that they are immensely talented. But when you look at their more recent games, its obvious that their talent is not being reflected on all facets of their work."	"The Javik DLC from Mass Effect 3 is a good example of why management and publishing is a problem. They kept needing to extend and got pushback. Javik was supposed to be a bigger part of the story, but they had to cut it to work on other things. They kept a bit of it on disc because they wanted to finish it after the game was ""finished"" (already rated etc). After that, they finished From Ashes and it was ready by Day 1. So it looked like Bioware decided to cut a chunk of the story out for a few bucks when it actually wasn't the case at the end of the day. 

I do feel that Andromeda was mismanaged by both dev and publisher though. It's so obviously a rush job in the areas that were hard. Like branching story and those little details. They worked on combat and open worlds instead. 

So they spent 40 million on it, which is a bit too low honestly. ME3 was 40 million. Andromeda was a whole new engine AND a revamp of everything gameplay related. "	Not

72	dgw1e53	dgytn92	Spokane	"Does shit like this really need to be a news story?  For all we know, it could have been some 14-year-olds who thought they were being really edgy and mischievous.  

If you're so frightened by a bit of offensive graffiti, I hope you never enter a public restroom stall."	"&gt; For all we know, it could have been some 14-year-olds who thought they were being really edgy and mischievous.

The problem with this argument is that it's just as likely that it was a KKK member in a hood. Either way, it's bad. Either way, it's hurtful. Either way, it's disgusting. What difference does it make?"	Not

76	czjb8s5	czjc0iy	ADHD	I didn't know it was free for a year as a student! I just started going back to school and have been debating getting ynab for about 5-6 months! Thanks you may have just saved my financial future!	Oh, I'm glad! If you can't find the student discount area on the website, you can email their support team with your student ID info &amp; schedule for this year and they'll give you a 1-yr activation code. You can repeat yearly as long as you're in school! Hopefully by the time you're out, you can easily afford the official licence, since you'll be a great money manager by then :)	Not
77	dgyxue6	dgyyegz	iRacing	"Not really, I keep hearing stories of how some of the top racers are still using G27's etc.

However a nicer set of pedals and a good wheel might help with your enjoyment of the game."	"They might be using g27 as a wheel (think some of them even turn off the FFB), but they are definitely not using the stock pedals for it.

If any equipment will help, it'd be better pedals."	Not
78		dgyte76	Fantasy		I can't bloody stand them.  It's input overload for me, I find the background noise to be so distracting that I can't even process the words. That being said a lot of people have enjoyed them, and I'm glad they did, I just can't stand them personally.	Not
79		dkzsaec	KCRoyals		Soria	Not
80	dgysxea	dgyt7dd	DotA2	They get it, and so do I when I play offlane, but it makes their laning worse until PMS is complete. Pretty sure they would prefer being able to get 200g Stout Shield->PMS rather than 300g Slipperies->PMS, or even get Iron Talon+Stout Shield.	For sure, it would be better, but PMS adds so much value in lane, that most of the time I take risk of having less regen and rush to that 200g and complete PMS in lane.	Not
81		dkzojg6	Warframe		"The [Prime Vault](https://www.warframe.com/prime-vault) will be available until sometime August 1st. In my opinion ,it is worth picking up. It contains a lot of good weapons. Rhino Prime is very strong, and Mag Prime is average.

Prime Access is so-so right now. Oberon Prime is pretty average. Silva &amp; Aegis Prime and Sybaris Prime are good.

The Steam Packs are not worth it at all."	Not
82	dgyt6s4	dgyu4cw	Jeep	You don't need Rigid for a backup light or a light bar for that matter, you can mount any old led like this one - KAWELL 2PCS 18w LED Work Light Off Road Led Lights Bar Fog Driving Bar Jeep Lamp (2 Pack Flood Black) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HT642WY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_khObzb20004HT	so any led will fit im guessing?	Not
83		dgyvrez	MakeupAddiction		"I have oily skin with acne scars and redness, and some lingering adult acne. I also have minor discoloration from psoriasis around my eyebrows. I have had good results using Clinique's beyond perfecting foundation--it's pretty full coverage on me (without looking cakey) and has never irritated my skin. 

For a low-maintenance, everyday work look where I want sheerer coverage, I LOVE Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC cream. This has a very natural finish but still enough coverage to tackle covering blemishes--and never any skin irritation. I'm on my second tube of this now, I get it at CVS and they always offer promotions for PF products. I think it's a great value product for the price point! 

I've also found Too Faced's Primed and Poreless primer to be a great daily primer for smoothing out the look of textured skin for acne scars, and this also hasn't clogged my pores. 

Edit: additional info

84		dkzsnuf	WTF		"Where do you find a cow with no legs?

85	dkzuizr	dkzvws3	FindingFennsGold	I almost hope you find it so you can learn what income tax is.	Gifts are not reported as income. Look it up.	Not
86	dkzn6s3	dkznovu	Roadcam	"> Show your working then?

I did. You said that normal overtaking would take 7 seconds if I'm going 120 and other car is going 80. You also said that this includes 2 seconds of buffer space before and after the car, this leaves 3 seconds to cover the 5 metres of the actual car itself. That's wrong and the numbers are taken out of thin air. They're not related to the real world in any way whatsoever. 

>Why does the video say you need half a mile of overtaking space then?

I don't know, maybe it's because that video is almost fifty years old? Cars were a lot shittier back then than they are today. 

>Seems like your link applies to motor vehicles and not bicycles?

Google Translate skips a few lines for some reason. 

What it says is that it's illegal to move livestock, ride on horses, ride bicycles, mopeds, all versions of quad bikes and all other modes of transport except for cars, motorbikes, trikes and cars with trailers, unless their top speed due to their construction or mechanical state is lower than 60km/h. 

>Cyclists ride on the road just like trucks do.

Cyclists can cycle on the side of the road, making it a lot easier to overtake them safely, because you don't have to go all the way into the oncoming lane. "	"&gt; They're not related to the real world in any way whatsoever.

The safe following distance for vehicles is 2-3 seconds. This is not some number out of thin air.

&gt; What it says is that it's illegal to move livestock, ride on horses, ride bicycles, mopeds, all versions of quad bikes and all other modes of transport 

This is all roadways or *motorways*? There is a difference between ""motorways"" and ""country roads"""	Not

93	czio29a	czj9x2c	AskReddit	"To be fair, many washing machines are different and have lots of different, crazy and seemingly similar settings with vague explanations. 

Most of my friends don't know how to use my microwave oven even though they've used their own for the past 10 years. On my microwave oven, you first have to choose the ""mode"" you want to use. For example, microwaving, heating, defrosting. If you don't do this, it defaults to some kind of strange setting that starts at 90 seconds, and I have no idea what it is. 

[I recorded a video of my crazy microwave for you guys](https://vid.me/MNzN)"	"Oh my god, so much this.  I'm studying overseas right now and living in a dorm, and some of the native students were making fun of us international students for needing to have instructions posted on the washing machines on how to use them.  They kept going off about how we're rich assholes who have never even done our own laundry before.

No!  I've been doing my own laundry for years.  I just don't know my way around the washing machines in this country!  Yes, once I figure out the buttons it's fairly simple, but they are not the same buttons on an American machine and thus it takes a few minutes the first time to make sure you have actually set the machine to clean the damn clothes."

96		dgz12tx	RPGdesign		Just my first unfounded impression -- I'm skeptical of a system like that, because it could too easily be utterly pointless or vastly overpowered. Think of Quidditch - the regular game is utterly pointless because catching the Snitch (or whatever it's called) is vastly overpowered.	Not
97		czj7h28	GrandTheftAutoV		"As much as I know everyone hates it, lately I've been driving around in the armored kuruma purely because recently I've been heist hopping.

However, with Feb. coming up, I'm gonna make an attempt to complete all daily objectives for the month, which means a lot more freemode time, so I'll probably roll around in my Sultan RS or Shitzu Hakuchou."	Not

100		czj4g3c	BlackPeopleTwitter		How new York niggas greet their pops.	Not
101	czi86ed	czjeqr7	Flipping	Is it just the Sony's that sell well? Or any portable cd player?	Sony products sell loads quicker than say Panasonic, Coby, Phillips or unknown brands. If I see a Sony cd player, I don't need to really think, I just throw it in my cart. Other cd player brands, I always check the exact model before I buy and most of the time don't end up buying. People have a very strong preference for the Sony brand over all the others.	Not
102	dkzwsr5	dkzxoph	KFTPRDT	It seems great; but I don't know what current list would slot this in, or if the RNG would be worth the risk.	"Well yeah... Blizz adds cards to encourage new decktypes, not slot into existing viable ones.

*He pauses for a moment, thinking.*

Are you still that...that Quarian girl? Or are you someone  different, someone... new?"	"We have both the memories of when we were Quarian and when we were Geth. Although, our memories as Geth only date back to our Quarian birth, as it was found that memories from before the subjects birth increased rejection rate and subsequent death by 57.35%. We now realize that we had to be stopped. Such a waste of life...

*She takes a moment to collect herself and moves on.*

And we are both that quarian girl, and the Geth that created us. And we are neither. We... are our own being. A blend of the two that made us.

"	Not
104	czijv76	czj5g10	MachineLearning	Way more than 99 percent. Fan Hui, who it readily beat in five games out of five, is ranked something among the thousand best players in the world IIRC. So at best/worst, it can only be beaten by a thousand people of many millions of players.	Based on the description though, I think Fan Hui would likely win the next best of five.  It seems he spent some moves testing the machine, plus he's used to teaching amateurs and made a mistake or two from that.	Not

Everything goes into the fermenter, and after cold crashing and gelatin, I make sure I leave behind an inch or two of beer in the fermenter to avoid sucking anything into the keg. I usually end up with very clear beers this way. The ""clear wort = clear beer"" theory has pretty much been debunked"	I don't keg, any good resources on how to use gelatin?	Not

109		dkzrt6g	Monitors		"I just bought the AOC AG271QG as an upgrade from the ROG Swift PG278QR. The AOC has everything in your title for $650 (plus overclockable to 165hz), and sturdiness from metal parts. It comes in Wednesday. I'll update this comment then.

Update: The AG271QG is a great panel. You can immediately tell it's an IPS, and loaded up with Overwatch, I didn't notice any dropped frames or screen tearing. Secondly, I went to lightbleedtest.com, and found no excessive light bleed anywhere. However, the top right corner of the screen does glow more than the rest of the panel. Thus to say, it's inconsistent, but the bleed isn't horrendous. Lastly, it's designed really well. All the stand pieces are metal. I feel confident it can survive a desk bump. It also has a hook behind the monitor as a headphone holder, and there's a hole in the middle of the stand for cable management. The title is 27"" 1440p 144hz IPS G-Sync, and it sells for $650. All in all, sensational."	Not
110	dgyssc8	dgyt561	InitialDvideos	"He went beyond youtube, he's ""big"" on twitch now. Not streaming right now but here's his link: https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985.

Basically he stopped doing youtube for his own reasons, it like became boring to him, but he still wants to do non-gaming-related projects IIRC ([further explained here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvOeZa4uvI)). He has a [second channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL7DDQWP6x7wy0O6L5ZIgxg/videos) where an editor dumps a highlight of past twitch streams. He's happy and entertains people weekly on stream, so if it works for him, all the better. He's got a girl too.

If you followed Star, the same kind of thing happened to him too, at around the same time. [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Niichts/videos), [2nd channel with highlight streams](https://www.youtube.com/user/4O4STAR/videos), [twitch](https://twitch.tv/ster)."	Yeah I know star got popular on twitch. Good to see that jerma is doing well for himself.	Not
111	dgynjms	dgyvn9p	StardustCrusaders	Thanks for your compliment. I guess I have ended up making a full volume cover with the new border design [here](http://i.imgur.com/x4APwiP.jpg), it is a shame that I never got to post this version here early since it took long to make it.	Yeah that is a shame, it looks really nice.	Not
112	dgyuwed	dgyv03x	AskMen	We need another qb to take over in the next couple years, but I don't know if Dobbs is the right one. Undersized for the duel threat that he is, and has accuracy issues. Still, if the steelers can coach him up, he could be good.	Nobody is the be all end all right when they enter the NFL. Look at Brady Quinn's career for proof. Just because you were who you were in college doesn't mean your pro career will be similar. He went nowhere while pro, and even though Dobbs has shortcomings, he can absolutely be tuned to be what we need.	Not
113	czjazve	czjbca5	SubredditDrama	Really? ~~Every Lenin/Maoist group in existence~~ you could have fooled me.	Just go to /r/socialism or /r/FULLCOMMUNISM and ask if they want democracy. They do.	Not

Edit: The Landrover dealer is gone in mine as well but I went to my parts menu and it still is there so if they pulled it from the game will they pull out parts back from us and give us credit with bronze keys since they are essentially useless to us.

My advice is to keep doing what you are doing. I see you have been asking questions here before, so you are obviously educating yourself further in pursuit of your mutual satisfaction. As long as you are keeping lines of communication open, you will find the satisfaction that you are looking for.

141	dgyp3c5	dgywlpq	MMA	"Jacare is very different from Maia, Jacare has always been way too willing to stand and strike, he's got power and has seen success there.

Maia on the other hand desperately tries to get it to the ground constantly, never gives up on it and he has become an amazing wrestler. (Wouldn't be surprised if wrestling was 99% of all of his camps for the past few years) I really doubt Masvidal's takedown defence is going to hold up against Maia's style.

If he can get it to the ground Masvidal will have nowhere near the ""success"" there Gunnar had. (Gunnar got dominated but not submitted, I would be shocked if Masvidal lasted more than a few minutes)"	I believe in maias takedowns but i also think masvidal has good defensive bjj. I think maia will have a hard time submitting him but will hold him down and dominate.	Not

145	dkzxzzv	dkzy0cy	CasualMTG	"A good way to think of Magic cards is like this;

All cards with a mana cost are spells.

When you cast a spell, it 'releases' the spell onto the battlefield from its card, like cracking open an egg. This is why spells like [[approach of the second sun]] still trigger even if countered.

So when you use up your spell, the shell goes into the garbage (graveyard) and whatever the card had 'locked inside' is now released under your control, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

What the spell contains is not bound by the same restrictions as the spell itself.

To answer your wuestion, yes you get to keep whatever you play as long as it is supposed to last, you only get until the end of turn to cast the spell though."	"

147	cziwkqs	czj56tc	Mavenfall	"Yeah, ""if"" you have a gem draw champion, which I don't. Plus even if I did have him I'd have to make a comp with him in mind since atm he'd take a spot away from someone else. Its not like having him just magically makes everything better, it means you can build a comp that is good against/abuses the same stupid shit as the comps with Bone Knight most likely. I mean I also own Song Maiden, because everyone gets her, but she doesn't fit into my current comp, and I don't mind most people trying to play the card, I dislike the bugs associated with how the card currently works. Once he's on the field for example, Viper Slayer simply can't attack past him properly the game just freaks out and doesn't do anything correctly."	I agree, once the bugs are fixed, it'd be good to see how the card really is.	Not
148		dgyy249	GlobalOffensive		nice, but a better way imo would be to throw the smoke from market. Theres a jumpthrow lineup for it.	Not
