Ever since the season premiere of Rick and Morty, people have been repeating szechuan sauce at each other like a pop-culture Freemason handshake. Lo and behold, at the start of the season proper, McDonald's creates a limited release of this obtuse dipping sauce from 1998 most people don't actually remember tasting (if it were really that popular at its release, McDonald's would have made use of it since then). 

People are high-fiving thinking ""we did it"" when McDonald's announces the sauces return (around the same time as the proper season start). This is classical cross promotion at its finest. McDonald's get a PR spike in a demographic it has been spending a lot of money, [and making stupid commercials to court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTxJZyKymA). The premier might as well have been a giant focus group to turn attention their way. If it all had backlash, then it would simply be a gag from a comedy show, but it didn't. 

Rick and Morty advertised for McDonald's, and now we're seeing a very traditional cross promotion and everybody is patting themselves on the back like they made it happen and weren't manipulated the entire way through.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year.

37	dgyoq2c	dgyrwj1	pie	OP, can I get a recipe? I've tried the two in my Pie Town, NM cookbook but they both turned out too dry	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

85	czj45e3	czj80bh	SchoolIdolFestival	"1. in general, how difficult is it to get the event SR in a score match than a token event? i'd like to at least be able to get the SR in the nozomi score match event coming up, but i've never actually done one of these events so i don't know what they're like.

2. when making a healer team, how should i prioritize the different forms of healer skills? i'm guessing that skills that can trigger every x notes are better than skills that can trigger every x seconds, and that skills that can trigger from an x combo are better than skills that can trigger from x perfects, but i'm not sure how to compare skills from the first two to skills from the second two. also, how important is actually having high stamina on this team? unfortunately most of my healers only have 3 stamina..."	"Events are actually calculated so that getting the base/free sr takes the same amount of lp.

As far as healers go, I'd avoid the combo and perfect ones, because if you're getting a long combo or a lot of perfects you shouldn't need a healer team :P note-based are usually best, and timer-based isn't too bad unless you're tanking expert.

For health, as long as you have about 30 total you should be fine"	Not

Was I as prepared for the blind meta as I responsibly could have been and what were my mistakes and how do I learn from them? Past that, you can attribute it to variance and you have to take solace in the fact that you literally did the best you could. Unlike the other people on here I do view not making top 8 as unsuccessful. But I also believe that if you can get 9th, you can top 8. And if you can top 8, you can top 4 and if you can top 4 you can take FIRST. Never doubt yourself and your potential. it gets in the way of sick plays.	Not

92	dgyw9yj	dgywizx	Nerf	"I think you have quite a bit of missing and/or wrong information

Adding brass will not substantially increase accuracy in a spring-powered blaster - no matter which one you're using. Accuracy mostly derives from the darts you use. For example, if you use Elite darts fired from two similar blasters (one with brass, one without), accuracy will not change between them, at least not enough to warrant the use of brass at all.

Use accurate darts and your accuracy problems go away. No need to over-complicate with brass, especially in an underpowered blaster like the Recon."	What would you consider accurate darts?	Not
93		czjb59c	DebateFascism		"&gt; Could you elaborate on this point?

There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.

&gt; I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me.

You could be right. I am not *such* a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line.

But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

111		dgyuiiy	FireEmblemHeroes		"Honestly, since you have already spent so much, might as well go all the way and get a +10. It's worth it. You might get another one with the perfect IVs for a Vantage build (+Atk -Hp). 

Otherwise, take the +Atk -Spd one, with Fury your Ryoma will hit 60atk with the Atk seal and still have a very respectable 38 Spd."	Not
112		dkzqgyg	PersonalFinanceNZ		Yes, but I shouldn't worry about it. It'll only be a problem if you have a history of bad credit. NZ credit checks aren't really like the States. - for the most part they just want to see if you have a history of missing payments more than anything.	Not

119		dkzpa6o	GlobalOffensiveTrade		"you can go for a good m9 - specialist glove forest ddpat cambo for less then 100 k
"	Not
120		dkzs8gr	OverwatchUniversity		"Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults.

Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult.

Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. 

If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above).

-----------

With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. 

Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen.

If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting 1 shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey.

It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots."	Not
121	cziuud0	czj663v	PokemonShuffle	[verwijderd]	Because it's a free match 3 game.  It's like getting upset when someone cheats in solitaire.	Not
122	dgyx5de	dgyxvmw	MECoOp	">Considering the loot rewards in ME:A are garbage, sure.

Yeah, they're about the same in ME3, and that was satisfying to plenty of people. If you're not in it for the gear rewards and just want to ""complete"" the game, plenty of people cheat. Many many other people just don't play at all, and play something else for more than the grind."	"I took issue with ME3's loot system too, TBH. It felt massively unrewarding in the final DLC when it became apparent you had to run 10~ games for one rank of a random UR. The only reasons it wasn't as widely hated as ME:A's, I think, were there were many excellent guns in all rarities (so the grind to max everything but UR was extremely rewarding), and the game was just a blast to play. You could play with purely the objective of trying new builds or just popping some heads or playing some space wizards and it was all gravy. This game currently lacks both of those things.

But yeah, never liked this loot system ever. It'd make oh so much more sense if the entire game/mode were free to acquire."	Not
123	czja8hp	czjajqy	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	Nice, that's somewhere between more-than-respectable and fast!	stopped the speed reading unless i absolutely need to anymore though, last time i did that the migraine got so bad i threw up :(	Not

126	dkzn4nl	dkzsj1y	Catholicism	"I learned in martial arts class that in real life the right approach is usually to run away.

(I also learned how to take a katana away from someone; but I doubt that is a skill I will be using anytime soon.  Fun, though.)"	Same here, but emphasis on usually. It's entirely different if other people are in danger as well or if you can't get away.	Not
127		dgywybs	TheLeftovers		Fucking brilliant episode. Stuck the landing	Not
128		czjgcbb	Digibro		"1. I think I'd get paid for all 6, as long as you did in fact watch the ad and video all 6 times. I think youtube doens't count views when the person clicks away before a certain point. 

2. I have no idea if there's any rules regarding IPs tho. Youtube doesn't tell us ANYTHING about how we make money through ads, it's all stuff people have figured out largely through conjecture.

3. The ones that appear in the sidebar of the videos themselves I do make money from, but outside of that I have no idea."	Not

136	czj85ni	czj8b9s	AskReddit	Many people who are homeless have mental problems or addiction problems.  Giving them that much cash would not work out well. Not only would the addicts squander the money, Criminals and others would prey upon them.	...Or they would just get an apartment and a nice meal every day.	Not
137	czj0vr8	czjf92j	Watches	If you're looking for rugged might I suggest luminox? Almost unbreakable!  And at your price range. You could get a top of the line one.	"They're all enormous though, won't work at all with 6"" wrists."	Not
138		dkzwdu2	The_Donald		HA!look! the ol limey bastard is back. rinsed penis got gamed	Explicit
139	czivpsh	czjcyp7	Games	It's funny because the game has plenty of bad game design as well. I love the game, but it might just be a tad overrated.	[removed]	Not
140	dkzobs5	dkzynp1	AskReddit	"""How are you?"" Most people really don't give a shit, so stop asking."	"There was a good Dilbert on this several (many?) years ago (paraphrased):

Dogbert:  Do you mean an actual interest in the state of my life and all of it's dramas, tragedies and minor squabbles?  Or do you mean the shallow social idiom?

Person: Uh, I guess I mean the second one.

Dogbert: Fine.  And how are you?

----

I simply have no internal mapping for this social play.  

I answer in some way (""Fine,"" ""getting along,"" etc.), with no appended question.  Yet they don't even notice and answer anyway, ""Doing good, thanks."""	Implicit

But yes, we should definitely get deranked/losses every time the Ubisoft game/servers fail which is completely not at your fault. That's the logic of Reddit right? According to these down votes I assume that's what the people wants. Seeing as how you guys think, maybe we should get banned for a day every time the Ubisoft servers fail, and you get downranked to bronze. SeemsGood."	Not

I guess that's a reference to the [1920 Rose Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Rose_Bowl)?  In that game the Harvard Crimson defeated the Oregon Webfoots by a score of 7-6."	"I would think so; just checked, there's nothing else it could be if it's a Harvard game. Interesting a) that they don't call it the Rose Bowl  and b) that they say *at Los Angeles*, not *in*. (I've been listening to linguistics audiobooks lately.)

Why would you ever give up Webfoots?"	Not
