What is ""European""? Europe as a concept comes from the very limited worldview of ancient greeks. And even they didn't put weight into it in terms of an identity, as they certainly didn't feel more connected with other ""Europeans"" than they did the Indo-Iranians to the east.

>Races do exist, any ""scholar"" that tries to prove otherwise is just really trying to redefine scientifically proven genetic clusters as ""socially constructed."" (As liberals who can't find jobs outside of academia tend to do.)

The way you phrase this shows that you have no understanding of what they're even saying. Those who say race is a social construct don't deny the fact that there are genetic clusters of people.

>I'm sure there's a name for the logical fallacy of cherry-picking examples to disprove the rule, but I don't know what it is.

How am I cherry picking? Most of the ""nations"" of earth have formed in the last 300 years as a result of colonialism. Either one people had conquered another, resulting in boarders being based on politics as recent as that, or one people had been overlords of another and then drew borders with little regard for those who live there. This is true for almost all countries in the Americas, the Pacific, or Africa, while also being true for quite a few of those in the Middle East, South Asia or Southeast Asia."

R2: Sloane 25D 8CL 15CP 15T 1G vs Hawks

R3: Sloane 31D 8CL 24CP 9T 1G vs Port

Total:

Sloane 80D, 25CL, 52CP, 28T, 2G

Danger 97D, 25CL, 60CP, 17T, 7G

**Discussion:**

Dangerfield is on top for all listed stats other than equal in Clearances after 3 rounds. An arguement can however be made for the quality of opponents. Adelaide faced and beat fellow top 5 opponents in GWS and Port Adelaide, as well as the lowly Hawks. Geelong faced Freo (11th after 6 rounds), North (15th after 6 rounds), and Melbourne (8th after 6 rounds). Note that Geelong only narrowly won vs North.

Dangerfield has the stats, but has accumulated these stats in a team lacking midfield strength and facing lowly opponents. 

Sloane is only slightly behind in stats, and would be considered Elite for all, and has versed much tougher opponents. 

**Verdict:**

Both are good stop fighting.

Customer:  so, ah, and you know I'm just asking for a friend cuz I don't need 'em (nervous laughter) but, ah, those penis enlargement pills...do they work?

Me: I don't think they do.

I do fine simply challenging myself, and spamming my friend with updates on my progress, but otherwise, it all feels a bit silly, (aside from just being a game, lol) when I'm over here rejoicing at GR74 when there are 86s.

The solution to this would not be pretty. Aside from finding some miraculous way to stop all botting, you'd still have to gut the Paragon system, which is in itself rewarding, though obviously giving players an insane advantage. I don't think I could give up paragon myself. Then get rid of Caldesann, which I find cool.
