This male customer got into an argument with the department manager because he SWORE the Russ Trolls were $12.99, and he DEMANDED he be sold one at $12.99. Soon into the argument his wife stormed over to the manager and claimed she saw the TV ad showing the Russ Trolls at $12.99 (nope, we had a copy of the ads in the office).

They got so loud and obnoxious that soon there were what had to have been nearly 20 adults, ALL yelling and demanding the Russ Trolls for $12.99. They actually ran down the doll aisle to grab them before we had the head of security finally restore some semblance of order and told the crowd that he would take their names and phone numbers and give them a call once everything was ""sorted out"".

> however the emergence of a slew late night comedians delving full on into the world of politics with blatant political agendas of their own (Colbert, Samantha Bee, Olvier himself) and hide behind a facade of entertainment is far more insidious.

which is an insane finish after a few rather moot points."	How exactly is this an insane finish? When the sum total of the numbers of viewers and followers of Last Week Tonight alone more than double those of InfoWars, it would seem apparent that Oliver would have just as much sway in the realm of politics as Jones in terms of the average American. It is one thing to shine the light on a news organization founded on conspiracy and outright falsehoods. But he acts as though this fringe element is more dangerous to the general populace despite the fact that Jones clearly presents himself as the head of a media element with a very open agenda. Oliver presents his show as having researched findings (dozens of which distort the truth or fail to tackle an issue from more than one perspective) while peppering these segments with personal attacks and fabrications of his own. This tactic, which can be seen coming from Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, and the like, leads to days of media coverage from official news organizations who extol these programs as though they contain an ounce of journalistic integrity. These same comedians will then boast and proudly declare themselves a line of defense against fake news when they seek to bolster a particular world view, regardless of facts. However, when such criticisms are directed their way, comedians like Oliver will simply claim to be pure entertainers, knowing full well the effects of their shows on the political sphere. The same arguments would hold even if his attacks were directed at CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.	Not

1) Try using a larger/longer wiper blade on the upper wiper arm, so that it wipes the area directly in front of the camera lens.  Depending on how the windshield molding is shaped, you might excessively bend the upper inch or two of wiper blade, so you'll hae to replace it more frequently.

2) Move your camera lens over to the right a couple of inches.  Depending on the specific design/setup of your dash-cam, you might be able to do this by flipping the camera around (left-end on right, right-end on left), or shift the camera as installed a couple of inches.  You should be able to get some additional double-side adhesive install pads from the camera manufacturer website, or from Amazon.

3) Do a combination of #1 and #2."	Not

144		czj8kv8	DarkNetMarketsNoobs		"It seems the general consensus is that PO boxes are smart in your case as it rids any notion of being disrespectful to your parents.  I don't believe it would hold any grounds in the case of a CD as you need to give them your home address to get one in the first place.  That is, unless you use a fake ID, but that could result in you getting charged with fraud.

Make sure to get junk mail or some shit sent their as well, but the paper stuff you're thinking about ordering is generally the safest to order especially if domestic and from a trusted vendor so you'll most likely be fine regardless of decision.  It's just a matter of respect.
