A simple reading could go something like ""to be learned is good ... just don't try to learn or think TOO much ...."" which can easily be abused into a very anti-science mentality which can be quite harmful.

OTOH, we know the church actually does support higher learning and science (just look at the STEM programs at BYU and the research they do, etc.). 

How can people reconcile the conflict between ""keep things simple / don't think too much"" and the need to think and analyze the world around us?"	"I'm not sure where you're getting the ""don't try to learn too much"" from this talk. I didn't sense that reading it. 

Keeping things simple is a pretty important idea that makes a huge difference in my own life. I will never stop learning and studying. I don't see those two as mutually exclusive.

So one day I show up for a romp and we get down and dirty, and after we finish I casually ask ""hey do you have a towel or something i can use to clean up?"" and she tosses me some cloth and I wipe myself off. It wasn't until after that i realized she had given me her husbands pajama pants and i wiped our sexjuices off on his pants.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."	Not

That doesn't seem correct to me, but did anything in the game actually happen?  I know the PoV ceremony was today and that Paul took Jason down, but what made the whole blow up happen?	"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."	Not

36	dkzaj16	dkzy03a	CanadaPolitics	"While this article is generally on-point, I'm going to point out this flaw about our healthcare system:

> Even today, it’s a mishmash by province, and the strains of the system are evident in months- to years-long waits for low-priority treatments such as back surgeries and hip replacements. **Wealthy Canadians can, and do, travel to the United States to receive these treatments.** And they pay for what they get locally, too, in taxes: The nation spends an average of $5,000 per person on health care each year.

I'm tired of hearing this when it's not true. Everyone seems to have a story about their wealthy friend who ran down to Detroit because they were sick of waiting for an MRI, but data just doesn't support the idea that this is an epidemic or anything more than a *very* uncommon occurrence by only the wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians. 

[This widely-cited, peer-reviewed study from 2002](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full) used multiple strategies to evaluate Canadian-to-US healthcare crossings—including contacting hospitals in Washington, Michigan and New York and contacting the 50 best-known and best-ranked hospitals in the United States—and concluded that **""Results from these sources do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States**. Indeed, **the numbers found are so small as to be barely detectible** relative to the use of care by Canadians at home."" [Here's a comprehensive video that cites the study, as well as several other myths about our healthcare system.](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0?t=3m58s)

None of this is to blunt the criticism against Trudeau—he certainly didn't enable our healthcare system to become what it is—but this is a myth that I'm tired of seeing."	How do they obtain personal medical information to come to their conclusions?	Not

Last Podcast on the Left(comedy/horror): these guys discuss all things scary with a bit of comedy mixed in. Their serial killers editions are probably the best.

99		dgyt419	Dashcam		"&gt; 1. Is a dual cam worth it?

Yes, depending upon what you want to do with it.

So there are two types of dash cameras in this generation with parking mode. 1) With excellent parking modes, but only good-fair video quality; 2) With Excellent video quality, but lackluster parking mode.

Excellent parking mode is: Automatically enable/disable (lackluster is very painful in this department), Buffered recording (able to record a few seconds before, and after action detected), low power when in use (only writes to micro SD card when motion activated detected), voltage cut off feature (to protect battery.)

&gt; 2. Is having a parking mode feature worth it?

So is it worth it, well dual cameras definitely [improve parking mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGWGX1t8DU0). Do you back into the spot 100% of the time? Most don't. Even if you do, [you can be hit from behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhIXOxjyko).

Hardwiring is a little more difficult, I actually like GPS (speed/location only not directions), built in Wifi definitely improves your ability to check video, change settings, over a LCD screen. Some of the Parking mode dash cams have Cloud feature (stream anywhere - paid feature) and cellphone notifications of G sensor activation(s) while in park mode (generally free feature.) Some have excellent night mode, like the Thinkware F770 2 CH. 


Others are simply vehicle on dash cams, like the A119 - Excellent video quality day, good night, good shadow, lackluster park mode. You can hardwire this to hide wires, but most hardwire to an outlet that is only powered when the ignition is on.

----

I would say Excellent Park mode worth it, dual cam worth it, wifi worth it, GPS worth it, and being discreet is definately worth it.

In the 70s, cigarettes were a major contributor to starting house fires and congress had asked cigarette manufacturers to develop a self-extinguishing product. Rather than develop said product, they reached into the money bags and lobbied to have flame retardants put into furniture to help mitigate the risk of an unexstinguished cigarette. 

What do you know? Congress took the money and brought in requirements for flame retardant materials to be used in furniture construction. 

The reality - flame retardants have allowed for synthetic materials to become more prevalent in modern furniture. These synthetic materials release higher amounts of toxic smoke that fill a room replacing the oxygen and leading to hotter, and more quickly progressing fires.
