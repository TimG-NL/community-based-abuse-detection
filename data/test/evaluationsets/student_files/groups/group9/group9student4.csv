A simple reading could go something like ""to be learned is good ... just don't try to learn or think TOO much ...."" which can easily be abused into a very anti-science mentality which can be quite harmful.

OTOH, we know the church actually does support higher learning and science (just look at the STEM programs at BYU and the research they do, etc.). 

How can people reconcile the conflict between ""keep things simple / don't think too much"" and the need to think and analyze the world around us?"	"I'm not sure where you're getting the ""don't try to learn too much"" from this talk. I didn't sense that reading it. 

Keeping things simple is a pretty important idea that makes a huge difference in my own life. I will never stop learning and studying. I don't see those two as mutually exclusive.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."	Not

"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."	Not

> Even today, it’s a mishmash by province, and the strains of the system are evident in months- to years-long waits for low-priority treatments such as back surgeries and hip replacements. **Wealthy Canadians can, and do, travel to the United States to receive these treatments.** And they pay for what they get locally, too, in taxes: The nation spends an average of $5,000 per person on health care each year.

I'm tired of hearing this when it's not true. Everyone seems to have a story about their wealthy friend who ran down to Detroit because they were sick of waiting for an MRI, but data just doesn't support the idea that this is an epidemic or anything more than a *very* uncommon occurrence by only the wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians. 

[This widely-cited, peer-reviewed study from 2002](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full) used multiple strategies to evaluate Canadian-to-US healthcare crossings—including contacting hospitals in Washington, Michigan and New York and contacting the 50 best-known and best-ranked hospitals in the United States—and concluded that **""Results from these sources do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States**. Indeed, **the numbers found are so small as to be barely detectible** relative to the use of care by Canadians at home."" [Here's a comprehensive video that cites the study, as well as several other myths about our healthcare system.](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0?t=3m58s)

None of this is to blunt the criticism against Trudeau—he certainly didn't enable our healthcare system to become what it is—but this is a myth that I'm tired of seeing."	How do they obtain personal medical information to come to their conclusions?	Not

Last Podcast on the Left(comedy/horror): these guys discuss all things scary with a bit of comedy mixed in. Their serial killers editions are probably the best.

Majes2 said 
""*Every* reincarnation will increase your base stats and growths, depending on your class mastery, and the total # of levels earned across all live""

Then Laharlsblade said

""Reincarnation in this game is honestly pretty pointless after the first time, since mastering every class and then leveling from 1 to 9999 while in the Elite Four squad will get your unit max stats from leveling up (10 million). Any additional stats you gain from reincarnations will do nothing.""

Trying to make sense of both comments.  Does that mean that reincarnating could increase your states every time you do it, but it is not necessary to do so because there is a cap on leveling your stats which can be reached by only doing 5 reincarnations + Elite four squad?

I guess what I'm trying to say is, how many times am I supposed to reincarnate a single character in order to get him as high as I can?  Is it every time he masters a class, every time he hits 9999, or just however many times it takes to get to 10,000,000 stats?

Thanks all!
"	"In past iterations of Disgaea, reincarnation used to be a big thing. In this one, you max your subclasses on a character and then reincarnate in the Elite Four squad + Raised Flag (for non-monster characters) will net you a base stat total of around 10mil in each stat. 

You _can_ reincarnate more for bonus points, but the bonuses they give you are tiny compared to the bonuses you can get from later gear, especially carnage gear. That's why it's pointless, in a sense, to reincarnate more than once or twice. "	Not

It is true that there are many incredibly unlikely events that happen in our world that would be truly dumbfounding if we ever experienced them. However what many fail to realize is that unlikely events happen *all the time.* This is because there is quite literally an infinite number of cosmic dice rolling going on every second of the day, and when you have infinite chances for an unlikely event to happen, that event will then become incredibly likely to happen *somewhere*. 

[Consider that the chance of an apocalyptic asteroid striking the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event#Frequency_and_risk) any given year is one in 440,000 (.0002%). This is another way of saying that such an asteroid strikes the Earth every 440,000 years. At any given year, the chance remains the same, but what you find if you wait 440,000 years is that the probability of it happening ex post facto becomes 63%. The probability that it will strike continues to rise each passing year. The probability is described as such:

1 - (1 - P)^n

Extrapolate this to any event, such as a person becoming miraculously cured of cancer. What you get is an occasional, mind boggling and seemingly supernatural defiance of probability.

It's not too extreme when you think about it. Yes the animals naturally eat meat but when you buy pet food that isn't meat is it? It's tiny little bread nuggets and lots of dog foods already advertise adding vegetables to the mix. Pet food is made from baby chickens and parts from sick or long dead animals they can't give to people so really it's not the best thing for your pet. The vegan alternatives fortify the food with the nutrients the animals need just like the regular foods do. 

"	"Actually, dogs are not obligate carnivores. They have a mutation (a similar one is found in humans) that lets them digest grains better than their wild relatives. So some vegetables and grains isn't a bad addition to their diet, though I would still recommend  a dogfood low in grains and with meat as the first ingrediant. And even then their teeth, digestive system and nutritional needs are suited for a diet high in meat. They can live on a vegan diet, with the right supplements, but it's not at all what their body is suited for.
Cats absolutely are obligate carnivores, they can not digest plants very well. Even the best vegan catfood is as unnatural and unhealthy for them as a diet of solely meat would be for a rabbit or cow.

As for the stuff the petfood is made of, that depends on what  kind you buy. Some is  as you put it ""bread nuggets"" and made from animals too sick to be legally sold to humans. Some is actually made from decent ingredients. Though for cat food, the unwanted chicks from chicken hatcheries is, if handled properly, probably better and more natural for them than fish based foods, considering cats wild relatives are desert dwelling predators.

Using the bargain-brand crappy petfoods as an example to justify feeding a cat or dog vegan petfood is as unfair as someone using vegan potato chips as  an example to justify never feeding a child fruits or vegetables of any kind. Even with the proper supplements, a diet without any fruits or vegetables isn't natural for humans. (Even the Maasai people, who are famous for living mostly on milk and blood from their cows, do eat  some grains, legumes, and vegetables) And even with the proper supplements, a vegan diet is far from natural for dogs and cats, even if it is an improvement over the garbage sold under some pet food brands.
