47	czgtqcs	czjdqfx	DaystromInstitute	People are not answering the question I posed. I will clarify. When Sisko retook DS9, Dukat was in Federation custody now had the war ended at that point or shortly there after would the other parties convene a trial for Dukat using him as a bargaining chip to force the Dominion to surrender.  Sisko, Martok and Senator Velal could force concessions onto the Dominion by holding a public trial of Cardassia's former leader. My question is not about the outcome of the war rather it is about the methods open to the Alliance in prosecuting the war.	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sh#t about the Cardassians time and time again.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."	Not

Second, watch the getting started videos on iRacings Youtube page. Some of these are out of date a bit, but still helpful nonetheless.

Third, read the sporting code once you become a member. This will cover everything.

&gt; Best deal

There are a few new member deals floating around. A couple are listed over in the sidebar here ---&gt; Not sure if any are still active though.

&gt; how not to anger people as a new driver

Practice a lot before you race and treat people as you would want to be treated. Ill just say that you already have a big leg up on many new drivers in that you understand the simple concept of empathy. Some people just drive like there arent other humans in the other cars.

In terms of practice time, it depends on how skilled you are. Do you have any background at all in sim racing or is iRacing your first venture into this world? Do you have any background in understanding motorsports in general. Do you watch racing? Do you understand racing concepts (drafting, cornering, apex, etc)? If you answered no to any of these questions, you might need to spend more time than others educating yourself. On the other hand If you have plenty of prior experience and knowledge, getting competent wont take too long. Getting fast though takes awhile. For example, I had a long history with sim racing games from the time I was a young kid and it took me close to a year to really get competitive with the fastest guys. iRacing is like nothing else out there.

&gt; how to get set-ups

1. Make your own

2. Some people share theirs on the forum, you can download from there.

83	czis7ps	czj4ztk	InternetIsBeautiful	"My goal with PolitiPlatform was to create a site that made it easy to view and compare the policies of each presidential candidate.

Each candidate on the site has all of their policies listed and categorized. You can also comment and debate each policy by clicking on it and going to the comment section at the bottom of the page.

We also plan to add a feature that allows you to directly compare two candidates by selecting them and then having their policies on certain topics listed side by side.

With the Iowa caucuses coming up tomorrow and dozens more within the next month, I hope the site helps someone before they go to vote.

If so you can do what I do - buy a pack of lunch meat (turkey, beef, salami, pastrami - you name it) and by the time the pack's empty you're bored of that type of meat, so you buy another and just rotate through.	That's exactly what I do - except it's always turkey because my dad buys the groceries...	Not

98	czip4wd	czjbuu0	AskReddit	Poor health. I'm a health researcher, and can say that most people vastly overestimate the degree of influence their personal choices have on their health. Genetics, environmental exposures, and social factors far outweigh the influence of diet and exercise in most chronic conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, depression, etc). Good choices can help you manage these conditions, but they rarely prevent them - and this scares most people shitless.	Muh genetics	Not
99	dkztdwl	dkzvj5y	AskReddit	Can I ask what type of machine you have at home and how much I could expect to pay for the same one? I've always wanted to design and build my own backpacks and there are so many different machines to choose from.	"Yeah! I have had these same two for many years. They are what I use daily, sometimes 6-8 hours in a stretch. They are both Singers. The lightweight is a 20u, which is a zigzag and straight stitch. The heavy duty is a 531b, which is straight stitch only. I believe Consew has a model just like the 531b; i think the singer was actually made by consew. I bought them both used, and just make sure to take them to the machine spa for their tune up regularly. They are FAST, which is why I love them. The lightweight is only light compared to the heavy duty (I call him The Beast) because it can sew through multiple layers of vinyl or canvas. The Beast, I am convinced, would sew through a finger, though I've yet to test that theory. 
It's been a while since I bought them, but if I remember correctly, I paid about $600 for Beast, and maybe $3-600 for The Little One?  I found her on Craigslist, and drove about an hour to pick her up. They are crazy heavy, as the motor is attached to the table, and you just pull the machine head off and take that part to the repair shop. I've had these two for so long, they feel like an extension of my hands :). 

If you have a sewing machine shop anywhere near you, go in and try some out. If you don't, keep an eye on Craigslist and go visit it. Don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't feel like the right machine for you. They are great machines, but I walked away from one because it hadn't been cared for and it wasn't worth the risk to me. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm actually sitting with The Little One right now, working on a quilt at night. Let me know if you have any other questions! "	Not

103	dgyney2	dgyu50z	AskTrumpSupporters	">Aside from that, do you believe the correct punishment for dealing drug is to be killed without a trial?

In a third world country, yes. You can't send these guys to prison and expect them to reform. The prisons are literally pens where people are kept like animals. Drug dealers bribe the guards and police so they can keep liquor, prostitutes, and drugs flowing to their cells before being released at half-term for ""good behavior."" Execution is a totally reasonable punishment when you have no capacity to reform them.

Without a trial? Not so much. Of course in Duterte's case, he didn't have much choice. It's the exception to the rule. "	[removed]	Not

108	czj9fkm	czjahkz	OverwatchHeroConcepts	Does it do any damage? Only one support has fewer hp than what you've listed, the other three have 200 atm, probably a missight. I'm very often against cd manipulation, it can do unpredictable things some times. But this is very aware of those concerns, while not fully addressing them it does try to limit them, that said maybe a little focus fired	"It's not really meant to do much damage, it's meant to give damage with Distorted Bolt and Recall to allies while helping them survive. If you're asking how much damage it does, Distorted Blast does 15 damage and that's it. Should I add damage to Lost Time?

I did misremember the HP of most supports, I thought most of them were 150 HP. I'll bump it up to 220 HP. Thanks for the feedback."	Not

131	czij89v	czj9iz6	AskReddit	"I'm from Pakistan and while we hire help, we also do most chores ourselves. The people who don't do anything at home in our family are men. I really can't stand people who think home chores are for poor people or women, but what I hate the most are the people who don't even treat the help like people. Like not even their own help, I have had guests who were like ""why is the servant sitting at your dinner table?"". Maybe it's because we grew up poor and then moved to the city, but I can't stand people who can't live without a servant or a mother."	When I lived in the middle east I noticed locks on all the kitchen cabinets, the refrigerator, the closets, etc. I learned that this was because hired cooks and cleaners (which was the norm there) were notorious for stealing. Oh yes, and for receiving a subhuman wage. Also, most doors could be locked from the outside. My husband once went down to tell the staff at the hotel (our first month we lived in a hotel) that the lock was broken and the workers didn't quite understand his English. They thought he was asking them to lock me IN.	Not

133	dgyx9qq	dgyxhpg	ChineseLanguage	Well - I would use as much dictation as possible , considering you will have no choice but to go for listening-only material. Without dictation, I can see you missing a lot of grammar patterns which are easily exposed through reading. A combination of textbook dialogs, free intermediate material (like Slow Chinese), and random stuff like radio/TV shows is probably going to be your best bet for now.	That's a good idea.  I've been thinking about adding more dictation to my study routine.	Not

Not really, with Florida its mostly because city dwellers from other states flock to cities like Miami which are pretty and modern and warm year round.

Battery cutoff is 3.2 volts. He4 can handle 25amps, 20amps recommended. 3 batteries in series means total voltage at cutoff is 9.6v

20amps*9.6volts=192 watts.

Keep it under 192 watts and your batteries are safe.

Edit* add in chipset efficiency of a generous 90% and you're at a cap of 172 watts on those batteries to for sure be in the safe zone."	Awesome thanks for the info!	Not

143		dgyvws5	Monitors		The Zowie XL2411 (not XL2411Z) is fine (aside from usually being significantly overpriced) once switched from the FPS mode to the Standard mode and is significantly better than the rest, especially since it is PWM/Flicker Free unlike the GN246HL/VG248QE/242G5DJEB.  The XL2411Z has horrible image quality regardless of which settings are used, and both the G2406PF+MG248QE have very washed out colors @144hz, but are still somewhat accurate, and are PWM/Flicker Free.
