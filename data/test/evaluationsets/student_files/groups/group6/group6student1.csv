I've routinely seen individuals with no major scientific background, including humanities and engineering students score extremely high.

As a matter of fact, a significant % of the highest scorers in our schools MCAT club is encompassed by the aforementioned cohort.

At the end of the day, how you score relies almost exclusively on your critical thinking capabilities and mental processing speed."

"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."	Not
22		WeAreTheMusicMakers	czj9shy		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "	Not

I'm sorry you're angry, but what does it matter what I, a woman who has seen many more years, think about you? For the record you seem like an incredibly bright person who has great potential to do some real good in this world. So then, what is missing?

Fair enough!

> I find myself throwing the Daredevil and Hyroad the most, and I love both of those pieces.

Cool. Both of those look great (I own a HyRoad, and have considered adding a DD to my setup also), so no objection there. Opens the path to dropping the !QTF also.

> So just for confusion sake. I'm likely going to pull the !QTF out of my bags and buy a DDTrick or GB2.

thumbsup.jpg

> I don't have much info on either, so is there one you would recommend over the other?

Given that you have a mostly Storm/RG bag (and more importantly a Dare Devil already), I'd lean towards the DDTrick (bigger cover, same core) for that reason. GB2 should be similar just a board or two less overall hook vs the DDTrick.

> And if I decide I want to bowl more tournaments I should pick up a monster hook ball.

Agreed.

> Can you also recommend an Asym monster to pick up?

The Mako and Sure Lock are pretty much leading the field right now for the asym hook monster slot. The new No Rules Exist from RG could also be good, but haven't seen enough from that ball to have as strong of an opinion on it. I personally have a Sure Lock for that slot and love it."	Just to butt in, Sure Lock then ball down to DDT seems like a great combo, granted I've had the DDT for just a week.	Not
62	dkz2oay	TheMassive	dkzubj6	"Ok, so I keep seeing this sentiment (in this thread and others) that being annoyed with our current standing and our performance this year is silly and foolish.

Can someone tell me how fighting for a playoff spot over midway through the season in Berhalters highest PPG year ever is a good thing? No?

So can we stop acting like thats a good thing? The sky's not falling. Its also not raining Supporter's Shields and MLS Cups, and its ok to want that. Stop insulting and putting down fans who are frustrated with mediocrity when this season is exactly that. People see teams like Chicago and TFC who have been historically terrible at the top of the table, and they want the Crew to be there. But fuck them right?

I don't want to hear about point totals unless you can look me in the eye and tell me that 6th in the east (out of 11 teams, so right in the middle) is a *good* team and we should be happy to be in this position. Wanting an above average team instead of average ISN'T A BAD THING, so stop treating fans who want and expect that like they're bad fans."	This. 👏	Not

134	czj5n6e	AnimeFigures	czj6hwp	Aye it is and their statues are really great, speaking of which, have you seen the Naruto and Sasuke statues for Naruto Storm 4 that Tsume made in collaboration with Bandai Namco? Gecco has 1 exclusive Naruto figurine which is when he puts on Minato's Hokage coat from Road to Ninja, the other one comes with interchangeable parts for 3 different poses and they are supposedly making Kakashi next with interchangeable parts as well :) are you hunting down all the Tsume Xtra's or just getting Obito and Itachi?	Yes! I saw it. Pricing is a little steep, but I'm keeping my eye out. I'm slowly collecting the Tsume XTras one by one. I have Orochimaru preordered.	Not
135		worldwonders	dgyv4as		"In March 1958, a B-47 bomber took off from Hunter Air Force Base near Savannah, Georgia destined for the UK to take part in a training exercise. While in flight a warning light indicated that the bomb, called an Mk 6, wasn’t secured properly so a crewmen went to check on it. While he was inspecting he accidentally grabbed the release hatch lever instead of a hand-grip to pull himself up. This sent the 8,500-lb. device crashing into the bomb bay doors, forcing them open and plummeting the bomb 15,000 feet below. Fortunately, the nuclear head for the bomb was in a separate location and the bomb was not armed. The bomb detonated on impact, leaving a 75-foot across, 35-foot-deep crater. It destroyed the home and property of the Gregg family of Mars Bluff, South Carolina. The family of six was injured but there was no reported fatalities.
