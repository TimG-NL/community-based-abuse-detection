9	dgy2l8u	dgyu8ei	AskAnAmerican	Go into more detail, please. I know it's anecdotal, but I don't run across people with anecdotal experience of two systems very often.	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."	Not

No random Indian who has never spoken to you is so enthralled with your charm as to give you free food all the time.

17		dgytefr	Vive		"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."	Not

My gripes with this card is that it's really not that much better than any other combo card. Offensively, it's for most parts the same as any 0 cost 5k combo. 

Let's say you attack a 10k with another 10k and you play this bumping up your card to 16k. If they commit 5k, you win, but you would've already won the tie if you had just put down a 5k. To beat you they need to put down a 10k, which is the immediate next level, which also has the same result as a 5k combo.

The only utility this card has outside of instances of battle cards not having powers divisible by 5k is defensively. And that's pretty weird for a red card too. Only defensively does this card act like a 0 cost 10k. I mean, that's kind of neat, but I'd think any 0 cost 5k Battle card would be useful more often.

76		czjgh1z	ShinyPokemon		I think... it might be because you had such high expectations for this method. 800 eggs are a lot compared to some successful hunts on here but it's not even that bad.

Eyeshadow. Yes it looks pretty, yes it would be a nice color for me, but now often will I use it?

Lip balm. It's always the same thing; I lose it, buy another one, and then I find the one that I lost. I do the same thing with USB cables.

Chica & Chico Beta-Salic. Didn't do anything for me. I purchased it as part of a set so it isn't a total loss though. The Astazet is wonderful.

Pore strips. Just no. Whyyy did I ever think they were a good idea.

Any sort of peel off or modeling mask. I just can't stand how they feel on my face."	"&gt; Lip balm. It's always the same thing; I lose it, buy another one, and then I find the one that I lost. I do the same thing with USB cables.

For both lip balms and usb cables, I used to  have the same issue. Now I keep one in my work bag, one in my purse, one on my night stand, one on my desk. And I leave them there. Since I've stopped moving them around, I no longer lose them and I always have one when I need it."	Not

80	czjfm3o	czjg8so	TrueReddit	The recent brinkmanship and lack of compromise do not necessarily come from a two-party system, however. They are due to the separation of power, specifically between the executive and the legislative branch in the United States. If we have a two party system, but the party in power can have total control over policy making, then there is no brinkmanship and obstructionism.	Remember those two years from 2009-2011 when there was a democrat in the white house, democrats in congress, and democrats in the senate, and the affordable care act barely passed even with many concessions to the republicans?

94	czj1e6v	czj4za3	BabyBumps	I had two miscarriages before my son was born a few weeks ago and I really struggled with anxiety at the beginning of the second and third pregnancies. People mean well by encouraging you to think positively and to avoid worrying, but it's also okay if you can't. Our thoughts alone don't make things happen -- and they certainly don't end pregnancies. Pregnancies often end because something has gone wrong early in the deeply complex process of building a new person. Miscarriage is a tremendously sad experience, but it's not the result of worry or anxiety or stress. Those things aren't _good_ for you, but lots of healthy babies are born to lots of anxious moms (myself included). Releasing yourself from that pressure to not worry might actually make you worry less...at least that was my experience. Wishing you the best!	"Thank you. This and a previous comment saying something similar has helped. I can just hope for the best and try again if it doesn't work. I read a quote a couple of days ago, ""Not being happy or excited now isn't going to save you from what might happen."" "	Not

98	dgvsxof	dgyujz2	MkeBucks	I defended him all year but the last few weeks has been tough. He needs to play with Giannis and not in place of Giannis like he did the majority of the season. Kidd played them together late in the season but it still didn't work out (I think his shot was busted by then). Defenses still respect him though and having him on the court actually helped spacing because he was never afraid to shoot. I think some team desperate for spacing might convince themselves that they can help him get back to his just-sub .40 shooting.	Yep to all of that.	Not
99	czjcdia	czjcj11	AMA	What got you in the situation you're in now?	Laziness and being a wuss for not switching colleges.	Not
100	dkzqp12	dkzqun5	FireEmblemHeroes	You could always give him TA/raven tome. The extra defense combined with the damage reduction from TA and Raven means that he can sort of tank colorless and green. Either that or keep his default tome (which is great for supporting), give him a rally and maybe a different C skill (Hone, Fortify, Drive Attack, etc.) and he turns into a decent team buffer/support.	Maybe I will look into it when my other units have their builds finished. With the switched rates I'll maybe finally pull a Roy.	Not
101	czif5oi	czjei0t	DestinyTheGame	[verwijderd]	"I'm not really worried about my k\d. It won't change anything in game. It's just a shitty game mode for something like IB where you need to play a lot to get great drops.

I completely agree with you though, it needs to be clash so its not so fireteam oriented."	Not
102		dkzor0j	KSU		As accurately as I can remember, we usually get our refunds around the beginning to middle of September. Not everyone gets theirs at the same time, but you should get it before the end of September at the latest. If you have questions or concerns I suggest you contact the bursary office since hey handle most of the financial aspects of the school.	Not
103	dgyywzz	dgz26ew	Rainbow6	"The basic design of Siege, where most engagements are within 10 meters, makes Glaz less viable. That being said, he wasn't completely worthless. He was still decent on some maps, such as Plane and Favela. We did see him occasionally used in pro league for certain strats, though he was pretty much a ranked only operator.

That's fine. The concept of Glaz inherently doesn't mesh well with Siege. Just make him fun for ranked, and he was good (which they did in 5.2). Instead, they tried to make him viable in pro league, and just made him this destructive monster.

"	I personally think that Glaz i balanced now. It's not like you see him in every single game, or at least not on ps4. If i'm in objective room and know they have a Glaz and start smoking the room I move to flank him even if i'm not a roamer.	Not
104		dkzo0iu	AskReddit		Hello-Adele. Because I can belt it out.	Not
105	czjbwi7	czjccst	MakingaMurderer	"Right. Bobby says he woke up around 2:30 pm, goes to the window, sees Teresa...goes hunting...comes home around 5:00 pm (around the time Scott arrived at Barb's). 




* Trial: Bobby doesn't see anything burning in the barrel at 5 pm when he got home from hunting.
* Trial: Scot doesn't see anything at 5:15 pm when he picks up Barb.
* Trial: Fabian says around 5:20 pm fire/smoke in the barrel
* Trial: Blaine says when got off the school bus at 3:45ish: "" I seen Steven Avery bringing a plastic bag to the burning barrel.""
* Trial: Gets home at 11 pm (the interview with police he was hone 9:30 pm-10 pm and saw nothing) says: ""I seen Steven Avery sitting there watching the fire.""
* Trial: Blaine is not asked if he saw a fire at 5:25-5:30 pm when he left to go trick or treating.


Summary from the trial - first police interviews do not match up:


* 3:45 pm: Blaine only person to see burn barrel/fire/smoke/Steven putting plastic bag in barrel.

* 5:00 pm-5:30 pm: only Fabian claims to have seen a fire in the barrel and that it smelled like plastic.

* 7:15 pm: Only Scott claims to have seen a fire in the pit.

* 11:00 pm: Only Blaine claims to have seen a fire in the pit.

* 3:45 pm: Blaine, Brendan, possibly Bobby were home.
* 5:15 pm: Blaine, Brendan, Barb, Bobby were home (none saw a fire or burning barrel).
* 5:20 pm: fabian and Earl were at Steve's (outside)
* 7:15  pm  Barb, Brendan, Bobby were home.
* 9:00  pm: Brendan and Bobby were home, possibly Barb.
* 10:00 pm: Brendan was home, possibly Blaine, possibly Barb.
* 11:00 pm: Brendan and Bobby were home.

If I've missed something or got a time wrong, please add.
"	Excellent summary. Thank you so much. Should I copy/paste it to the original post?	Not
106	czil9yb	czj8bfs	AskReddit	"I work in a comic shop and had a customer that got the name of a book wrong all the time.  The book was called ""Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose"".  TAROT, like tarot cards (TAIR-OH).  Every month he'd ask for his issue of TOKE-RAH.  I'd pronounce it the proper way, every time.... and everytime he came back he'd ask for TOKE-RAH.  

How the hell do you get a hard K sound from a word with no K (or C) in it?"	"But in the English language it is pronounced ""Tar-oh"".  
Don't get me wrong I know that many people do say it like you, but it isn't meant to be, think it's more about accents maybe?

107	czit0o3	czj4gvb	AskMenOver30	"> The problem is not that you're ""not hot enough"".

The thing is, I've observed that my hotter female friends don't seem to have this sort of problem nearly as often. Guys generally are pretty straightforward in pursuing them if they think they have a chance."	"I really don't want to sound like some red pill creep, but there *is* a lot of game-playing that happens when we meet potential future romantic partners. *Maybe* your friends are hotter (but, for real, probably not), but it's likely they're just better at sending all those signals that tell a person, ""yeah, I might wanna fuck.""

It's true that some of those signals involve appearance--think clothes and makeup--so there's a relationship between successful signal-sending and attractiveness, but not really *innate* attractiveness. I have enough friends of both genders to know that beauty isn't the same thing as flirting skills, and the latter is what gets people dates. 

I'm not trying to start a fight here; I'm rooting for you! As some stranger on the internet, I know I can't change the way that you feel about your appearance. Maybe I *can* help convince you that a different approach could be more successful. 

Go get 'em! "	Not

109	czj8z2e	czjc1bk	LabVIEW	I think we're going to have to do overlay in real-time. We're going to need GPS data and other real time data, it might be too cumbersome to do in post processing. We'll probably just have to build a PC to spec.	"Might be worth trying to write it into a file with an index of the frame number - that way you're not doing image manipulation - just storing it - but still get all of the data. 

You could also do it in real-time on your PC - but you'll just need more resources to do so (RAM especially).

Edited to add some information. 

I did not contract any diseases. The strip club was called Sundowners and was on Lundy's Lane in Niagara falls Ontario. Nothing was discussed beforehand. I got on stage to tip her, which you're allowed to do and had a dollar in between my tits. She grabbed the dollar and lifted my shirt. They always went by body language to see what was ok. She went up my skirt, pulled my thong to the side and licked for a minute tops. The crowd cheered and people were throwing cash at her, I didn't take any of it because it wasn't mine. After I got off the stage I was handed drinks, drink chips and cash throughout the night. 

I may have been a bit drunk by the end of the night. If you ever get the chance to visit one of these clubs, they are awesome.
