9	dgy2l8u	dgyu8ei	AskAnAmerican	Go into more detail, please. I know it's anecdotal, but I don't run across people with anecdotal experience of two systems very often.	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."	Not

17		dgytefr	Vive		"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."	Not

Anyways, I was going to school for economics and pre-law, and once I graduated I took up electrical work with my father and opted out of law school. Best thing that's ever happened to me, but it's hard work, sometimes working with scum people, but the pay is great, and the fact you can work with tools and big equipment all day is awesome. The only things I don't enjoy is being on-call, my hands hurting after work, and the fact that I never know what time I'm going to get home. We work in a very specialized field, so don't take my experience as the majority.

As an electrician, or any trade for that matter, you will never starve; as in no matter where you go, if you do good work there is always a larger demand for work than the supply of skilled electricians/plumbers/roofers etc. 

Don't let the white-collar people fool you...my dad paid for my sister and I's college by running an electrical contracting company. We make better money than a good amount of the office jockeys, but they will always say the contrary.


I would suggest going to school for Construction Management also, while working with a general contracting company doing every trade you can get your hands on. Or specialize in one thing like electric/hvac/plumbing and get out of school and get real work experience.

I was well aware that I was not seeing his entire testimony. However, reading his full testimony, I was struck by the fact that he never actually gives an explanation: 

&gt;Q. Investigator Wiegert, did he give you the license plate number for Teresa Halbach when he called you?

&gt;A. I don't remember the entire content of our conversation but, obviously, he must have because I was asking the dispatcher to run the plate for me.

&gt;Q. Did you not trust that Investigator Wiegert got the number right?

&gt;A. I don't -- That's just the way I would have done it. I don't -- It's not a trust or distrust issue.

This is not actually an explanation. If he says at some point that he was verifying information about the case, I haven't been able to locate that statement. Later on redirect, Kratz assigns Colborn this explanation, which Colborn accepts:

&gt;Q. Mr. Strang asked whether or not it was common for you to check up on other agencies, or perhaps I'm -- I'm misphrasing that, but when you are assisting another agency, do you commonly verify information that's provided by another agency?

&gt;A. All the time. I'm just trying to get -- you know, a lot of times when you are driving a car, you can't stop and take notes, so I'm trying to get things in my head. And by calling the dispatch center and running that plate again, it got it in my head who that vehicle belonged to and what type of vehicle that plate is associated with.

He's not talking specifically about this case, he's giving a general explanation of scenarios in which he might call to verify a plate number. In the Halbach case, he'd clearly gotten enough information that he immediately went to follow up on a lead by interviewing Avery. I'm stumped as to how or why he'd have written down Teresa's license plate number separately from the other info about the case he'd have needed to question Steven Avery."	Not

93		dkzq3cm	ShouldIbuythisgame		"**Earthlock: Festival of Magic** is a chill RPG that's pretty breezy.

**Siralim &amp; Siralim 2** are monster capture games that you can pretty much play indefinitely. They're relaxing games that be focused on or played while winding down for the evening/netflix. The games aren't linked, so you can play either. Siralim 2 has a much more focused narrative and progression system. Siralim 1 is basically ""here are the mechanics, do whatever.""

**Stardew Valley** has been mentioned before, but this game is love. If you haven't played it you should at least check it out. It's similar to Harvest Moon/Rune Factory, though very much a western game.

**Bastion** was great fun and pretty chill. It's kinda action-y, but I didn't struggle with it despite having shitty reflexes. It also has a very soothing narration and ambiance.

**Shadowrun Returns (Original, Dragonfall, Hong Kong)** isn't a difficult game, and it's got an amazing cyberpunk atmosphere. The games are turn based and not particularly hard if you play them on the lower difficulties. The lose condition (you died) just means that you have to restart a mission, and none of your companions die permanently. 

**FEZ** is a charming platformer/puzzler that just oozes style. It's great fun and I definitely recommend it (though it's creator is a real dickhead).

**Decromancer** is a card battle game with an interesting world and a fun premise. The gameplay is really enjoyable if you're into card battles (more like strategic combat, really). No lose condition- failing a battle just means retreating and healing up.

**The Sims 3** is my favorite of the franchise, and you can pick up the expansions really cheap as they go on sale frequently. If you've never played it, I recommend it. You just sort  of dick around with your family of sims and play through a life simulator. None of the expansions are necessary, though I find Ambitions adds the most without changing the way the game plays.

94		czjecvf	FinalFantasy		"Mighty Guard is a must.

If you want to farm early ability points before you get to the final dungeon, Level 5 Death will also be very nice.

White Wind is useful.

But definitely make Mighty Guard a priority, it's easily one of the best spells in the game.

---

When I meant farming, here is a video of the spot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-l0R16u-YU

This is when you get to Castle Bal, a little after you get the Ranger class.  Most people like to max out Rangers because they provide the ability to attack 4 times (8 if dual wielding which I believe was a Ninja ability).  So freelancer with Dual Wield == massive damage (also pretty cheap, avoid this method.  It completely removes the fun out of some fights.)

Late game prior to Neo Exdeath in the final dungeon, you'll fight Movers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdX9xv8V6CA

The title says rare mob, but quicksaving causes them to be the second mob spawn.  This is your late game Abp farm, but it has nothing to do with Blue Magic.

TL;DR:

Mighty Guard

White Wind

Level 5 Death (if you want to max some jobs out early.)"	Not

100	dgyxich	dgyynkv	MortalKombat	"I went off on a tangent there eh? That was a long ass post I wrote. But yeah I was just explaining my thought process on the whole situation of Mileena's character in this timeline VS the original one.

I might have divulged in fanfiction territory with me talking about how Mileena would ditch Outworld for Earthrealm (had a story in mind when I wrote that) but it was an idea I had should she make the transition to good. The idea being that Mileena wants nothing to do with Outworld (or being Empress) and wants to start a new life in Earthrealm. Of course that would involve Mileena's character undergoing a significant transition and would have to be explained by Raiden telling Mileena what Shao Kahn really saw her as. Fanfiction territory, I know lol. Still would love for that to happen though.

But yeah I agree with you on the Kitana/Mileena feud needing a revamp in this timeline. If the previous timeline had Mileena jealous of Kitana being treated better than her by Shao Kahn and her status of Princess of Edenia and all that stuff, I think it should be flipped around with Kitana being jealous of Mileena's newfound humanity (should she ever become good) now that she's damned in the Netherealm and Mileena is living a new, peaceful life in Earthrealm. There can also be an element to the feud where Kitana see's Mileena as a lesser version of herself that doesn't deserve to live. She would also hate that Raiden took pity on her resurrecting her when she tried to have her killed before so in a sense that would sort of mirror their previous feud where Mileena was jealous of Kahn's preferred treatment of Kitana. Basically it's the perfect role reversal that adds a completely new layer to MK's greatest rivalry.

And there I go again on another tangent lol."	"Haha no worries, man. It's all good. I could shoot the shit about Mileena and MK all day.

Yeah, maybe that idea is a little fanfiction-esque, but it would certainly be a story with a unique twist on Mileena's character. 

I do think the idea of ""flipping"" the Mileena/Kitana rivalry is an interesting concept, i.e., Kitana being envious of Mileena while Mileena is enjoying success either in Earthrealm, or ruling Outworld, or whatever; while Kitana is stuck as a revenant in Netherrealm. A role reversal indeed."	Not

120	dgyzsdz	dgz0rwp	CapitalismVSocialism	"> and where does this money come from? the surplus value of workers. 

The savings of workers becomes invested. Share value comes from profits, which you can call surplus value if you want to, nonetheless, workers do not earn more money when they enter into arrangements where there is no surplus value being generated, so it is immaterial to them. It is the best arrangement for them, quite obviously, if all other attempted arrangements have not produced as much wealth for them.

And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

> workers do not get their wages from stock prices, they get them from a portion of the value they create for the company. 

You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

> your making it sound as though the workers don't make money for the company, but the capitalists somehow do, even though the capitalists get this money by stealing it from workers like a parasite.

Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

What good is your concept of exploitation if you cannot create a business structure or the like that actually pays workers more. It's worthless, and employees know this.

> 
> 

"	"&gt;It is the best arrangement for them, quite obviously, if all other attempted arrangements have not produced as much wealth for them.

yet this has not been the case. when catalonia was managed by the anarcho-syndicalist CNT, workers got much better conditions from being able to actually decide them. please stop spouting ahistorical garbage.

&gt;And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

materials mined and collected BY WORKERS, machines built, shipped and used BY WORKERS, in factories and establishments built BY WORKERS. the only relation the capitalist has in this relation is control of capital, they contribute nothing to the actual production of material goods or buildings, and make money by leeching off of their work like parasites.
&gt;You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

this is in itself irrelevant to my response, and also bullshit. this money goes into wallstreet and doesn't come out. besides, anything invested in wall street came out of the labour of workers, and belongs to the workers, not the capitalists, who contributed nothing. they have no reason to be alienated from their own profits

&gt;Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

contracts mean nothing if the alternative is starvation, and alternatives don't matter if they are all equally shit. coops may not pay higher-up employees as much, but i can tell you that someone working in a coop earns much more than someone working in a sweatshop. coops also ensure better job security for the workers, as they are far less likely to fail. where did you get 14% from, breitbart?"

Most people who use cracks use them primarily because they simply have no means of  affording them due to their national socioeconomic situation, but we've given back in the form of recommendations, videos, reviews, word of mouth to friends, providing, admittedly, a minute but constant and diversified local exposure for the product and those who are able to afford it are perhaps persuaded sometimes to acquire it. 

I'm not trying to say piracy actually helps companies sell their games but, analyzing figures and statistics, it doesn't hurt them nearly as bad as they claim and, in many ways, provide, if nothing else, at least a discernible and reliable form of local advertising.

With my medication abortion pills it was $600 all inclusive with pre op and post op care including ultrasounds. I actually need to correct my previous post. My actual medical procedure at PP was vacuum aspiration, not a D &amp; C. The procedure itself took less than 5 minutes in stirrups similar to a Pap smear. All together that procedure took about 5 hours with consent, pre op, Valium distribution, procedure, then 1 hour post op monitoring. Medication abortion took about 3. You take one pill in office then 2 at home the next day and you bleed heavily for a couple of days, including expelling the fetus. The surgical method was easier and bled less, but more invasive and gave me more anxiety than just medications and experiencing a very heavy period for a couple of days followed by bleeding for about another week or so.
