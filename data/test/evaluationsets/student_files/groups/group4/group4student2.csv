The past 30 days has seen the Euro (Finlands currency) weaken from about 1.13201EUR:1USD to it's current 1.18433EUR:1USD This is not quite 5%, but still fairly significant.

Currently NOK is at 5.38 Euro, which would be 6.39 USD. On US exchange, $NOK ADR is $5.36. This is within 1% of the exchange rate. 

If you overlay the NYSE and the HEL charts, around june 30th the NYSE ADR appears to be doing better. That is because from the period of June 26th to the 30th, the Euro weakened considerably vs the USD ~1.8%

In addition to currency exchange rates, the discrepancies in the highs and lows can be explained by the timing of news releases. Generally the Helsinki exchange and the NYSE track each other within a few percent, but Nokia releases many PR and their earnings reports after market close in Helsinki, which is premarket in the US. United states then gets the pops which level off by the time Helsinki market opens.

There is also most likely a difference in perception of the company between European and American investors to take in to account.

I disagree. Knowing that the studios are driven to seek the highest return for their film means they'll constantly be searching for corners to cut. VFX has been one of those corners for a long time, and the fact that there hasn't been union representation has helped that. Establishing union agreements for the industry will change that.

This seems like the most important point. Games just rarely go that late anymore (assuming average to high MMR games).

That said, it doesn't impact me too much, unlike the removal of FotMâ€”with right masteries, you used to be able to get 40+ regen by stacking health regen tank items (FotM + SV + Guardian's Hammer), all for just 6k in gold, and can conditionally bypass Warmog's in favor of other items that are more useful in team fighting.

I am _really_ curious how the midseason update next week is going to affect the tank and bruiser builds, though, especially with the addition of those two superb tank items (Adaptive Helm for anti-skill and DoT spamming mages, and Gargoyle for multi-man resistance gains). For one, I expect the likes of Cass and Teemo to see some drop in win rate over the next few weeks."	"I think a big reason for me is on most AD tanks/bruisers i can usually utilize regen. If there's a few enemy AP's i can build visage and titan hydra. Lots of ap add banshee's. 

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of?

(1) Many economists tie the 2008 recession directly to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.  The lack of separation between commercial and investment banks is likely tied heavily with the Recession. Things along these lines are difficult to prove though, as are many things economically.

(2) I, individually, don't have the right to limit power. But, as an American, I support and elect the people in the government. And the government does have the power to tax and limit power.  A tax on the richest of us (read: Wall Street) can be used beneficially to help the poorest of us. Robin Hood took from the rich to give to the poor. And the average person doesn't care about the globally economy of they're still dirt poor. And, because of income inequality, they're getting poorer, while the rich are getting richer. A Robin Hood tax could alleviate the wealth gap slightly.

(3) The fact that the media is owned by so few large corporations. The fact that in many areas you only have one choice for cable providers. I could go down the list. Monopolies exist. Many monopoly laws aren't being enforced. I don't need to create new monopoly laws.

(4) Yet, somehow, politicians still get paid tons of money from corporate donors. Look how many politicians on both sides of the isle are in bed with certain industries.

(5) Profits not being spent on improving the company should be taxed. They're doing no good and not helping the economy by sitting there. Do you really think that Exxon needs as big of a profit as it does?  Money should be put to use improving society, not locked away where no one can touch it.

(6) People do store their money in places like the Cayman Islands all the time. People, using creative tax ""loopholes,"" find ways to avoid paying taxes on their money by keeping it overseas. That needs to be stopped.

You don't have to agree with me. And, as I said, it's possible not all my ideas would work. I'm not an economist or an expert on the subject.

Now, rather than saying you disagree with my philosophy (it's clear that you have a more libertarian economic philosophy, which I don't agree with for a variety of reasons), why don't you say what you believe should be done to eliminate income inequality.

I don't like having to jump through hoops when I call into other places.

We don't like asking the basic questions much either because it gets repetitive but a large portion of cases get resolved with those questions and that why we ask them up front. I have had numerous calls where I was told but didn't verify a cert is valid or a port is open and  then proceeded to sit on the call for 3 hours until we went back and checked what I should've done initially. 

I understand your frustration as I see it on a smaller scale when calling into my phone provider and get asked 15 things that I have already tested. 

It sounds like a CRM that would cross reference callers with their certificates could be beneficial so the support reps can have a better idea of the expertise that they are dealing with. This could already be in place but I am just unaware. I will look into it and,  if I can't find it,  I will bubble up the idea through management.

Many of his songs feature aggressive lyrics and yelling. This is unusual in the mainstream hip hop genre and appeals to some of the more aggressive types.

He was punched on stage by a Rob Stone supporter (the guy who made Chill Bill) and consequently set off a rivalry.

His most popular song, ""Look at Me"", has an extremely. similar flow to an unreleased Drake song, nicknamed ""KMT"". If you want to look up a side by side comparison, they are in fact very similar. Xxxtentacion called out drake for this alleged copying. 

ASAP Rocky shouted out him on social media I believe, which gained him a huge chunk of attention.

During his time at prison, where he was charged with assaulting a pregnant woman, (a charge which he denies heavily and there is no concrete evidence for) he heavily increased his cult following and people were saying ""free X"", most notably Lil Uzi Vert.

I listen to him and went to his concert, his music is kinda fun if you're a fan of the loud angrier type stuff. However he does put out slower songs, more so before jail, and other songs like Riot which have a different style overall; if you're into that.

It's certainly true that some atheists need to follow this advice, having based their rejection of Christianity on scientific results. (I recall one time being broadly rebuked in an atheist forum when I suggested that the theory of evolution might eventually be replaced by a better theory.) 

Some other atheists, however, reject Christianity on its own (lack of) merits, science being irrelevant. I'm a former Christian in this category, who after a long struggle had to give up on Christianity because its internal workings simply did not make a bit of sense. I couldn't tell what I was supposed to believe.
