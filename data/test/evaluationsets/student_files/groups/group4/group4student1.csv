The past 30 days has seen the Euro (Finlands currency) weaken from about 1.13201EUR:1USD to it's current 1.18433EUR:1USD This is not quite 5%, but still fairly significant.

Currently NOK is at 5.38 Euro, which would be 6.39 USD. On US exchange, $NOK ADR is $5.36. This is within 1% of the exchange rate. 

If you overlay the NYSE and the HEL charts, around june 30th the NYSE ADR appears to be doing better. That is because from the period of June 26th to the 30th, the Euro weakened considerably vs the USD ~1.8%

In addition to currency exchange rates, the discrepancies in the highs and lows can be explained by the timing of news releases. Generally the Helsinki exchange and the NYSE track each other within a few percent, but Nokia releases many PR and their earnings reports after market close in Helsinki, which is premarket in the US. United states then gets the pops which level off by the time Helsinki market opens.

There is also most likely a difference in perception of the company between European and American investors to take in to account.

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it.

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

I disagree. Knowing that the studios are driven to seek the highest return for their film means they'll constantly be searching for corners to cut. VFX has been one of those corners for a long time, and the fact that there hasn't been union representation has helped that. Establishing union agreements for the industry will change that.

This seems like the most important point. Games just rarely go that late anymore (assuming average to high MMR games).

That said, it doesn't impact me too much, unlike the removal of FotMâ€”with right masteries, you used to be able to get 40+ regen by stacking health regen tank items (FotM + SV + Guardian's Hammer), all for just 6k in gold, and can conditionally bypass Warmog's in favor of other items that are more useful in team fighting.

I am _really_ curious how the midseason update next week is going to affect the tank and bruiser builds, though, especially with the addition of those two superb tank items (Adaptive Helm for anti-skill and DoT spamming mages, and Gargoyle for multi-man resistance gains). For one, I expect the likes of Cass and Teemo to see some drop in win rate over the next few weeks."	"I think a big reason for me is on most AD tanks/bruisers i can usually utilize regen. If there's a few enemy AP's i can build visage and titan hydra. Lots of ap add banshee's. 

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of?

Since then however, those with a qualifying pension can elect to split their pension (for income tax purposes) and thus reduce the couple's income tax. A more direct and sure way of evening out a couple's income.

It's the downstream O2, and once the car is in closed loop, and the sensors are warmed up (which happens pretty quick) it responds perfectly to WOT, about 2-3 seconds of WOT, and the sensor goes rich, off the throttle couple seconds in, on decel fuel cut, sensor goes lean, just as you'd expect.

**Author**:  _LDN66_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;Was given a physical coin a couple of years ago.  Didn't think much about it just planned on saving for a rainy day as I liked the idea of BTC even though I didn't really understand much of the tech.  Checked value a couple of weeks ago and surprised to see it's value go up so quickly hence I want to check its all legit.  The company/startup went bankrupt (seemed a bit shady when it closed with people seemingly owed money - hence my concerns).  Spent last couple of weeks overdosing on BTC threads, videos etc. trying to understand it but still not sure what to do.  I want to make sure all is super safe.  I checked the public key online and it is registered as 1BTC associated with it.  I'm paranoid as hell I may lose the coin and with it the private key behind the hologram which I have not removed.  I don't have any emails showing me it was logged anywhere or anything, nothing.. when they gave it to me explained the coin was a wallet... I'd feel much better if I could plug it into a USB or something but nope... just a coin with a key on the back.  I've waited too long to ask for help.  Deep breath... thanks in advance!"	Not

If your food tastes bland, it needs to be salted and this recipe calls for none.

The internal meat of chicken will never get flavors from marinades or other sauces, as they don't penetrate but 1-2mm into the meats.

Try using a brand called diamond kosher salt. Table salt is a lot more dense, and therefore, it's easier to over salt your food. Diamond kosher salt is fluffy like snowflakes. So you can actually see how much salt you're sprinkling onto your food. "	"To put some numbers to your snowflakes:

Type of Salt Weight per Cup.

Table Salt 10 ounces; 280g

Morton's kosher salt 8 ounces; 225g

Diamond Crystal kosher salt. 5 ounces; 140g

Maldon sea salt 4 ounces; 115g
