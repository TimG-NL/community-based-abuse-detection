1962	"Article text because ChicagoTribune is run by useless pieces of shit and forces you to sign up: Lamont Cathey was a promising Chicago basketball prospect, a dominating NUMBER-NUMBER center who had the potential to play at a Division II college until he was arrested and charged in the theft of money from a pizzeria safe more than a year ago. Unable to post a $NUMBER,NUMBER cash bond, the West Englewood NUMBER-year-old languished in Cook County Jail as legal wrangling over his low-level burglary charge dragged on. Eventually, after months stuck in limbo when a plea deal fell through, something inside the teen cracked. He began to swallow anything he could get his hands on in his cell — screws, needles, a thumbtack, a NUMBER-inch piece of metal, even strips of leather from restraints, according to jail officials. Kadner: A pilot program to help, not jail, the mentally ill Kadner: A pilot program to help, not jail, the mentally ill At one point, Cathey had swallowed so much metal that doctors couldn't tell which items were newly ingested. He destroyed a $NUMBER,NUMBER hospital bed, a camera in his jail hospital room and even dismantled a medical device so he could swallow a metal piece inside, officials said. According to jail officials, at least $NUMBER million has been spent so far on Cathey's medical care — more than any other inmate in recent history — as he has been hospitalized two dozen times in the nearly NUMBER months since his arrest and had multiple operations to remove objects from his digestive tract. Adding to the expense, jail officials said they have been forced to post a NUMBER-hour guard outside Cathey's cell to prevent him from harming himself further. ""He's literally eating the jail,"" the jail's executive director, Cara Smith, said in an interview. ""This case to me is a perfect example of the failure of the criminal justice system ... It's been a crushingly sad and very frustrating case."" lRelated Inmate killed in Cook County Jail shouldn't have been locked up there LOCAL NEWS Inmate killed in Cook County Jail shouldn't have been locked up there SEE ALL RELATED NUMBER The jail has long been a dumping ground for the mentally ill, a byproduct of widespread cuts in mental health services at the city, county and state level over the last decades. Currently, the massive complex on Chicago's West Side identifies nearly one-fourth of its roughly NUMBER,NUMBER inmates as mentally ill; that population, according to jail officials, is about three times as expensive to care for as other detainees. In many cases, inmates are locked up on relatively minor charges but do not have the money to post small bonds to be released. So what began as a boot-camp sentence for Cathey will likely end with the teen going to prison, as he has been accused of threatening and shoving a jail guard and was allegedly found with contraband — a catheter needle — in his cell last October. The incidents led to new charges. Psychologist to head Cook County Jail Psychologist to head Cook County Jail ""He was a young kid coming into our custody, an impressionable young man, and he has taken on probably every negative behavior he has seen others exemplify,"" said Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia, a clinical psychologist who will become the jail's new executive director. ""For him now to come into a correctional institution at such an impressionable young age, he's relied on us to parent him. And, at times he will allow our staff to do so, and at times he would rather be parented by the other inmates."" Cathey's family said he was never depressed or suicidal before he was arrested. They blamed the jail for his deteriorating condition. ""It's probably the jail that done that to him,"" said his older brother, Kenneth Barber, who talks to Cathey by phone from the jail. ""I don't really know why they've still got him locked up. He's trying to make it seem like he's OK, but I know he ain't. He's trying to stay happy for us, I guess."" Attorneys from Northwestern University law school's Bluhm Legal Clinic, who represent Cathey on his criminal charges, declined to comment. But in their court filings, they argued that Cathey desperately needs mental health treatment the jail isn't equipped to provide. cComments ""By all accounts, Cathey had a rough time growing up. His father was absent, and his family was not always supportive, according to his coaches. He was arrested NUMBER times as a juvenile, although none of the cases resulted in a conviction. Police records identify him as a gang... SOUTHSIDE GAL AT NUMBER:NUMBER AM MAY NUMBER, NUMBER ADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS NUMBER ""In over NUMBER years of practice as a social worker and attorney, I have rarely encountered a young man who is in greater need of treatment than Lamont,"" one of his attorneys, Marjorie Moss, wrote in a court filing seeking to have Cathey sent to a psychiatric facility. ""One thing is clear: Lamont requires structured, long-term psychiatric residential treatment. Without that treatment, Lamont will continue to deteriorate."" By all accounts, Cathey had a rough time growing up. His father was absent, and his family was not always supportive, according to his coaches. He was arrested NUMBER times as a juvenile, although none of the cases resulted in a conviction. Police records identify him as a gang member. Not long before his first adult arrest, he enrolled in Community Youth Development Institute, an alternative charter high school in the Gresham neighborhood. There, the basketball coaches took to calling him ""Big Boy"" because of the left-hander's size. ""This is a second chance school; you understand what I'm saying?"" Cathey's former coach, Jerry Ewing, said last week walking through the school's busy halls echoing with the shouts of students and staff. ""Sometimes, this is the last stop."" Sometimes, Cathey lacked even the bus fare for school and had to call one of the coaches for a ride. ""He just wanted to be successful, I think,"" said Cathey's cousin Charles Drake, NUMBER. ""He just needed the right guidance and he wasn't getting it right then. He's got a good heart. He just got some wrong turns."" Said Coach Jarmichel Williams, NUMBER: ""I was going to teach him to lay carpet because he's always like, 'Man, coach, I need to make some money.' It was always going back to the family structure, not having this, not having that. ... He talked to me about certain things he just didn't have. He didn't feel like he had his family's support. Because I would say, 'Why don't you have someone come to the game?' He's like, 'Coach, man, you here, that's enough.' "" About five months after he started at the alternative school, Cathey broke into the manager's office of a Near North Side Lou Malnati's on Super Bowl Sunday of NUMBER, according to court records. The manager opened the door and saw him crouched over a pile of money next to an open safe. Cathey told the manager that he hadn't taken anything, showed him his pockets were empty and walked out, the manager testified at a hearing. Police arrested Cathey moments later after the manager called NUMBER. Cathey was locked up on that case when police learned that he had also stolen a set of car keys from a Ukrainian Village yoga studio in November NUMBER, court records show. Three days after that incident, Cathey allegedly broke into the security office of a Wicker Park nightclub and was arrested, records show. Cathey pleaded guilty last year to burglary in a plea agreement that called for him to get boot camp, but his mental health issues and a suicide attempt while in jail kept him from being accepted, court records show. A few months after the boot camp deal fell through, jail officials said, he began engaging in self-destructive behavior. Doctors said it can be difficult to determine whether an inmate is mentally ill or is acting out in the hopes of being moved to a hospital. ""Whatever chance I get, I am gonna kill myself,"" Cathey told a forensic psychiatrist who was ordered by a judge to examine him in December. ""They can't stop me from killing myself."" Last September, Cathey refused to give his food tray to a guard and, when the guard entered his cell to remove it, the teen allegedly shoved him, according to court records. Still, a few weeks later, a judge agreed to have Cathey released on electronic monitoring and confined to his home except to attend mental-health counseling, court records show. But while out of the jail, he continued acting ""erratically"" — leaving rambling messages requesting therapy on the phone service attached to the ankle monitoring device, his attorneys wrote in a court filing. Three weeks later, he allegedly cut off his electronic monitoring band and was taken into custody at his mother's home. He yelled and screamed all the way back to the jail, according to an arrest report. He's been in jail ever since, and his troubling behavior has continued. Cathey's case — though not his name — came up this month at the City Club of Chicago, during a discussion by four leaders of the Cook County criminal justice system. There were murmurs and a few gasps in the room full of judges, prosecutors and politicians as Sheriff Tom Dart mentioned the case. ""We have a guy right now that has cost us — has cost all the people in this room — close to a million dollars in health bills because he constantly eats the jail,"" Dart said. ""Across the country, the easy thing to do was cut mental health services and they've done it. So people don't get better, they don't get treatment — they go to jails and prisons and emergency rooms."" Last week, the sheriff's office moved Cathey into a newer section of the jail where he seems to be doing better."	EXP

707	False. There is a very good reason for it's reclassification. Pluto is just one of many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). When Pluto was discovered and classified as a planet, we didn't know that these other very similar and very close together bodies existed. If we classify Pluto as a planet, then we have to classify many (or all) of the other KBOs as planets to avoid arbitrarily picking just one or two of them and calling them planets. And since we're letting the Kuiper Belt Objects in on the planetary action, we'd be forced to look at the Asteroid Belt again. The same process that happened with Pluto and the other KBOs already happened with Ceres and the other Asteroids in the 19th century. The first few Asteroids were considered planets until we realized there's tons of them, and they all far more resemble each other than they do planets. If we count all of them then we're left with a mess of hundreds or thousands of planets. So instead of that, the IAU decided to follow prior precedent, and Pluto and the other KBOs went the way of the Asteroids. Unlike the KBOs and Asteroids, the NUMBER planets are all unique.	NOT

120	Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults. Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult. Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above). ----------- With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen. If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting NUMBER shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey. It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots.	NOT

394	I remember when I was trying to learn japanese that in one of my dreams I met a group of people that were speaking japanese to me and I was speaking back as if I knew what I was talking about. And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language. But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say. I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn. Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness. I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about. Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style. But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream. I've never met someone that could. And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to. It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about. I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt. I mean yeah they'll believe you, but they aren't the ones dreaming it.	NOT

I feel no need to dominate women since that would mean having to be in the company of a woman. Nothing about the female body is beautiful to me. Not every gay man is a woman trapped in a mans body. I'm glad I was born a man. I fucking love being a man. I find men that act feminine just as annoying and unattractive as an actual female. I am a masculine man that is attracted to other masculine men. I realize that this is my opinion and that not every gay man who identifies as a bear despises women the way that I do. As far as I'm concerned a woman is capable of achieving just about anything that a man can. I just prefer that she doesn't do it around me. I also realize that not every masculine man is perfect either. There are a lot of douchey assholes out there who are way too alpha male for my taste.

468	"No, you seriously aren't understanding what mainstream Muslims believe and I don't blame you, many people on the Internet share this naive and sophomoric view of Islamic doctrine. Most Muslims do not get their religious knowledge from the Quran, in terms of what Muslims practice, the Quran has little to do with it. The fact is that most Muslims do not read the translation of the Quran and even if they did, it's not easily understood without some hadith to support it and give it context like what conditions it must be followed in etc. This is why most Muslims rely on hadith and teachings that are passed down, hadith is much simpler to understand and that's what most Muslims follow. Most Muslims agree that the Quran itself is not enough to understand and practice Islam and even the hadith can be slightly problematic in terms of reliability and contradictions. This is why they rely on fiqh, the four schools of thought hanafi, hanbali, maliki and shafi have simplified the teachings into reliability and made rulings on what's permissable or not permissable. All sunni Muslims follow one of the four schools of thought, except the people who identify as just sunni as sunni means a follower of the sunnah and sunnah is the way of Muhammad. There are slight disagreements between the four fiqhs but generally they're close and they aren't really regarded as wrong by other schools of thought. The problem with contemporary issues is that scholars and imams make rulings based on implications e.g TV being wrong, cartoons, etc. This is one of the reasons why some Muslims say certain things are prohibited whilst doing other things. Again, what Muslims do and do not follow is heavily based on culture. A hanafi Muslim in UK who follows his religion is very different from a hanafi Muslim in Pakistan. They both follow the same school of thought but it's society and culture which influences the lifestyle. There's also not a lot to ""remove"" half the things in the Quran that seem violent go along with the context of hadith, some other things have been examined by the fiqh and contemporary scholars and by cross referencing hadith, the verses have been redefined. E.g there's an importance of God's law which must be followed, then there's hadith saying sharia law for you living in a non Muslim country is to follow the laws of the land."	NOT

Who sunk the most three-pointers in the NUMBER NBA playoffs? Bam, right off the top of his head. What's the Third Amendment to the US Constitution? Uhhh, durrrr, ummmmm.... freedom of religion? Can you name one of your US Senators? I, uh... er, well.... Fuck. And what's even the sense? So you can stand around the break room or water cooler or whatever and talk to Joe Eighteenpack about Jamal run with ball?

Jamal run good. ----- NUMBER  Did you see Jamal run with ball last night?  I did. Jamal run bad. DaQwon run better. ----- That's it. That's the totality of all sports conversation summed up in four total sentences. You can send me emails thanking me for all the otherwise wasted time I just saved you. Instead of talking with Joe Eighteenpack about Jamal running with ball, why not talk to him about how there's a continued push to strip Americans of their 2nd Amendment rights? Or about how the lefties want to turn everything white people say into hate speech? Or go hardcore and bring up that NUMBER% of the population commits NUMBER% of all violent crime in America.

The implication is that the person who uses the word already has (knowingly or not) a demeaning outlook on homosexuals because of being accused of using said term in a negative way; when, in reality, what is happening is that it is the offense-truffle-pig (usually a feminist of some sort) who has interjected the idea of insult where none was in the first place. Unless you're talking to an obvious homophobe, people in mature discussions don't say ""gay"" thinking to themselves: ""Ha Although this word is perfect contextually to describe someone in the terms of the discussion we're having, I also subtly get to insult them by turning them into a one-dimensional caricature!"" But the offense-truffle-pigs sneak that possibility in as ""true"" based solely on the fact that: (a) they were able to think of it, and (b) they can conjure up at least a hypothetical person who could find the use of whatever term uncomfortable.

Maybe they should not have originally called it feminism if that's what it really breaks down to, but they did...I just disagree. “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” ― Daniel Patrick Moynihan Maybe they should stop pretending it means being pro-equality, when it clearly does not. You cannot hold a particle of common sense while espousing two diametrically opposed ideas. Idea NUMBER: Feminism as a word does not describe a philosophy of equality. Idea NUMBER: Feminism is about equality. You are not actually allowed to simply ""disagree"" with me when I present a fucking fact, pal. It stays a fact in the very teeth of your ""disagreement"". One of these ideas has got to go. Which one is up to you, but I feel it necessary to reiterate that the definition of Feminism as the same as Egalitarianism is a political definition without basis in history or grammar, while the other is a small-T truth.

Then the pianist picked up a trumpet &amp; the drummer counted off at an insane tempo. I get it, see if the new kid can keep up. I did, praise God, &amp; they were very cool, asked if I wanted to do another but it was time to go so I promised I'd be back. All in all, a fun time and world class players, to be sure. Plying my trade in Palm Beach these days. Love NYC, hate winter. There are a number of jazz venues down here but not like up north. I'm excited to see Joey DeFrancesco next month in Ft. Lauderdale. I recently picked up a NUMBER Hammond CV &amp; am studying with Tony Monaco via Skype. Whoever tells you, piano/organ, same thing, all keys, doesn't have a clue.

As a pianist for over NUMBER/NUMBER century, standard MO is splitting chord tones between RH/LH, I'm going insane attempting to visualize chords voiced NUMBER% differently. For the most part I keep my root-NUMBER in the LH on piano using RH for the color tones. On Hammond, I play the color tones in RH but NUMBER-NUMBER is missing. Inserting them in the bass line isn't the same thing. A truly humbling experience but Tony is on a NUMBER-NUMBER week Asian tour &amp; I'm working on ""Song For My Father"". Really digging ""Groove"" Hoimes' version, as Tony's, Joey's &amp; others. If you know of any other hip Hammond versions, turn me on to them, please. In any case, nice to meet you.

414	I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes: I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well. It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes. And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than NUMBER star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. Current top series:  Way of Kings/Words of Radiance: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)  Song of Ice and Fire: Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change.  LOTR Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling, it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is fantasy with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.  Riyria Revelations: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.  Dresden Files I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role.  Hard Magic Series: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.  Ready Player One:Just a fun read. The NUMBER's were fun.  Enders Game: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.  Wheel of Time series: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.  Hitchhikers Guide series: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.  Asimov's Foundation Series More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.  Dragon Riders of Pern:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?  Harry Potter: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.  Artemis Fowl series: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. Books I like:  Mistborn: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.  Same for everything else written by Butcher: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.  Legend of Drizzt: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.  Iron Druid series I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.  The Shadow of What was Lost : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book. Do not like:  Name of the Wind As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.  Monster hunter international Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.  Tried The Malazan Book of the Fallen: just couldn't get into the story.  And all my friends keep begging me to give the Dark Tower Series another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.	NOT

You cannot write a program for a machine that didn't exist. She wrote down an algorythm (nothing new) and later, after programs and computers had actually been invented, SOMEBODY ELSE wrote a program for her. Do you really think there's some kind of mass conspiracy to honor some random woman that wrote a meaningless algorithm in the 1800s? Conspiracy? There is nothing secretive about what happens in the world: Women are praised disproportionally compared to man. Was her algorithm the first that could be used on a computer? Nope. So why is hers the special one? Cause she has a stinking vagina and because there aren't enough female contributions to science, that's why. It's like visiting some backwards civilization that you didn't know still existed or being a fly on the wall during a klan meeting. It's clearly backwards to evualte humans according to their responsibility and performance, rather than sex and political correctness. /s I answered because I have higher than an 8th grade education &amp; anyone with higher than an 8th grade education could answer that.

To reiterate, I think one-mindedness comes from being in power for a long time. I believe the as more time passes the Republicans will eventually conform around specific goals and work rather cohesively. That may be around the WH or it may not. It kind of depends on what their constituents want. I know that the RNC has many fractions. What I'm saying very bluntly is that if they can't figure out those fractions is screwed because then they'll accomplish nothing and lose power. The reason why comparing the RNC to the DNC isn't false equivalency, in summary, is because they were ""hired"" to a do the same job; run the country. The the RNC can't figure out a way to do that effectively then they're not doing their jobs and people who vote R will become and should become pissed off. As for Trump, he needs to keep campaigning on it. He should keep on message and repeating that message until the job gets done. Without that focus and effort the RNC gets to fight among itself and get nothing done. Just imagine that Trump laid down a clear idea of what Trumpcare was, what you would get and why it was better. Not just Obamacare sucks but ""this is my plan. This is why it's better."" Trump won the election. If he could get enough of the R electorate on his side the Senate/House would be forced to follow.

Blowup of the Year (For when Viscant went in on him on Twitter) Fuccboi of the Year He also was the runner up on Stream Moment of the Year (When Viscant popped off on Low Tier God after the match) Saltiest Moment/Player (When he got desperate for a verbal comeback and pulled out the race card, saying he was just mad at Viscant because he called him A Black DSP/DarkSydePhil) So please don't defend Low Tier God's actions. The bitch can never man up and admit when he is in the wrong ever. He's a cancer to the FGC has been a joke/fuccboi in the FGC way before Viscant blew him up on Twitter and then IRL. He just simply got what he deserved, and that's called karma. And once again.... Thank you Based Viscant. EDIT Again: I WANT TO MAKE THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR. You probably see alot of people dickriding Low Tier Fraud in that match, we actually have lost a lot of respect for those people in the Kappa Reddit board... even the man announcing.. who is Alex Valle (and keep in mind this man is no scrub.. he's a legend and one of the greatest American fighting game players in Super Street Fighter II Turbo of all time, and was once very solid with Ryu in Street Fighter IV) So with that said... THE MAJORITY OF US IN THE FGC, DO NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM WANT A THING TO DO WITH LOW TIER FRAUD, AND ANYONE IN THE SOCAL AREA THAT WAS DICKRIDING HIM. PERIOD. Infact on the Kappa Reddit board we have zero respect for anyone who likes him. He is hated SO MUCH there that even being his friend will blacklist you. However can we show some love to NUMBER Time Evo Champion of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix &amp; the best Zangief player in the world in Ultra Street Fighter IV named Snake Eyez?

They take it as an insult to their intelligence when I ask basic questions.. Especially if I ask them to restart despite the fact that they said they all ready did that.. ---- I'm super nice and polite about it to. Yesterday a woman cried and cried because she had to type in a recovery key and it was too long and I had to be mistaken.. She puts it in once wrong. I told her how to do it right away, but she ignored me. So it takes everything in my power to get her to try a second time and it doesn't work. And she just flips out... This isn't working, you have no idea what yo're doing.. Blah blah blah. Obviously she isn't putting the key in correctly, but she refuses to try it again. She wants a ticket escalated, and I tell her that in the end all they are going to have her do is put in that key. And she swears up and down No, I'll just get a new computer.... yeah, she eventually put in the key correctly and it worked and then I got an email for raising a ticket for it.. ---- But I get a lot of stuff like the whole plugged it wring and people get so mad when you ask.. I'm a business executive in charge f such and such and I fo such and such.. If you're so high and mighty why did you call me and ask me who in your chain of command to send a report to...

619	"In its original meaning, the term denoted a man of the lowest rank of the English gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers and the younger sons of baronets, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession, and thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. In this sense, the word equates with the French gentilhomme (""nobleman""), which latter term has been, in Great Britain, long confined to the peerage. Maurice Keen points to the category of ""gentlemen"" in this context as thus constituting ""the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France"". Meaning an aristocrat male?"	NOT
1973	The idea of “racism” is a cultural Marxist social theory. Whites cannot be the victims of racism, only the perpetrators of it. Much like the bourgeois cannot be oppressed by the proletariat. Racial equality does not mean everyone being treated equally, it means destroying white people and culture. Talking about race means getting a lecture about how whites are evil. Just like in economic Marxism, where all the problems were due to the captains of industry and all the benefits of industry were due to the working man, in cultural Marxist theory all the problems in black countries and neighbourhoods are due to white oppression, and everything good about the West is built on the backs of exploited blacks. You might think that the glaringly obvious reality is so upside down in this worldview that nobody would believe it. But the smarter people are, the better they are at believing weird things, and justifying those beliefs. This worldview is distributed in college campuses worldwide, and any dissent will have you labelled as a bigot and a backward medieval moron. Take the case of James Watson, a Nobel prize winning biologist, all but destroyed for saying maybe the reason foreign policy with regard to Africa has failed is due to an intelligence gap. He had to sell his prize because nobody would hire him. Contrast this with the case of Saida Grundy, who openly came out against white men, claiming we’re the source of all problems in the world. She has been defended by her university as practicing free speech.	EXP

365	"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out. EDIT Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation:  Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.  ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info)  Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.  While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and maybe it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.  All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead. So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before."

There are many dishes that I would use NUMBER separate pans for in a kitchen but only NUMBER for at home to save time on cleanup and be able to multi task easier. The same with industrial ovens, dozens of knives (although you still use a chef's knife for NUMBER% of things), etc. Plating and decoration make food look better even when it's not, I usually skip that at home but the food's the same quality. Ingredient selection is definitely hampered at home, without wholesale prices and the guarantee that I'll use expensive things before they expire, but that's something that can be partially avoided with planning, or just tolerated if I really want to make a knockout dish.

But at least the jews and capitalism would have lost, and we would work for a greater cause, had hope, were united. Now today its just about how to make as much profit as you can.

There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning. That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had loved their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session. Unless, that is, they paid even more money to have their kids stay in the bogus class. TL;DR: I could only handle three days as a call-center con artist."	NOT

1532	Sometimes even the worst “monsters” can show mercy, compassion, even love…perhaps a twisting or perversion of their feelings, their deep emotions causes them to do such horrible deeds, like serial killers and child molesters who have perverted sexual cravings, or who are partially impotent and can only fulfill their sexual desires by killing rather than fcking…or perhaps fcking then killing to silence their victims (e.g. John Wayne Gacey, Ted Bundy, Richard Speck, the Boston Strangler…etc.) Sometimes they kill then fck then eat: Jeffery Dahmer, Ed Gein (the Wisconsin man who inspired “Psycho”), and that bizarre recent case of a Canadian male porn actor who murdered and then had sex with and ate perts of his male lover… Someone who is actually cold-hearted, merciless, passionless would not bother to rape or torture or kill: it simply is not worth the bother. But a frustrated romantic, an artist, an idealist like Adolf Hitler let his dreams of a “greater Germany” overpower his common sense and basic decency. Hitler was a dreamer and a politician. He had dreams of power and glory and wanted to be loved by the people of “greater Germany” (Hitler was Austrian, not German). Many German people were also very anti-Semitic in those days, blaming Jews for losing the war and for making too much money as bankers, pawn shop owners, insurance agents, and retail merchants at the expense of ordinary Germans, who were very jealous of the Jews’ money during the Great Depression, when many people were truly starving and homeless in Germany. Hitler was a masterful politician who had great sensitivity to the mood of the masses, like the white Southern politicians in the USA who used the fear and hatred of “Negroes” among Southerners to get elected and keep their political power. George Wallace of Alabama was the most recent such racist populists in the USA. Wallace was doing very well in the primaries of even Northern states before he was shot and crippled by Arthur Bremer while giving a speech at a Maryland shopping mall in NUMBER. If Wallace had not been severely wounded, he could have been a real threat to both Richard Nixon’s re-election and to the Democratic party. Politicians like Hitler and Wallace use racial hatred and fear to get votes. They may or may not have personal hatred of those they publicly attack (Jews, Negroes), but they are clever orators and know how to tap into the fears, jealousies, and resentments of the common people….

400	I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. NUMBER years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying NUMBER yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want. Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this.	NOT

93	 Could you elaborate on this point? There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.  I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me. You could be right. I am not such a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line. But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

She's put a lot more on the line than the rich white women who have time and resources to campaign over a minor wage disparity, but it's the same attack on archaic modes of thinking. Moving on, the Latin translation of a word does not make the word. The dictionary says equality, the advocates say equality, so for all intents and purposes, feminism DOES mean the movement for equality between men and women. By the way, I can't find anything to back up your etymology for feminism, so a source would be lovely. Everything I've found says it meant degree of femininity until the feminist movement. And once again, egalitarianism is not good enough. It erases the focus on gender, which just silences the discussion.

1580	obviously brillant inventor I roll my eyes so hard the foundation of my house is about to crack. Why are you so obsessed with women anyway? We live in a world where women wan't to persecute men for no reason and resent our achievements. Women want to be airlifted into postitions of power and have everything handed to them on a plate as the world falls apart around them. Girls are given unfair preferential treatment in education as well as the job market. Women are especially bad when they go into politics. Thatcher and Merkel are inhumane monsters incapable of feeling any remorse or pity. There is a reason why Shakespeare depicted Lady Macbeth as the driving, seductive force behind her tyrant husband. Then there are single mothers who do their best to turn their sons into ball-less, over-feminized losers who feel guilty for being male. The same is true for Ellen-Degeneres-carpet-diving-bull-dykes like you. It's disgusting and shouldn't be allowed. A boy needs a fatehr. To summarize, women are parasites on men. I wouldn't care about women so much if they wouldn't be one of the sole reasons why Western nations fall into ruin and shame. Get a fucking life.

This is shocking, I’m sure, to the left wing at least, because my family is made up of evil Afrikaners. Afrikaners are people who the world almost wants to make racist; we’re told that not wanting to die on farms or watch our family members get killed and our country run into the ground makes us racist. I really believed in the “New South Africa” when I was younger, but you can only turn a blind eye to the evidence for so long. I have been the victim of various violent attacks that were not strictly racially motivated, but did contain a strong racial element. If a white criminal called black victims as many racial slurs during attacks, I’m sure nobody would have a problem calling it a hate crime.

593	"Proudhon's phrase ""property is theft"" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property. If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that anything was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism. Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:  Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint. For the moment, he is still drinking beer, Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water. When others cry savagely ""down with the kings"" Stirner immediately supplements ""down with the laws also."" Stirner full of dignity proclaims; You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free. You become accustomed to slavery Down with dogmatism, down with law. Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give indirect platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ). I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the least keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - NUMBER) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and NUMBER) It's ability to distribute consensus has so much more potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth). So much so that I imagine almost any modern anarcho-communist society would also want base their communications upon it."	NOT

The only reason I wrote that threatening statement is because I have met guys in real life who are used to women sitting down and taking that type of abuse so when they hear comments like the one I wrote they usually calm down and think about what they are actually saying. Yes I am NUMBER and a girl, but not a fool. Attention was not the purpose in this post. I go other places for that. Thank you for simplifying me to a childish emotional teenager whom is characteristically self-centered. Thank you most of all for responding in such a detailed and well thought out way. I will save this comment for when I find myself going off into that stereotypical teenage rampage.	EXP

1870	Who did I say that I hated? As far as my memory goes I've never claimed to hate anyone, except maybe the hateful. As I said, I don't label any of one group as the same. I've lived a long enough life in a culture that was good enough that I can see everyone as their own individual. Take you who is upset with me thinking I hate some kind of people. Non white non christians are a particularly large group. In fact, I'd have to count myself as among them. I may be white, but I'm certainly not christian. I don't have a religion, just like an atheist. I do have a belief in my god, like I believe Jesus did, but he is only one of my idols, like Gandhi, or Martin Luther King jr. They set out to do good and have helped we the society of living beings/creatures into a better world today. Hitler attempted to, failing in his own shortcomings. I do not hate him for that reason, as I have my own shortcomings, (to be clear). I hate his scientist more than him. And I don't mean Einstein. I don't remember the name of the man, but he was the one responsible for the experiments that took place in those hell holes. If you want to hate anyone from that time period he's probably the one. So no. I just love people. Sure they may be stupid at times, and some do manage to upset me, but as a whole I can also see past that and look towards the good. We landed on the moon once, but before that, we had to learn how to get into space. We may have had to see it as a competition with the Russians, but as a result of it, we now have technology that as far as we can possibly tell, has never existed. If people could just get over themselves and their petty squabbles and disagreements, we could do it again, it's just a matter of finding the right way to motivate us. and just for more clarification... the shortcomings, (to be clear) was a part I left out. After a re-read I decided to fix it, I'm aloud to do that.	EXP

It is not my responsibility to dream up a new word where one is not needed. Egalitarianism, Humanism, these terms suffice and while one can technically call oneself these other things as well as Feminist, such a definition is ahistoical and ignores the current environment. The advocacy of Feminism is and has been to advocate for women, including when that advocacy is unfair or biased against men. It's not that Feminism has been stealthily infiltrated by a few bad apples who hate men or work against their interest, it's that a large portion, perhaps a majority, of people who identify as Feminist look at a situation where a woman benefits at the expense of a man as a 'win' regardless of surrounding circumstance. I challenge you to examine where Feminist money goes, where the rallies protest, where the advocacy in politics goes, and I do not see a lot of work for the betterment of humanity.

Damn those black cashiers were slow as shit. Another reason I went to the latino line is because two weeks ago I went to a black cashier named ""Taffini"" and her attitude was shitty and ghetto as fuck. (I tried to buy movie certificates and whoah, it's like extra work for her). Another incident a black Costco cashier was too lazy to push the checkout divider down the belt far enough for me to reach (NUMBER-NUMBER feet????) and the customer in front of me had to get it for me.

1884	Thanks for clearing this up. To be honest your original post was almost unintelligible to me. And now that you've written this, I can understand it better, and in a sense, you're right. Most of the demonizing of Hitler was done by an act of necessity: the world war effort needed propaganda and the current viewing of him as literally the worst person was a mere side-effect of the Allies rallying their people to work harder or fight better, all to aid the war effort. Hitler wasn't the worst mass murderer in all of History, as in that respect he is outclassed by other dictators and historical figures. And yes, it's a shame that he gained Germany's trust by leading them to almost a golden age, then after that making a U-Turn down the darkest path it ever had to walk, but it does go to show just how intelligent he was. Yes, Hitler was bad. But not bad in the Devil's sense, but bad in the sense of Napoleon, or Genghis Khan. Not pure evil, and in fact there were quite a few redeemable qualities in him. It's just a shame that Hitler was around during a time when mass media and its influence were at their strongest, because I feel further meaningful study on the matter cannot happen until the (though somewhat justified) unnecessary taboos with him are dispelled.
