And I waited and waited. As such, I'm sorry, I can't have too much sympathy for people regarding this. Because I know IS is a lot more generous and care more for their game than the other gacha I play, there is no way they would not do a rerun in the next couple of months. I'm just glad they've delayed it as I would prefer not to face more filth emblems in my attempts to get to tier NUMBER. Lord have mercy. They're most likely to rerun Xander/Camus sometime in August as part of the special events.

They've often told us that they missed certain, very specific, things, like ""a chili dog from Big Jim's convenience store"" or ""a milkshake from Cook Out"". But the one thing they miss, generally, is the customer service climate in the United States. Apparently Dutch CSRs start with one of two things: ""don't blame me for [broken item, billing error on the power bill]"" or ""yeah... what do you want me to do about it?"" And although they like that the Dutch healthcare system is actually affordable, it's kind of... strange to navigate. My male friend broke his arm playing baseball. It wasn't a simple break - instead of ""across"" his arm, it went down his arm in a corkscrew pattern (radial fracture?).

2210	"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out. EDIT Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation:  Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.  ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info)  Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.  While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and maybe it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.  All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead. So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before."	1.0	students

429	"No, you seriously aren't understanding what mainstream Muslims believe and I don't blame you, many people on the Internet share this naive and sophomoric view of Islamic doctrine. Most Muslims do not get their religious knowledge from the Quran, in terms of what Muslims practice, the Quran has little to do with it. The fact is that most Muslims do not read the translation of the Quran and even if they did, it's not easily understood without some hadith to support it and give it context like what conditions it must be followed in etc. This is why most Muslims rely on hadith and teachings that are passed down, hadith is much simpler to understand and that's what most Muslims follow. Most Muslims agree that the Quran itself is not enough to understand and practice Islam and even the hadith can be slightly problematic in terms of reliability and contradictions. This is why they rely on fiqh, the four schools of thought hanafi, hanbali, maliki and shafi have simplified the teachings into reliability and made rulings on what's permissable or not permissable. All sunni Muslims follow one of the four schools of thought, except the people who identify as just sunni as sunni means a follower of the sunnah and sunnah is the way of Muhammad. There are slight disagreements between the four fiqhs but generally they're close and they aren't really regarded as wrong by other schools of thought. The problem with contemporary issues is that scholars and imams make rulings based on implications e.g TV being wrong, cartoons, etc. This is one of the reasons why some Muslims say certain things are prohibited whilst doing other things. Again, what Muslims do and do not follow is heavily based on culture. A hanafi Muslim in UK who follows his religion is very different from a hanafi Muslim in Pakistan. They both follow the same school of thought but it's society and culture which influences the lifestyle. There's also not a lot to ""remove"" half the things in the Quran that seem violent go along with the context of hadith, some other things have been examined by the fiqh and contemporary scholars and by cross referencing hadith, the verses have been redefined. E.g there's an importance of God's law which must be followed, then there's hadith saying sharia law for you living in a non Muslim country is to follow the laws of the land."	0.0	students

108	Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults. Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult. Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above). ----------- With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen. If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting NUMBER shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey. It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots.	0.0	students

It has absolutely nothing to do with being ""small-minded"" but simply with them adhering to their ecclesiology. Just because someone really was a good person or even a great Christian doesn't mean that we ought to formally commemorate them as a saint of the church. It's true that C. S. Lewis is a greatly admired figure among many Catholics today but it still doesn't change the fact that they were never in communion with him, and how could any church presume to commemorate someone they didn't know in the Eucharistic body? This doesn't mean that private veneration of saints outside the Church or even saints that haven't been officially commemorated can't occur, and I actually do know a handful of people, including myself, that venerate saints outside of our respective communions. But the public, corporate veneration of saints in our official calendars is a completely different story, and the current state of some of our Anglican Calendars is laughable."	1.0	students

1979	Since the dawn of history the negro has owned the continent of Africa—rich beyond the dream of poet’s fancy, crunching acres of diamonds beneath his bare black feet. Yet he never picked one up from the dust until a white man showed to him its glittering light. His land swarmed with powerful and docile animals, yet he never dreamed a harness, cart, or sled. A hunter by necessity, he never made an axe, spear, or arrowhead worth preserving beyond the moment of its use. He lived as an ox, content to graze for an hour. In a land of stone and timber he never sawed a foot of lumber, carved a block, or built a house save of broken sticks and mud. With league on league of ocean strand and miles of inland seas, for four thousand years he watched their surface ripple under the wind, heard the thunder of the surf on his beach, the howl of the storm over his head, gazed on the dim blue horizon calling him to worlds that lie beyond, and yet he never dreamed a sail He lived as his fathers lived—stole his food, worked his wife, sold his children, ate his brother, content to drink, sing, dance, and sport as the ape --Thomas F. Dixon, Jr., NUMBER	1.0	self

Once upon a time there was an NUMBER year old man who really really loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it. Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her. 'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love. Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well. Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak. The man knew what he had to do. ""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything The wedding was saved ""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment. ""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan."""	0.0	students

351	Hey man, I know all about being great on paper. I would probably disagree with most of your interpretations of God's word which very many people reference and very few have studied. I do believe in the negative effects of porn. I believe in the negative effects of rushing into marriage. One is not less harmful if it is truly hurting the individual. Just as you might say one sin isn't greater than another. God called Christians to love and reflect Jesus's attitude. I have no idea who you are and when I came onto Reddit had no intentions of singling you out so understand I am referencing only my experience. I wouldn't dare expect to change your mind about anything over a little comment. Sometimes the most loving thing you can do for someone is let them figure it out. Take care brother.	0.0	students

No. Because Scripture DOES in fact carry greater weight than some specific Word for a specific time and place. Scripture (aka your precious ""canon"") is for all times and all places. Not all of God's Revelation is. Otherwise we'd have a record of what those poor, ""falsely prophesying"" NUMBER elders said.

84	 Could you elaborate on this point? There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.  I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me. You could be right. I am not such a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line. But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

157	"The Javik DLC from Mass Effect NUMBER is a good example of why management and publishing is a problem. They kept needing to extend and got pushback. Javik was supposed to be a bigger part of the story, but they had to cut it to work on other things. They kept a bit of it on disc because they wanted to finish it after the game was ""finished"" (already rated etc). After that, they finished From Ashes and it was ready by Day NUMBER. So it looked like Bioware decided to cut a chunk of the story out for a few bucks when it actually wasn't the case at the end of the day. I do feel that Andromeda was mismanaged by both dev and publisher though. It's so obviously a rush job in the areas that were hard. Like branching story and those little details. They worked on combat and open worlds instead. So they spent NUMBER million on it, which is a bit too low honestly. ME3 was NUMBER million.

And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language. But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say. I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn. Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness. I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about. Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style. But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream. I've never met someone that could. And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to. It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about. I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt. I mean yeah they'll believe you, but they aren't the ones dreaming it.	0.0	students

The thing is, I wasn't working a sales gig (at least not in the traditional sense): I was a ""talent scout"" for an incredibly shady organization that sought to trick parents into purchasing ""acting and modeling lessons"" for their kids. There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning. That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had loved their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session. Unless, that is, they paid even more money to have their kids stay in the bogus class. TL;DR: I could only handle three days as a call-center con artist."	0.0	students

Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell. Bake NUMBER-NUMBER minutes on the center rack. Rotate NUMBER degrees, and bake NUMBER-NUMBER more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle.

Secondly, I went to lightbleedtest.com, and found no excessive light bleed anywhere. However, the top right corner of the screen does glow more than the rest of the panel. Thus to say, it's inconsistent, but the bleed isn't horrendous. Lastly, it's designed really well. All the stand pieces are metal. I feel confident it can survive a desk bump. It also has a hook behind the monitor as a headphone holder, and there's a hole in the middle of the stand for cable management.

1824	Agreed. Being a gay bear is the most amazing kind of amazing. I'm misogynic in the way that I just don't like being around women at all. I don't get turned on by seeing a naked bitch licking a toilet or think a women's place is only in the kitchen making me a sandwich. I'd much rather make myself a sandwich, in peace and quiet. I feel no need to dominate women since that would mean having to be in the company of a woman. Nothing about the female body is beautiful to me. Not every gay man is a woman trapped in a mans body. I'm glad I was born a man. I fucking love being a man. I find men that act feminine just as annoying and unattractive as an actual female. I am a masculine man that is attracted to other masculine men. I realize that this is my opinion and that not every gay man who identifies as a bear despises women the way that I do. As far as I'm concerned a woman is capable of achieving just about anything that a man can. I just prefer that she doesn't do it around me. I also realize that not every masculine man is perfect either. There are a lot of douchey assholes out there who are way too alpha male for my taste. Being overly obnoxious and narcissistic are traits that both sexes could do without.	2.0	self

611	Honestly? Most things. I've worked as a cook and there's really not much difference between a skilled chef at home or in a commercial kitchen. The main difference is economy of scale. There are many dishes that I would use NUMBER separate pans for in a kitchen but only NUMBER for at home to save time on cleanup and be able to multi task easier. The same with industrial ovens, dozens of knives (although you still use a chef's knife for NUMBER% of things), etc. Plating and decoration make food look better even when it's not, I usually skip that at home but the food's the same quality. Ingredient selection is definitely hampered at home, without wholesale prices and the guarantee that I'll use expensive things before they expire, but that's something that can be partially avoided with planning, or just tolerated if I really want to make a knockout dish. So what CAN I make better than a restaurant? Most everything. What DO I make better, on a day to day basis? Not many things.	0.0	students

I have had good results using Clinique's beyond perfecting foundation--it's pretty full coverage on me (without looking cakey) and has never irritated my skin. For a low-maintenance, everyday work look where I want sheerer coverage, I LOVE Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC cream. This has a very natural finish but still enough coverage to tackle covering blemishes--and never any skin irritation. I'm on my second tube of this now, I get it at CVS and they always offer promotions for PF products. I think it's a great value product for the price point!

1120	I personally have played in a mixed off-season comp the past couple of years and I love it. The main reason for it is my partner and I play for separate clubs and off-season is the only opportunity we have to play in the same team. I have been fortunate though to play in a very good off-season comp. All teams consist of players in the highest tier of grades so the games are just as hard, if not harder, than winter season. The other benefit of playing off-season is it helps to maintain game fitness. May not be the same as your off-season comp but I would recommend giving it a shot! As for stick skills, I know plenty of players who will focus on tapping the ball at the end of their stick and practice dribbling skills in the backyard. Hard to do much if you don't have much room but these basics will help with hand-eye coordination and to speed up basic skills.	0.0	students

However, just as they might not want your problems along with your boons, you might not want to swap lives with them, either. By saying you think the people saying you're lucky are being inappropriate, you're showing just as much disregard for the situation they may be in. To them, you may indeed be lucky. When it comes down to it, you ARE lucky you have a supportive family and SO. That doesn't change that you are incredibly unlucky in many other areas. If people say such things to you, try to focus on the good behind it, which is acknowledging the good things in your life and the people who care for you.

1284	Welcome! First I recommend checking out the Wiki tab here on reddit to read a brief overview of the most important systems. Its not fully filled out yet sorry, but some info there to help you get started. Second, watch the getting started videos on iRacings Youtube page. Some of these are out of date a bit, but still helpful nonetheless. Third, read the sporting code once you become a member. This will cover everything.  Best deal There are a few new member deals floating around. A couple are listed over in the sidebar here --- Not sure if any are still active though.  how not to anger people as a new driver Practice a lot before you race and treat people as you would want to be treated. Ill just say that you already have a big leg up on many new drivers in that you understand the simple concept of empathy. Some people just drive like there arent other humans in the other cars. In terms of practice time, it depends on how skilled you are. Do you have any background at all in sim racing or is iRacing your first venture into this world? Do you have any background in understanding motorsports in general. Do you watch racing? Do you understand racing concepts (drafting, cornering, apex, etc)? If you answered no to any of these questions, you might need to spend more time than others educating yourself. On the other hand If you have plenty of prior experience and knowledge, getting competent wont take too long. Getting fast though takes awhile. For example, I had a long history with sim racing games from the time I was a young kid and it took me close to a year to really get competitive with the fastest guys. iRacing is like nothing else out there.  how to get set-ups NUMBER.

653	False. There is a very good reason for it's reclassification. Pluto is just one of many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). When Pluto was discovered and classified as a planet, we didn't know that these other very similar and very close together bodies existed. If we classify Pluto as a planet, then we have to classify many (or all) of the other KBOs as planets to avoid arbitrarily picking just one or two of them and calling them planets. And since we're letting the Kuiper Belt Objects in on the planetary action, we'd be forced to look at the Asteroid Belt again. The same process that happened with Pluto and the other KBOs already happened with Ceres and the other Asteroids in the 19th century. The first few Asteroids were considered planets until we realized there's tons of them, and they all far more resemble each other than they do planets. If we count all of them then we're left with a mess of hundreds or thousands of planets. So instead of that, the IAU decided to follow prior precedent, and Pluto and the other KBOs went the way of the Asteroids. Unlike the KBOs and Asteroids, the NUMBER planets are all unique.	0.0	students

651	"You should never assume that the person you having a discussion with is dumber than you are. I read your comment but I think you're misusing the term false equivalency. To reiterate, I think one-mindedness comes from being in power for a long time. I believe the as more time passes the Republicans will eventually conform around specific goals and work rather cohesively. That may be around the WH or it may not. It kind of depends on what their constituents want. I know that the RNC has many fractions. What I'm saying very bluntly is that if they can't figure out those fractions is screwed because then they'll accomplish nothing and lose power. The reason why comparing the RNC to the DNC isn't false equivalency, in summary, is because they were ""hired"" to a do the same job; run the country. The the RNC can't figure out a way to do that effectively then they're not doing their jobs and people who vote R will become and should become pissed off. As for Trump, he needs to keep campaigning on it. He should keep on message and repeating that message until the job gets done. Without that focus and effort the RNC gets to fight among itself and get nothing done. Just imagine that Trump laid down a clear idea of what Trumpcare was, what you would get and why it was better. Not just Obamacare sucks but ""this is my plan. This is why it's better."" Trump won the election. If he could get enough of the R electorate on his side the Senate/House would be forced to follow.

However, they have enough where they can say, passionately pursue desires- like Papyrus wanting to join the Royal Guard. For JUSTICE, BRAVERY, PERSEVERANCE, KINDESS, INTEGRITY, and PATIENCE, I feel like they're more like traits than substances, or else Alphys probably would have managed to get those from the souls as well while she was experimenting. With these traits, probably nothing physical would happen to a monster with excessive amounts. They'd simply become extreme representations of those traits. This is why you don't see Toriel melting or disintegrating or whatever from her kindness, or Undyne from her strong need for justice.	0.0	students

I walked in one blustery MLK day a few years back after leaving what I thought was a jazz concert but wasn't, in the theater on 92nd &amp; caught a great piano, bass &amp; drum trio. I was on a 1st date, there was no 2nd, so I humbly asked to sit in. The pianist graciously agreed &amp; we settled on Miles' ""Four"". Then the pianist picked up a trumpet &amp; the drummer counted off at an insane tempo. I get it, see if the new kid can keep up. I did, praise God, &amp; they were very cool, asked if I wanted to do another but it was time to go so I promised I'd be back. All in all, a fun time and world class players, to be sure. Plying my trade in Palm Beach these days. Love NYC, hate winter. There are a number of jazz venues down here but not like up north. I'm excited to see Joey DeFrancesco next month in Ft. Lauderdale. I recently picked up a NUMBER Hammond CV &amp; am studying with Tony Monaco via Skype. Whoever tells you, piano/organ, same thing, all keys, doesn't have a clue. Playing Jimmy Smith style requires bass lines in LH leaving only NUMBER fingers to make the changes. As a pianist for over NUMBER/NUMBER century, standard MO is splitting chord tones between RH/LH, I'm going insane attempting to visualize chords voiced NUMBER% differently. For the most part I keep my root-NUMBER in the LH on piano using RH for the color tones. On Hammond, I play the color tones in RH but NUMBER-NUMBER is missing. Inserting them in the bass line isn't the same thing. A truly humbling experience but Tony is on a NUMBER-NUMBER week Asian tour &amp; I'm working on ""Song For My Father"". Really digging ""Groove"" Hoimes' version, as Tony's, Joey's &amp; others. If you know of any other hip Hammond versions, turn me on to them, please. In any case, nice to meet you.

1797	obviously brillant inventor I roll my eyes so hard the foundation of my house is about to crack. Why are you so obsessed with women anyway? We live in a world where women wan't to persecute men for no reason and resent our achievements. Women want to be airlifted into postitions of power and have everything handed to them on a plate as the world falls apart around them. Girls are given unfair preferential treatment in education as well as the job market. Women are especially bad when they go into politics. Thatcher and Merkel are inhumane monsters incapable of feeling any remorse or pity. There is a reason why Shakespeare depicted Lady Macbeth as the driving, seductive force behind her tyrant husband. Then there are single mothers who do their best to turn their sons into ball-less, over-feminized losers who feel guilty for being male. The same is true for Ellen-Degeneres-carpet-diving-bull-dykes like you. It's disgusting and shouldn't be allowed. A boy needs a fatehr. To summarize, women are parasites on men. I wouldn't care about women so much if they wouldn't be one of the sole reasons why Western nations fall into ruin and shame. Get a fucking life. I have no life because I occasionally leave comments on reddit? You do the same and you spend your time browsing the comment history of others. That's pretty hypocritical. Yes, it's backwards to glorify or promote rape, abuse... So much straw. ...or the general degradation of an entire group of people. You mean what women constantly do to men?	1.0	self

1270	You know, i keep bringing this up to my buddies. The problem with tanks was never them being tanky. They're supposed to be. The problem with them is they share base damage values and %scaling with mages, instead of you know, doing less damage because they're tanks. The justification for this is that supports tend to be behind due to xp and leveling. So what's the obvious answer to these problems? nerf base damage values and change how proximity xp/gold is given, thus putting not only supports, but junglers in a better place to teamfight? No, nerf cooldown, nerf armor and health values, and nerf select CC gods while leaving other problematic ones untouched. It just really really confuses me that they'd absolutely destroy their set meta that was so close to being balance outside of a few problem gods, and instead completely destroy the balance of the game to try something that seems to not be working for the most part. Jungle now seems like a lane partner instead of a ganker, supports end up roaming far more often in order to get more xp to stay relevant, and most god options for jungle have been severely reduced to a key few that offer the instant burst of damage needed to kill someone, then quickly return to your lane partner mid. The entire meta so far just seems like incredible backtrack to s1 early s2 which is what we spent all of s2 trying to get away from.	0.0	students

2486	"Alcohol and marijuana are completely different for me. When I'm high, everything becomes trippy and I am more out of it. It's harder for me to complete tasks (ex. using a microwave, cooking etc). It feels like my motor skills/speed has decreased, but I usually am able to catch/throw things as good as I can sober. Even though I am more out of it, I am told I become chill as fuck and I can keep my cool (even though it doesn't feel that way lmao). There is also a burnout period with weed, making you have an overwhelming need to sleep. Driving home is not impossible but HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. This is good for chill outs with your friends, solo-sessions, self reflection, listening to music and movie watching (no complex movies because I usually lose interest quick). Weed hangovers are a thing, but they don't physically hurt. My head is a bit light headed, and usually I get moderately depressed. Can last up to NUMBER days depending on how much you had. When I'm drunk, my surroundings get desensitized to my brain, if that makes any sense. My motor skills/speed/spacial awareness feel the same, but in reality they're in the shitter. I become very flirty when drunk. I say the truth a lot (sometimes too much), and if I get too drunk I become very loud and make an ass out of myself. Alcohol (depending on the person) has a period cal the ""dizzies"" where you feel like . Alcohol hangovers are a thing obviously, causing heavy headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, lightheadedness and regret. When mixing the two, both the desensitization and trippy combine, fucking me up. It's almost impossible for me to do anything (ex. last time I mixed I watched myself spill a whole box of cereal on the ground and was too fucked to clean it up). I'm still flirty, but not loud. Do not drive home when doing this, you will not have a good time. My body (specifically my face and fingertips) get really fuzzy, almost a pins and needles feeling, but it feels really good. I recommend more weed than alcohol when mixing, cause imo it feels better and it reduces hangover the next day. The hangover is a combination of the two others, so it's not pleasant. Mixing is good for house parties, clubs and concerts. td;lr - They're very different, combined they mix some qualities. Everyone is different, so this might not match exactly what you'd feel, but it'd be similar."	2.0	students

A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent temporary insanity because of a purported psychiatric condition called homosexual panic. The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence. Trans panic is a similar defense applied towards cases where the victim is a transgender or intersex person.  ^[ [^PM](URL ^  [^Exclude ^me](URL ^  [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](URL ^  [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](URL ^  [^Source](URL ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^  ^v0.NUMBER	0.0	students

377	I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes: I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well. It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes. And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than NUMBER star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. Current top series:  Way of Kings/Words of Radiance: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)  Song of Ice and Fire: Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change.  LOTR Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling, it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is fantasy with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.  Riyria Revelations: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.  Dresden Files I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role.  Hard Magic Series: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.  Ready Player One:Just a fun read. The NUMBER's were fun.  Enders Game: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.  Wheel of Time series: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.  Hitchhikers Guide series: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.  Asimov's Foundation Series More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.  Dragon Riders of Pern:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?  Harry Potter: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.  Artemis Fowl series: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. Books I like:  Mistborn: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.  Same for everything else written by Butcher: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.  Legend of Drizzt: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.  Iron Druid series I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.  The Shadow of What was Lost : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book. Do not like:  Name of the Wind As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.  Monster hunter international Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.  Tried The Malazan Book of the Fallen: just couldn't get into the story.  And all my friends keep begging me to give the Dark Tower Series another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.	0.0	students

570	"In its original meaning, the term denoted a man of the lowest rank of the English gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers and the younger sons of baronets, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession, and thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. In this sense, the word equates with the French gentilhomme (""nobleman""), which latter term has been, in Great Britain, long confined to the peerage. Maurice Keen points to the category of ""gentlemen"" in this context as thus constituting ""the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France"".

595	it can be pretty hit and miss. they had a really bad habit of putting fetch quests all over within the main scenario quest, which broke the momentum of the story very often. Heavensward is a lot better tho, and if it could be judged on its own I'd say itd be somewhere around like FF5 quality story, or somewhere in the middle. FFXIV handles its story as one continuous flow tho (unlike the other MMO FFXI which does it in episodic arcs) so the story never seems to get peaceful resolutions that last very long.. which makes for very dismal storytelling. They also have a habit of overdoing drama and killing off characters so often, many of whom we don't get a chance to be invested in.. so yea.. meh.	0.0	students

1589	Early game: khepri has better clear and lane pressure, along with a stronger level NUMBER-NUMBER. Get suffers in the early game due to lack of clear and pressure, since the shield is garbage early. If you are looking for a snowball duo lane then pick khepri over geb. Mid game: khepri's mitigation becomes very useful, and his pull can guarantee a kill. Geb shield starts to come online and can provide better peel Late game: here is where the NUMBER gods separate in role. Geb has a much better initiation and can set up team fights and picks more easily than khep. Khepri is better at extending team fights because of his ult and can provide better late game peel from the root/pull, where as geb can guarantee more survivability. Conclusion: both gods are top tier supports. They both provide different things to a team comp and can be picked on preference. I think it is very ignorant for you to say that khepri is bad since he has one of the biggest pick ban rates in the spl and can change a team fight in many ways. If you are looking to snowball out of the duo lane pick khepri. If you want to farm until late game pick geb. They both do their role well, and because of that u can't say that khepri is bad. Kuzembo is a bad support because he lacks everything. Sure u can say that one is bad compared to the other but that doesn't make him unpickable which is what u seem to be saying.	0.0	students

984	If we go with that idea, I'd say it is more like kids have been given access to an endless fount of information, but have NOT been taught the tools necessary to determine that which is relevant and accurate and how to apply that information to achieve their goals. So they get distracted by Netflix and Marvel Movies and all other sorts of low-impact information. It's a Brave New World sort of argument, I guess. There's too much information out there for any one person to sift through, so they just don't bother. As you say, if they ever need it, they just ask Siri, why bother paying attention? OR they do, but they focus on simple, high-emotion stories and ignore the complex underlying mechanisms and laws at work. They don't need to know about that, they just need to get outraged and demand that something be done. In lieu of building a better world (which takes effort and a solid understanding of reality) they complain about the world they got and hope somebody else fixes it. Take, for instance, this whole hullabaloo around the Fine Brothers, rather than targeting the underlying IP system that enables them to even do what they're doing. The nice thing is that the internet has the ability to teach you good information AND the tools to make use of such information for your own advancement. I try to make this sub such a place. But you have to have some level of underlying intelligence to bootstrap into rational thinking. If you never learned logic, critical thinking, and the biases you are saddled with, you won't even know that you're being distracted and mislead, it just won't occur to you.	0.0	students

1172	I'm a 'ghost hunter' so I was actively looking for evidence while staying reasonable, and not jumping to assumptions. We went to this old plantation that has a church on the grounds. We go their a couple times a year because it's old and creepy, and people have experiences there. Personally I don't tend to believe any one else's experience except my own, and my fiancé because I feel we are the most level headed people in the group. Mine may not be the most exciting experience, but its one of the very few that I have experienced that I NUMBER% believe was paranormal. I was in the church that was supposed to be haunted, and after sitting there quietly we (a group of about NUMBER) began to hear what sounded like footsteps. At first I just rationalized it as the church settling or whatnot but it really did sound like heavy footsteps, even with a sort of heel-to-toe sound. So I sat in the middle of the aisle where I had been hearing them and you could hear the footsteps walk away from me and towards me. I did scream once because the footstep were so loud (almost stomping) and it was RIGHT beside me. I even felt the floor beneath me vibrate a little.

363	I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. NUMBER years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying NUMBER yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want. Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this.	0.0	students

Miami would also be good because you can drive up SC before their primary after Nevada and still help with Florida canvassing after SC.

However, I will be the bigger man here and respond to you like a human being. (NUMBER) Many economists tie the NUMBER recession directly to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act. The lack of separation between commercial and investment banks is likely tied heavily with the Recession. Things along these lines are difficult to prove though, as are many things economically. (NUMBER) I, individually, don't have the right to limit power. But, as an American, I support and elect the people in the government. And the government does have the power to tax and limit power. A tax on the richest of us (read: Wall Street) can be used beneficially to help the poorest of us. Robin Hood took from the rich to give to the poor. And the average person doesn't care about the globally economy of they're still dirt poor. And, because of income inequality, they're getting poorer, while the rich are getting richer. A Robin Hood tax could alleviate the wealth gap slightly. (NUMBER) The fact that the media is owned by so few large corporations. The fact that in many areas you only have one choice for cable providers. I could go down the list. Monopolies exist. Many monopoly laws aren't being enforced. I don't need to create new monopoly laws. (NUMBER) Yet, somehow, politicians still get paid tons of money from corporate donors. Look how many politicians on both sides of the isle are in bed with certain industries. (NUMBER) Profits not being spent on improving the company should be taxed. They're doing no good and not helping the economy by sitting there. Do you really think that Exxon needs as big of a profit as it does? Money should be put to use improving society, not locked away where no one can touch it. (NUMBER) People do store their money in places like the Cayman Islands all the time. People, using creative tax ""loopholes,"" find ways to avoid paying taxes on their money by keeping it overseas. That needs to be stopped. You don't have to agree with me. And, as I said, it's possible not all my ideas would work. I'm not an economist or an expert on the subject. Now, rather than saying you disagree with my philosophy (it's clear that you have a more libertarian economic philosophy, which I don't agree with for a variety of reasons), why don't you say what you believe should be done to eliminate income inequality. Do you even think that's something that should be eliminated?"	1.0	students

2221	"Proudhon's phrase ""property is theft"" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property. If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that anything was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism. Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:  Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint. For the moment, he is still drinking beer, Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water. When others cry savagely ""down with the kings"" Stirner immediately supplements ""down with the laws also."" Stirner full of dignity proclaims; You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free. You become accustomed to slavery Down with dogmatism, down with law. Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give indirect platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ). I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the least keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - NUMBER) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and NUMBER) It's ability to distribute consensus has so much more potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth).

At 60fps a NUMBER shutter is NUMBER/NUMBER second, whereas at NUMBER fps it's NUMBER/NUMBER second, a much bigger difference in motion blur. My suggestion is: shoot anything you think will be slowed down at NUMBER fps. Shoot everything you know will be regular speed at whatever frame rate you're delivering in. If you're unsure, shoot both.	0.0	students

It was the best thing ever I got the VIP ticket and we have an early access to the place along with Q&amp;A session with her, some merch and a pre-show/soundcheck. But she became sick NUMBER days before the concert and lost her voice so she canceled her shows for NY and Cleveland. I won passes for a pizza party with her at a radio station but I was told it was canceled due to her condition. I thought the concert was canceled as well, then around 1pm I realized nobody has emailed me about the cancelation and started freaking out. My only transportation there is a train ride that goes for 1hr and 20min, and the VIP ticket holders have to be there by NUMBER or we'll miss the whole program set for us. I got there around NUMBER:NUMBER, I was crying in the train on the way there too. I went in and told them I'm a VIP and the lady named Victoria was the one who gave me my ticket and merch. She told me to wait for a few minutes and she'll be back. She came back and told me to follow her, she asked why I was late and I told her everything. She also told me how Alessia's been feeling and that they didn't do the soundcheck to preserve her voice for the show tonight. She then followed up with ""so, how about a private, one-on-one meet and greet with her?"" in my head I started freaking out and she took me to her dressing room. It was the craziest thing ever. When she came up the first words that came out of my mouth were ""are you okay? How are you?"" all she can do was mouth the words ""yeah, I'm doing okay. Hopefully I can sing tonight"". I gave her my gift, took pics with her and have her signed some stuff. She's the sweetest and most down to earth famous person I've ever met. She then hugged me and said ""I hope to see you out there"". A few minutes after I left she then tweeted and DMed me on Twitter. That was just insane.

Jeb, with his turtles and guac? Bernie, with his unrealistic pipe dream liberal-land promises? Who else is a realistic candicate? This is why I say that Trump seems to be the top candidate. I like how you said that 'people couldn't handle weed'. I agree wholeheartedly. The government has a responsability to sway people to do certain things, as to not harm themselves or everyone else, or cause harm by inaction. I feel like a president is someone that knows many people, knows how the world works, and knows what is best for the people, kind of like a good, stern parent. Hilary seems to be an absentminded soccer mom sipping on her frappe, Jeb seems like an autistic kid obcessed with turtles and guac, and Bernie seems to be a pothead that thinks 'love is all you need man', thinking that people have the ability to have self-control and provide their justified part in the system as a whole. Trump knows what's best for the nation, at least on the economics side of it, which is likely the single largest point of focus for the US, moving through the years when the EU dissolves, China falls, and mass refugee problems are abundant.

They've been taught a cherry-picked version of religion, so while they might spout off the basics easily, any deep discussion of theological principles will leave them baffled in short order, and they might be misinformed about basic details of how religion even functions. think about the what the cult would want to keep hidden, or lie about. he might know how a cell is organized, but his knowledge of how to contact a cell might have been all lies. he might not know who heads the cult, or if he does, only knows them as a shadowy figure giving out kill orders. if the cult higher ups say, intend to offer up the footsoldiers to tiamat as a snack, he might not know that, because the cult would want to leave out details that might break the narrative	0.0	students

I mean...I just have a worthless psychology degree, but having NUMBER+ million people without healthcare, and not wanting to change to a single-payer system whereby everyone would get healthcare, is just incredibly insulting to those who don't have healthcare. Speaking of, I am one of those NUMBER million+. It's incredibly insulting....what she said. Seriously how could she be so...uncaring?

1325	Yeah I have had these same two for many years. They are what I use daily, sometimes NUMBER-NUMBER hours in a stretch. They are both Singers. The lightweight is a 20u, which is a zigzag and straight stitch. The heavy duty is a 531b, which is straight stitch only. I believe Consew has a model just like the 531b; i think the singer was actually made by consew. I bought them both used, and just make sure to take them to the machine spa for their tune up regularly. They are FAST, which is why I love them. The lightweight is only light compared to the heavy duty (I call him The Beast) because it can sew through multiple layers of vinyl or canvas. The Beast, I am convinced, would sew through a finger, though I've yet to test that theory. It's been a while since I bought them, but if I remember correctly, I paid about $NUMBER for Beast, and maybe $NUMBER-NUMBER for The Little One? I found her on Craigslist, and drove about an hour to pick her up. They are crazy heavy, as the motor is attached to the table, and you just pull the machine head off and take that part to the repair shop. I've had these two for so long, they feel like an extension of my hands :). If you have a sewing machine shop anywhere near you, go in and try some out. If you don't, keep an eye on Craigslist and go visit it. Don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't feel like the right machine for you. They are great machines, but I walked away from one because it hadn't been cared for and it wasn't worth the risk to me. Sorry for the rant, I'm actually sitting with The Little One right now, working on a quilt at night. Let me know if you have any other questions	0.0	students

1795	 It's not her imagination because it DID work once it was put to the test. The defining factor isn't whether or not the inventor lived long enough to see his or her invention work, it's whether or not it worked. It didn't work though. You cannot write a program for a machine that didn't exist. She wrote down an algorythm (nothing new) and later, after programs and computers had actually been invented, SOMEBODY ELSE wrote a program for her. Do you really think there's some kind of mass conspiracy to honor some random woman that wrote a meaningless algorithm in the 1800s? Conspiracy? There is nothing secretive about what happens in the world: Women are praised disproportionally compared to man. Was her algorithm the first that could be used on a computer? Nope. So why is hers the special one? Cause she has a stinking vagina and because there aren't enough female contributions to science, that's why. It's like visiting some backwards civilization that you didn't know still existed or being a fly on the wall during a klan meeting. It's clearly backwards to evualte humans according to their responsibility and performance, rather than sex and political correctness. /s I answered because I have higher than an 8th grade education &amp; anyone with higher than an 8th grade education could answer that.

Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with.

The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much.

2206	I dont watch the liberal media, i don't watch nascar, (because i wasn't born in the south to have an interest in it) and you are making so many baseless assumptions it's pathetic. Your inner libtard is coming out and it's not fashionable anymore. It's crazy how someone living in the same country who got the same education could be so diluted and far from common sense and truth. Tell me, did you have a steady diet of paint chips as a child and even into adulthood?	1.0	students

1418	"Yes, exactly. Of course, not every genderfluid person has the same experience as I do, but I don't feel the need to strictly label myself ""man"" or ""woman"". Another thing worth noting is I do put my sex as ""female"" on paperwork, surveys, etc (also use female pronouns). Again, some people may prefer to chose the ""other"" option (and they/them pronouns), and for more info about that you'll have to find someone who identifies that way, I can't help you there lol."	0.0	students

99	Honestly, since you have already spent so much, might as well go all the way and get a +NUMBER. It's worth it. You might get another one with the perfect IVs for a Vantage build (+Atk -Hp).

Ans as far as I know, the Ismaili belief is to take things in context, hence my original emphasis on ""Game of Thrones times"". Regardless of whatever the Prophet did, we need to live within the law of our land and our time. The lifestyle of people in the 7th century is incomparable to the lifestyle of the 21st."	1.0	students

1092	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sht about the Cardassians time and time again. By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar. The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."	0.0	students
