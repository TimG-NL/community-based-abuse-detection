He looks amazing when playing in MLS, but besides a few bright moments he looks mostly average when playing in international games so far. I think he doesn't have as much confidence. I really hope he can adapt and become a key player for the US.

5	dkz4mby	dkzobbh	AskReddit	"Not political propaganda, but Rick and Morty brought back szechuan sauce.

Ever since the season premiere of Rick and Morty, people have been repeating szechuan sauce at each other like a pop-culture Freemason handshake. Lo and behold, at the start of the season proper, McDonald's creates a limited release of this obtuse dipping sauce from 1998 most people don't actually remember tasting (if it were really that popular at its release, McDonald's would have made use of it since then). 

People are high-fiving thinking ""we did it"" when McDonald's announces the sauces return (around the same time as the proper season start). This is classical cross promotion at its finest. McDonald's get a PR spike in a demographic it has been spending a lot of money, [and making stupid commercials to court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTxJZyKymA). The premier might as well have been a giant focus group to turn attention their way. If it all had backlash, then it would simply be a gag from a comedy show, but it didn't. 

Rick and Morty advertised for McDonald's, and now we're seeing a very traditional cross promotion and everybody is patting themselves on the back like they made it happen and weren't manipulated the entire way through. "	I totally agree it was an advertisement, but I'd like to counter with this: Who cares? If it was a good part of the overall show and the viewers enjoyed it... Does it really matter? Should we completely avoid using companies just to stop them from potentially advertising?

21	czj6cmy	czja87d	APStudents	From what I heard, Bio is considered harder than Environmental Science, that might be very ignorant, I am not sure, though I rather have Calc instead of Environmental science in Senior Year and have AP Bio as my science.	"You're not ignorant. Bio *is* harder than Envi Sci, that's a fact. Only 5% of people get a 5 on AP Bio. 

Don't waste your time taking AP Envi Sci, stay with AP Lang.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

You will come out of that class wishing you were back in it."

But if you think a pair of shoes will help you lose weight, then you deserve to lose the 80 bucks you spent on those shoes, because it's pretty  common  knowledge that there is no magic weight loss thing..

But you shouldn't need a healer in dungeons, fractals and open world content as in those game types, if everyone knows what they are doing (dodge at the right time, perform the right combos, use their self healing skills) then you don't really need a healer. But if you are running dungeons/fractals with people that are not very skilled at the game, a healer can really help to carry those people. 

So in conclusion, only raids need tanks and healers. As for the other content in the game, you shouldn't need those roles, but very low skilled players might make use of it."	To be fair, druids at high level fractals can be very nice. Not necessary, but very, very convenient.

37	dgyoq2c	dgyrwj1	pie	OP, can I get a recipe? I've tried the two in my Pie Town, NM cookbook but they both turned out too dry	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)"

2. when making a healer team, how should i prioritize the different forms of healer skills? i'm guessing that skills that can trigger every x notes are better than skills that can trigger every x seconds, and that skills that can trigger from an x combo are better than skills that can trigger from x perfects, but i'm not sure how to compare skills from the first two to skills from the second two. also, how important is actually having high stamina on this team? unfortunately most of my healers only have 3 stamina..."	"Events are actually calculated so that getting the base/free sr takes the same amount of lp.

As far as healers go, I'd avoid the combo and perfect ones, because if you're getting a long combo or a lot of perfects you shouldn't need a healer team :P note-based are usually best, and timer-based isn't too bad unless you're tanking expert.

For health, as long as you have about 30 total you should be fine"
86		czj5bue	SwagBucks		I thought for this one you had to get the + one, the 29.99 one. is that not the case? can you get the 19.95 one (plus S&amp;H) and still get the 3000SB?
87	dkyqe7g	dkzwovv	AskReddit	I answer questions with questions *all the time*. I honestly didn't even notice I did this, until my brother got annoyed that my little nephew picked it up from me. 	I can relate. I play devil's advocate all the time too and it drives people nuts thinking I'm arguing but I just reeeeaally like discussing things and play the other party subconsciously.
88	dkz5j64	dkzvtuc	TheSimpsons	Simpsons Sing the Blues was the first CD I owned. I never knew it came out on vinyl.	Same here!!
89		dkzqysk	LanternMTG		You gotta take a deep breath and just ask yourself the best questions you can. Was I as prepared for the blind meta as I responsibly could have been and what were my mistakes and how do I learn from them? Past that, you can attribute it to variance and you have to take solace in the fact that you literally did the best you could. Unlike the other people on here I do view not making top 8 as unsuccessful. But I also believe that if you can get 9th, you can top 8. And if you can top 8, you can top 4 and if you can top 4 you can take FIRST. Never doubt yourself and your potential. it gets in the way of sick plays.
90	czjfqsx	czjfxac	NoStupidQuestions	But the laws are harsh. Wouldnt that act as a deterrent to people thinkingbof consuming drugs. 	"In most states the laws aren't that harsh for consuming.  Plus your chances of getting caught consuming drugs are practically zero.  Additionally opiate addiction isn't something you ""think about"".
Also in criminal justice in general deterance doesn't work.  "

92	dgyw9yj	dgywizx	Nerf	"I think you have quite a bit of missing and/or wrong information

Adding brass will not substantially increase accuracy in a spring-powered blaster - no matter which one you're using. Accuracy mostly derives from the darts you use. For example, if you use Elite darts fired from two similar blasters (one with brass, one without), accuracy will not change between them, at least not enough to warrant the use of brass at all.

Use accurate darts and your accuracy problems go away. No need to over-complicate with brass, especially in an underpowered blaster like the Recon."	What would you consider accurate darts?
93		czjb59c	DebateFascism		"&gt; Could you elaborate on this point?

There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.

&gt; I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me.

You could be right. I am not *such* a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line.

But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

EDIT: spelling."

109		dkzs3l5	OctoberBumpers2017		Oh just tearing my house apart and calling it cleaning. Also buying elastic to fix a cloth diaper. 
110	czj8yd0	czj90ls	CasualConversation	I've dropped my LG G3 a few times and it's just fine. I even dragged it across concrete on accident while biking and it's still fine, not a single hint of damage.	Good to hear - thanks!
111		dgyuiiy	FireEmblemHeroes		"Honestly, since you have already spent so much, might as well go all the way and get a +10. It's worth it. You might get another one with the perfect IVs for a Vantage build (+Atk -Hp). 

Otherwise, take the +Atk -Spd one, with Fury your Ryoma will hit 60atk with the Atk seal and still have a very respectable 38 Spd."
112		dkzqgyg	PersonalFinanceNZ		Yes, but I shouldn't worry about it. It'll only be a problem if you have a history of bad credit. NZ credit checks aren't really like the States. - for the most part they just want to see if you have a history of missing payments more than anything.
113		dgz1d82	GlobalOffensive		It just renders models as wireframe, it's not made for wallhacking or whatever, but for model and level design.
114	dkzqfyj	dkzwc3h	NatureIsFuckingLit	Nemo, don't you touch that boat!	He touched the butt!
115		dgyu7t9	SquaredCircle		Wtf, Cesaro floated like Peach in SMB2
116		czjck88	Fallout		How much would you pay for such a mod?
117		dgz0a37	BabyBumps		"I tried it for about seven babies in my family.
All but one were correct."
118	czjef5u	czjfati	Piracy	[verwijderd]	"Same here, including the switch from utorrent. Zero issues. 
 "
119		dkzpa6o	GlobalOffensiveTrade		"you can go for a good m9 - specialist glove forest ddpat cambo for less then 100 k
"
120		dkzs8gr	OverwatchUniversity		"Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults.

Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult.

Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. 

If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above).

-----------

With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. 

Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen.

If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting 1 shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey.

It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots."
121	cziuud0	czj663v	PokemonShuffle	[verwijderd]	Because it's a free match 3 game.  It's like getting upset when someone cheats in solitaire.
122	dgyx5de	dgyxvmw	MECoOp	">Considering the loot rewards in ME:A are garbage, sure.

Yeah, they're about the same in ME3, and that was satisfying to plenty of people. If you're not in it for the gear rewards and just want to ""complete"" the game, plenty of people cheat. Many many other people just don't play at all, and play something else for more than the grind."	"I took issue with ME3's loot system too, TBH. It felt massively unrewarding in the final DLC when it became apparent you had to run 10~ games for one rank of a random UR. The only reasons it wasn't as widely hated as ME:A's, I think, were there were many excellent guns in all rarities (so the grind to max everything but UR was extremely rewarding), and the game was just a blast to play. You could play with purely the objective of trying new builds or just popping some heads or playing some space wizards and it was all gravy. This game currently lacks both of those things.

But yeah, never liked this loot system ever. It'd make oh so much more sense if the entire game/mode were free to acquire."
123	czja8hp	czjajqy	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	Nice, that's somewhere between more-than-respectable and fast! 	stopped the speed reading unless i absolutely need to anymore though, last time i did that the migraine got so bad i threw up :(
124	czj0qk0	czj4seh	GoneMild	Good as in you will still be a little naughty?	Ooh goodness, of course not..😉
125		dgyu0iw	LiverpoolFC		Its probably the fact I've been well on the piss all day, but I reckon the reds are going to be sound today. Up the Reds.
126	dkzn4nl	dkzsj1y	Catholicism	"I learned in martial arts class that in real life the right approach is usually to run away.

(I also learned how to take a katana away from someone; but I doubt that is a skill I will be using anytime soon.  Fun, though.)"	Same here, but emphasis on usually. It's entirely different if other people are in danger as well or if you can't get away.
127		dgywybs	TheLeftovers		Fucking brilliant episode. Stuck the landing
128		czjgcbb	Digibro		"1. I think I'd get paid for all 6, as long as you did in fact watch the ad and video all 6 times. I think youtube doens't count views when the person clicks away before a certain point. 

2. I have no idea if there's any rules regarding IPs tho. Youtube doesn't tell us ANYTHING about how we make money through ads, it's all stuff people have figured out largely through conjecture.

3. The ones that appear in the sidebar of the videos themselves I do make money from, but outside of that I have no idea."
129	dkyq4et	dkzp0xu	Barca	Show me a player who gets less money at Barca than where he was before	That's kind of twisting what you initially said. I didn't say they don't get raises. I said not everyone on the team is making MSN money. 
130	dkzs6se	dkzs86f	BigBrother	Okay well Mattress must be broke af because all he cares about is that $8K.	Jessica: he needs a job 
131	czjdgqu	czjdv2w	IsItBullshit	How do I ride a bike?	Well, you need to make sure it is another brown bike.
132		dkzuhs1	Ice_Poseidon		8k by the way
133		dgz23v3	AskReddit		Thanks for nothing, how about some real cash?
134		dkzovdh	Showerthoughts		"Interesting that you use the term ""viewers"" to describe people who listen to songs. "
135		dkzngci	WahoosTipi		[removed]
136	czj85ni	czj8b9s	AskReddit	Many people who are homeless have mental problems or addiction problems.  Giving them that much cash would not work out well. Not only would the addicts squander the money, Criminals and others would prey upon them.  	...Or they would just get an apartment and a nice meal every day.
137	czj0vr8	czjf92j	Watches	If you're looking for rugged might I suggest luminox? Almost unbreakable!  And at your price range. You could get a top of the line one.	"They're all enormous though, won't work at all with 6"" wrists."
138		dkzwdu2	The_Donald		HA!look! the ol limey bastard is back. rinsed penis got gamed
139	czivpsh	czjcyp7	Games	It's funny because the game has plenty of bad game design as well. I love the game, but it might just be a tad overrated.	[removed]
140	dkzobs5	dkzynp1	AskReddit	"""How are you?"" Most people really don't give a shit, so stop asking."	"There was a good Dilbert on this several (many?) years ago (paraphrased):

Person: How are you?

Dogbert:  Do you mean an actual interest in the state of my life and all of it's dramas, tragedies and minor squabbles?  Or do you mean the shallow social idiom?

Person: Uh, I guess I mean the second one.

Dogbert: Fine.  And how are you?

----

I simply have no internal mapping for this social play.  

I answer in some way (""Fine,"" ""getting along,"" etc.), with no appended question.  Yet they don't even notice and answer anyway, ""Doing good, thanks."""

But yes, we should definitely get deranked/losses every time the Ubisoft game/servers fail which is completely not at your fault. That's the logic of Reddit right? According to these down votes I assume that's what the people wants. Seeing as how you guys think, maybe we should get banned for a day every time the Ubisoft servers fail, and you get downranked to bronze. SeemsGood."

You can just plug in the interface and use it, but don't you need to install the manufacturer's ASIO driver or ASIO4ALL? Otherwise you'll be using the  normal Windows audio stack, which has a lot more latency. CoreAudio also has an aggregate audio device feature, which could be useful to some people. The only way to do this on Windows is ASIO4ALL.

Of those 4, only he and Knight Yuri reduce HP to 30%, thus enabling some Desperation passives for certain units/gear (you do lose passives for 50% HP and above, like GE Edna has, but those are easy to use anyway and pack lesser multipliers too).

Also, back in the era pre-Phoenix&amp;Marta of almost no-bash finishers available, he could equip one for those that picked his SA last year (even tho his dmg is low, he could get the job done in the Tower of Trials)."

169	dgyz0si	dgyzwuf	Libertarian	Let me get this straight? you're saying if I write a novel and want to publish it, the publisher is under no obligation to print my name anywhere on it because my thoughts transferred to paper aren't my property? Are you high?	"If you are stupid enough to hand over the manuscript, without signing any agreements, then yes. Albeit they can be sued for fraud, if they sell it under a different name and you have proof that you wrote it.

But if you are a rational person, you will sign an agreement with them, which will specify that they must publish your book under your name and you get a certain percentage of the profits form sales. "

1. Washington, father of the country blah blah.  Also, I hear he had like 30 goddamn dicks.    
1. Adams, Alien and sedition acts, feud with Jefferson  
1. Jefferson, writer of the declaration of independence   
1. Madison, wrote the constitution    
1. Monroe, the last of the founding father presidents   
1. Adams part 2, his son.  Swore his oath on a constitutional law book instead of a bible.   
1. Jackson, trail of tears, beating people with his cane, etc.  
1. Van Buren, The Petticoat affair
1. ""Tippicanoe and Tyler too"", being William Henry Harrison who died only 30 days into his term after giving his inauguration speech in the rain and catching the flu  
1. and his vice president, Tyler, whose grandsons are still alive   

1. Polk (nobody remembers)
1. Taylor (nobody remembers, but he died in office)
1. Fillmore (nobody remembers)
1. Pierce (nobody remembers)

1. Then there's Buchanan, who was almost certainly gay  
1. Then we're into the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln  
1. Andrew Johnson was his VP and took over when he got assassinated, and was impeached but not removed from office  
1. Grant, the civil war general, famous for a horribly corrupt administration
1. Then we've got Hayes, who nobody remembers  
1. Then Garfield, notable for being ~~the first one~~ assassinated
1. His VP, Chester Arthur  
1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers
1. Benjamin Harrison, who nobody remembers
1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers
1. McKinley, the second assassinated president  
1. Teddy Fucking Roosevelt, trust buster, national parks founder, all around man's man  
1. Taft, mostly famous for being fat and becoming a supreme court justice after being president  
1. Woodrow Wilson, the last president to keep his campaign promises (at least his first term).  President during WWI, had a stroke, and his wife kind of took over.  
1. Harding, the undisputed worst president, until \*ahem\* recently  
1. Silent Cal, his vice president who took over when he died  
1. Hoover, mostly famous for not getting us out of the depression.

1. Eisenhower, the WWII general.  Sent in troops to desegregate schools
1. Kennedy, who slept with Marilyn Monroe and was assassinated  
1. Johnson his VP, who promptly reversed course on Vietnam  
1. Nixon who likely won because Bobby Kennedy was assassinated prior to the election, and of course he resigned in disgrace
1. Ford, who was never elected -- was appointed when Nixon's VP (Agnew) was forced out.  
1. Carter, the peanut farmer, double digit inflation and got the Iran hostages released  
1. Reagan, who took credit for getting the hostages released and played dumb when he got caught doing illegal shit.  He also liked jellybeans  
1. Bush, who famously said no new taxes and then made new taxes  
1. Clinton, who banged an intern and got impeached for lying about it, and set up the conditions for a future economic meltdown  
1. Bush Jr, who created enormous deficits then blamed democrats for deficit spending, also 9/11 and mission accomplished and almost choking to death on a pretzel.
1. Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for not being Bush Jr.  

After that, I forget."	I love your little summaries for each one.

[This is what most of the notes in game look like.](http://loadscreen.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fallout4-2015-11-16-21-09-15-138.png) There's not really a lot of official documents but these notes are common and they mostly look the same, so I suppose he will recognize the style. You could make your note look something like that, and add a Brotherhood of Steel symbol somewhere to make it look more official.

192	dgy6thh	dgytddk	Chinavisa	That's ok, I looked into this and their German passports should work for 144 and 72.	Great.  One other thing to worry about with a TWOV is convincing the cruise line to let you board.  Airlines have deferred keeping track of all the visa rules to [Timatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timatic).  However cruise lines in the past have generally required you to have a visa for all the countries at which your cruise will visit.  This has caused some friction between passengers who don't want to pay for a Chinese visa when a transit should work and the cruise lines who want to keep it simple and require passengers to have a visa.  So you should check with the cruise line to make sure they can board without a visa.

194		dkztcs1	ForeverAlone		I often wonder what women in other states look like. My town is one of the fattest in Texas, so going outside, it's mostly just women with those weird over-hanging beer guts to obese women. When I was spending all week in New Mexico, especially in Roswell, there was a lot of pretty Hispanic girls. I imagine other states only get better.

196		dgyu1ay	MakeupAddiction		I'm very fair with neutral undertones but prefer foundations that are a little yellow over my redness plus I have dry skin so drugstore foundation is pretty much a no go for me too. I do think it's worth it to splurge on a foundation that works for you!  Plus you could waste a lot of money buying foundations that don't work for you so sometimes it's just worth it to buy something you can sample beforehand.

There are four types of people you encounter.  

1. People who like you for the wrong reasons.

2. People who like you for the right reasons.

3. People who dislike you for the wrong reasons.

4. People who dislike you for the right reasons.

Group 4 is the only one you should be concerned about.

I'm cheating, because this is advice I have given to my kids, but middle schoolers are obsesses with all four groups.  Hopefully it'll sink in over time."	"It's perfectly fine for people to have right reasons to dislike you. I'd generalize and say a world where everybody is acting  because of right reasons is a damn fine place. Being concerned about whether people like you is a waste of time. 

People liking you for the wrong reasons are what I would be most concerned about because you never know when they'll realize they're wrong and dislike you. This unpredictable loss of support could be costly in the wrong circumstances. "

221		czjaze9	AskMen		"I go the lecture route. I also think it's a very good idea that you stopped spanking. Everything I have read seems to say its a bad idea, especially long term.

For context I have 2 boys aged 6 and 7. When they mess up my first course of action is to make them feel like I understand them. I don't believe they will listen to me as well if I don't do this. I say things like ""it makes sense that you are angry at your brother, cause he hurt you, but that doesn't make it OK that you threw a rock at him"" then I talk about using words and other ways to deal with anger without lashing out. I also talk a lot about "" how would you feel if your brother did that to you "" kind of thing in an attempt to cultivate some empathy.

I know the listen to me based on how they change and grow. I try not to lecture too much or punish too much because they are kids and they are just learning these lessons. But they probably will end up avoiding trouble just so I don't bore them to death with another bs dad lecture. But hopefully my understanding and compassion is an example for them to follow. Because as well as punishing them I am also teaching then how to deal with conflict resolution, so I want to set a positive example."

229	dkzoey9	dkzqhw6	BitcoinMarkets	Agree.  I first noticed the slide when he mocked anyone who said the halving was priced in (which it was).	"*(Record scratches)*

Say what? I definitely didn't like the mockery, but I also don't think the halving was priced in. I think knowledge of the halving was priced in, ie. it wasn't a surprise to anyone that a halving would occur. But the actual process of pricing in the halving was a gradual one, for two reasons: a) it wouldn't be fully priced in until post-halving, when the threat of negative halving effects would dissipate (e.g. miners dropping off en masse), and b) the post-halving supply shock (of sorts) takes months to price in in and of itself."

232	dkzt53y	dkzvung	BigBrother	"Helps: Jessica, Elena, Kevin

Jessica is getting a lot out of this. Anyone in the house who was on the fence between Jody and Fucktwat United will definitely lean towards Jody after Thursday. They saw how immature, conniving, and idiotic Fucktwat United is, and will want Paul out as soon as possible. Elena will be helped by this as she was a fly on the wall, along with Kevin. They have no true ties with anyone, and nothing will be associated with them.

Neutral: Matt, Cody, Jason, Mark

Cody is in the same position as before. Mark is still safe, and isn't as much of a target, but still is enough of a target that it didn't help him. Jason and Matt are on the majority side right now, but once Fucktwat United falls, they'll be associated with them and will have a hard time assimilating. However, they still are in the majority so they aren't hurt right now.

Hurts: Raven, Paul, Josh, Christmas, Alex

Where to fucking start. Well for starters, Alex made a complete ass out of herself, proved that she isn't trustworthy, and lost all respect from live feeders so she will probably be in hit water after the season. Josh is still an idiot, and made himself target dos after numero uno (Paul) is gone. Christmas has no real ties apart from Josh, who is useless, so anyone present in the room when she was being a raging bitch about Cody's military background will relay it to Jody with no moral qualms. Raven completely shed her image as the poor little dying girl, and is now the immature brat. Also, she still currently exists as Raven Walton, so that fucking sucks for her.

And Paul. Sweet, lovable Paul.

Someone better upload this to Pornhub, because he just got completely fucked. There is literally no way to express how fucked he got."	your Hurts section was a work of art. can you make a bb podcast?

235	dkzqf5v	dkztb5v	IDontWorkHereLady	"I can see how that would be upsetting to see first hand the mistreatment of animals that are under human care and unable to defend themselves or get their own food. This is interesting because this is exactly where the ""angry vegan"" stereotype comes from. Try reading my first sentence again but thinking about factory farm animals. 
Honestly watch someone like Ask Yourself on YouTube who isn't afraid to show factory farm footage while he's making logical arguments or watch Gary Yourofsky's speech
[speech](www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4) 

I can promise you a better understanding of vegan perspective and there's a 90% chance you'll turn overnight.  "	"Please do not assume I am ignorant of the treatment of animals in factory farms. And please notice I said nothing against *humans* eating a vegan or vegetarian diet, only against feeding carnivorous animals a vegan diet.

In fact my only comment on human diets was that not eating at least some vegetables is unnatural for humans. And I was originally replying to your statement of
&gt;I know of people with cats and dogs who feed their pets vegan pet food. It's not too extreme when you think about it. Yes the animals naturally eat meat but when you buy pet food that isn't meat is it?

Edited to add, that trying to paint  the situation as a choice between factory farmed meat or a vegan diet, is as invalid an argument as using crappy  bargain brand pet food to justify feeding obligate carnivores vegan diets, or  someone using vegan junkfood to justify not eating vegetables. 

Picking the worst possible example of something you disagree with, and comparing to a really good example of something you agree with just makes it look like your position can't stand on it's own, and like you  think the people you are trying to convince are too stupid to see through the way you warped the facts.

Nevertheless, *you personally* aren't really contributing to the conversation by lobbying out little ankle-biter comments like ""Who said the US is a highly developed, first world country?""  That's why you're being downvoted all over: for being oblique, for stating falsehoods, and for unnecessary condescending hostility.

Having a political point of view doesn't mean that you can deny reality.  Having any point of view is pointless when you do not actually communicate it, as you did not do here until your second comment.  I honestly had no idea you were on about the wealth distribution.  For all I knew, you were upset about the lack of single-payer.  And finally, if you want to avoid downvotes, stop referring to your fellow redditors as ""sheep.""  From the evidence of your comments, you don't have a deep knowledge of anything, so please do not condescend to others that you do not know."	"Which falsehoods did I state?

I was downvoted way before I called people sheep.

261	dgydx2a	dgz2gv8	Games	"I wasn't the impression that Bioware was gutted of talent, I was and am under the impression that Bioware's talent is mismanaged.

I don't doubt for a second that they are immensely talented. But when you look at their more recent games, its obvious that their talent is not being reflected on all facets of their work."	"The Javik DLC from Mass Effect 3 is a good example of why management and publishing is a problem. They kept needing to extend and got pushback. Javik was supposed to be a bigger part of the story, but they had to cut it to work on other things. They kept a bit of it on disc because they wanted to finish it after the game was ""finished"" (already rated etc). After that, they finished From Ashes and it was ready by Day 1. So it looked like Bioware decided to cut a chunk of the story out for a few bucks when it actually wasn't the case at the end of the day. 

I do feel that Andromeda was mismanaged by both dev and publisher though. It's so obviously a rush job in the areas that were hard. Like branching story and those little details. They worked on combat and open worlds instead. 

So they spent 40 million on it, which is a bit too low honestly. ME3 was 40 million. Andromeda was a whole new engine AND a revamp of everything gameplay related. "

If you're so frightened by a bit of offensive graffiti, I hope you never enter a public restroom stall."	"&gt; For all we know, it could have been some 14-year-olds who thought they were being really edgy and mischievous.

The problem with this argument is that it's just as likely that it was a KKK member in a hood. Either way, it's bad. Either way, it's hurtful. Either way, it's disgusting. What difference does it make?"

276	czjb8s5	czjc0iy	ADHD	I didn't know it was free for a year as a student! I just started going back to school and have been debating getting ynab for about 5-6 months! Thanks you may have just saved my financial future! 	Oh, I'm glad! If you can't find the student discount area on the website, you can email their support team with your student ID info &amp; schedule for this year and they'll give you a 1-yr activation code. You can repeat yearly as long as you're in school! Hopefully by the time you're out, you can easily afford the official licence, since you'll be a great money manager by then :)
277	dgyxue6	dgyyegz	iRacing	"Not really, I keep hearing stories of how some of the top racers are still using G27's etc.

However a nicer set of pedals and a good wheel might help with your enjoyment of the game."	"They might be using g27 as a wheel (think some of them even turn off the FFB), but they are definitely not using the stock pedals for it.

If any equipment will help, it'd be better pedals."
278		dgyte76	Fantasy		I can't bloody stand them.  It's input overload for me, I find the background noise to be so distracting that I can't even process the words. That being said a lot of people have enjoyed them, and I'm glad they did, I just can't stand them personally.

280	dgysxea	dgyt7dd	DotA2	They get it, and so do I when I play offlane, but it makes their laning worse until PMS is complete. Pretty sure they would prefer being able to get 200g Stout Shield->PMS rather than 300g Slipperies->PMS, or even get Iron Talon+Stout Shield.	For sure, it would be better, but PMS adds so much value in lane, that most of the time I take risk of having less regen and rush to that 200g and complete PMS in lane.
281		dkzojg6	Warframe		"The [Prime Vault](https://www.warframe.com/prime-vault) will be available until sometime August 1st. In my opinion ,it is worth picking up. It contains a lot of good weapons. Rhino Prime is very strong, and Mag Prime is average.

Prime Access is so-so right now. Oberon Prime is pretty average. Silva &amp; Aegis Prime and Sybaris Prime are good.

The Steam Packs are not worth it at all."
282	dgyt6s4	dgyu4cw	Jeep	You don't need Rigid for a backup light or a light bar for that matter, you can mount any old led like this one - KAWELL 2PCS 18w LED Work Light Off Road Led Lights Bar Fog Driving Bar Jeep Lamp (2 Pack Flood Black) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HT642WY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_khObzb20004HT	so any led will fit im guessing?
283		dgyvrez	MakeupAddiction		"I have oily skin with acne scars and redness, and some lingering adult acne. I also have minor discoloration from psoriasis around my eyebrows. I have had good results using Clinique's beyond perfecting foundation--it's pretty full coverage on me (without looking cakey) and has never irritated my skin. 

For a low-maintenance, everyday work look where I want sheerer coverage, I LOVE Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC cream. This has a very natural finish but still enough coverage to tackle covering blemishes--and never any skin irritation. I'm on my second tube of this now, I get it at CVS and they always offer promotions for PF products. I think it's a great value product for the price point! 

I've also found Too Faced's Primed and Poreless primer to be a great daily primer for smoothing out the look of textured skin for acne scars, and this also hasn't clogged my pores. 

Edit: additional info

286	dkzn6s3	dkznovu	Roadcam	"> Show your working then?

I did. You said that normal overtaking would take 7 seconds if I'm going 120 and other car is going 80. You also said that this includes 2 seconds of buffer space before and after the car, this leaves 3 seconds to cover the 5 metres of the actual car itself. That's wrong and the numbers are taken out of thin air. They're not related to the real world in any way whatsoever. 

>Why does the video say you need half a mile of overtaking space then?

I don't know, maybe it's because that video is almost fifty years old? Cars were a lot shittier back then than they are today. 

>Seems like your link applies to motor vehicles and not bicycles?

Google Translate skips a few lines for some reason. 

What it says is that it's illegal to move livestock, ride on horses, ride bicycles, mopeds, all versions of quad bikes and all other modes of transport except for cars, motorbikes, trikes and cars with trailers, unless their top speed due to their construction or mechanical state is lower than 60km/h. 

>Cyclists ride on the road just like trucks do.

Cyclists can cycle on the side of the road, making it a lot easier to overtake them safely, because you don't have to go all the way into the oncoming lane. "	"&gt; They're not related to the real world in any way whatsoever.

The safe following distance for vehicles is 2-3 seconds. This is not some number out of thin air.

&gt; What it says is that it's illegal to move livestock, ride on horses, ride bicycles, mopeds, all versions of quad bikes and all other modes of transport 

This is all roadways or *motorways*? There is a difference between ""motorways"" and ""country roads"""

293	czio29a	czj9x2c	AskReddit	"To be fair, many washing machines are different and have lots of different, crazy and seemingly similar settings with vague explanations. 

Most of my friends don't know how to use my microwave oven even though they've used their own for the past 10 years. On my microwave oven, you first have to choose the ""mode"" you want to use. For example, microwaving, heating, defrosting. If you don't do this, it defaults to some kind of strange setting that starts at 90 seconds, and I have no idea what it is. 

[I recorded a video of my crazy microwave for you guys](https://vid.me/MNzN)"	"Oh my god, so much this.  I'm studying overseas right now and living in a dorm, and some of the native students were making fun of us international students for needing to have instructions posted on the washing machines on how to use them.  They kept going off about how we're rich assholes who have never even done our own laundry before.

No!  I've been doing my own laundry for years.  I just don't know my way around the washing machines in this country!  Yes, once I figure out the buttons it's fairly simple, but they are not the same buttons on an American machine and thus it takes a few minutes the first time to make sure you have actually set the machine to clean the damn clothes."

296		dgz12tx	RPGdesign		Just my first unfounded impression -- I'm skeptical of a system like that, because it could too easily be utterly pointless or vastly overpowered. Think of Quidditch - the regular game is utterly pointless because catching the Snitch (or whatever it's called) is vastly overpowered.
297		czj7h28	GrandTheftAutoV		"As much as I know everyone hates it, lately I've been driving around in the armored kuruma purely because recently I've been heist hopping.

301	czi86ed	czjeqr7	Flipping	Is it just the Sony's that sell well? Or any portable cd player?	Sony products sell loads quicker than say Panasonic, Coby, Phillips or unknown brands. If I see a Sony cd player, I don't need to really think, I just throw it in my cart. Other cd player brands, I always check the exact model before I buy and most of the time don't end up buying. People have a very strong preference for the Sony brand over all the others.

*He pauses for a moment, thinking.*

Are you still that...that Quarian girl? Or are you someone  different, someone... new?"	"We have both the memories of when we were Quarian and when we were Geth. Although, our memories as Geth only date back to our Quarian birth, as it was found that memories from before the subjects birth increased rejection rate and subsequent death by 57.35%. We now realize that we had to be stopped. Such a waste of life...

*She takes a moment to collect herself and moves on.*

And we are both that quarian girl, and the Geth that created us. And we are neither. We... are our own being. A blend of the two that made us.

304	czijv76	czj5g10	MachineLearning	Way more than 99 percent. Fan Hui, who it readily beat in five games out of five, is ranked something among the thousand best players in the world IIRC. So at best/worst, it can only be beaten by a thousand people of many millions of players.	Based on the description though, I think Fan Hui would likely win the next best of five.  It seems he spent some moves testing the machine, plus he's used to teaching amateurs and made a mistake or two from that.

309		dkzrt6g	Monitors		"I just bought the AOC AG271QG as an upgrade from the ROG Swift PG278QR. The AOC has everything in your title for $650 (plus overclockable to 165hz), and sturdiness from metal parts. It comes in Wednesday. I'll update this comment then.

Update: The AG271QG is a great panel. You can immediately tell it's an IPS, and loaded up with Overwatch, I didn't notice any dropped frames or screen tearing. Secondly, I went to lightbleedtest.com, and found no excessive light bleed anywhere. However, the top right corner of the screen does glow more than the rest of the panel. Thus to say, it's inconsistent, but the bleed isn't horrendous. Lastly, it's designed really well. All the stand pieces are metal. I feel confident it can survive a desk bump. It also has a hook behind the monitor as a headphone holder, and there's a hole in the middle of the stand for cable management. The title is 27"" 1440p 144hz IPS G-Sync, and it sells for $650. All in all, sensational."
310	dgyssc8	dgyt561	InitialDvideos	"He went beyond youtube, he's ""big"" on twitch now. Not streaming right now but here's his link: https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985.

Basically he stopped doing youtube for his own reasons, it like became boring to him, but he still wants to do non-gaming-related projects IIRC ([further explained here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvOeZa4uvI)). He has a [second channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL7DDQWP6x7wy0O6L5ZIgxg/videos) where an editor dumps a highlight of past twitch streams. He's happy and entertains people weekly on stream, so if it works for him, all the better. He's got a girl too.

If you followed Star, the same kind of thing happened to him too, at around the same time. [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Niichts/videos), [2nd channel with highlight streams](https://www.youtube.com/user/4O4STAR/videos), [twitch](https://twitch.tv/ster)."	Yeah I know star got popular on twitch. Good to see that jerma is doing well for himself. 
311	dgynjms	dgyvn9p	StardustCrusaders	Thanks for your compliment. I guess I have ended up making a full volume cover with the new border design [here](http://i.imgur.com/x4APwiP.jpg), it is a shame that I never got to post this version here early since it took long to make it.	Yeah that is a shame, it looks really nice.
312	dgyuwed	dgyv03x	AskMen	We need another qb to take over in the next couple years, but I don't know if Dobbs is the right one. Undersized for the duel threat that he is, and has accuracy issues. Still, if the steelers can coach him up, he could be good.	Nobody is the be all end all right when they enter the NFL. Look at Brady Quinn's career for proof. Just because you were who you were in college doesn't mean your pro career will be similar. He went nowhere while pro, and even though Dobbs has shortcomings, he can absolutely be tuned to be what we need.

As long as you are keeping lines of communication open, you will find the satisfaction that you are looking for.

(Wouldn't be surprised if wrestling was 99% of all of his camps for the past few years) I really doubt Masvidal's takedown defence is going to hold up against Maia's style.

If he can get it to the ground Masvidal will have nowhere near the ""success"" there Gunnar had. (Gunnar got dominated but not submitted, I would be shocked if Masvidal lasted more than a few minutes)"	I believe in maias takedowns but i also think masvidal has good defensive bjj.

345	dkzxzzv	dkzy0cy	CasualMTG	"A good way to think of Magic cards is like this;

All cards with a mana cost are spells.

When you cast a spell, it 'releases' the spell onto the battlefield from its card, like cracking open an egg. This is why spells like [[approach of the second sun]] still trigger even if countered.

So when you use up your spell, the shell goes into the garbage (graveyard) and whatever the card had 'locked inside' is now released under your control, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

What the spell contains is not bound by the same restrictions as the spell itself.

347	cziwkqs	czj56tc	Mavenfall	"Yeah, ""if"" you have a gem draw champion, which I don't. Plus even if I did have him I'd have to make a comp with him in mind since atm he'd take a spot away from someone else. Its not like having him just magically makes everything better, it means you can build a comp that is good against/abuses the same stupid shit as the comps with Bone Knight most likely. I mean I also own Song Maiden, because everyone gets her, but she doesn't fit into my current comp, and I don't mind most people trying to play the card, I dislike the bugs associated with how the card currently works. Once he's on the field for example, Viper Slayer simply can't attack past him properly the game just freaks out and doesn't do anything correctly."	I agree, once the bugs are fixed, it'd be good to see how the card really is.

362	dkzs9q9	dkzspu2	IronThronePowers	"Regulus was content to breathe in deep and peaceful and simply enjoy the moment. The way her curls tickled his face and chest was pleasant  as was all the sensations, but something more brought him calm; the feeling of loneliness and isolation melting away in the hands of his tiny princess. How one person could do that, he did not know, but he was content for once not to question it. 

His eyes started to grow heavy but they snapped open at the sound of Helaena's voice and concern flooded his body as she spoke. Honesty? Truth that would hurt? What on earth did that mean? 

His muscles tensed unconsciously with the foreboding that filled him, but his answer was simple and honest. He was who he was. He didn't think he had the heart to lie to her. ""Of course,"" he whispered. ""Although it would pain me to see you hurt, I couldn't lie to you. Why are you so concerned?"" "	"""It's not...It's not that I'm concerned. Or that I expect you to lie, I just...""

She just needed to hear him make the promise. But that wasn't what was important here. Perhaps he would be honest, perhaps he would not. She wouldn't blame him for being hesitant in his honesty, or in lying to himself as much as her. 

She took a deep breath, and clung to him more tightly. 

""I was wed, and married for seven days. I was fond of my husband, I desired him, I enjoyed being with him. I gave him my maidenhead, and we made love every night of our brief time together.""

Another deep breath, this one shaky and uneven. She was fighting off the tears that seemed ready to fall. 

""Does that bother you? To know that I was another's?"""

374	cykcwso	czjdr49	Games	With another pretty popular fighting game, I hope this wakes NRS up to fix MKX for PC too. Netcode and optimization still an issue.	As of this, seems they've all but dropped PC development - Kombat Pack 2 might not even make PC? Nor MKXL? Netcode has been tweaked for the upcoming update, though PC purchasers are left with major outstanding issues. A really bad reflection of promised development, being heavily weighted to consoles. Even the mobile game is getting more attention.

Ordinarily one would think that this is because the OP who allegedly knew the girl wanted to remain anonymous, yet the OP fully described her occupation, work schedule, and salary [in another post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ll4rw/people_who_dont_work_normal_3540_hrsweek_jobs_and/djv80hb/)

Perhaps this is irrelevant, but I find the staggered activity on the account peculiar, particularly when the OP claims to have seen the girl and be associated with one of her friends.

think about the what the cult would want to keep hidden, or lie about. he might know how a cell is organized, but his knowledge of how to contact a cell might have been all lies. he might not know who heads the cult, or if he does, only knows them as a shadowy figure giving out kill orders. if the cult higher ups say, intend to offer up the footsoldiers to tiamat as a snack, he might not know that, because the cult would want to leave out details that might break the narrative "

I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.

That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session.

Unless, that is, they paid even *more* money to have their kids stay in the bogus class.

**TL;DR: I could only handle three days as a call-center con artist.**"

446	czjczee	czjdt4a	AskReddit	"I think it's a little simplistic to suggest that they're basically different side of the same coin, I think we're past horse shoe politics. But, yeah, I can see what you're saying about both coming across as honest, which is refreshing to anyone. In fact I think they both poll very high in people perception of their honesty. Both are also definitely playing politics. Sanders definitely avoids saying things he believes for fear of bad press. I'll give you that Sanders ""demonizes"" the rich (even if that's not what I might call it), but he doesn't fear monger people with death like Trump does with terrorists. 

Getting rid of Muslims in America is not really on par with providing tax payer funded health care, which many countries already do. First, there's the matter of scale. Health care affects practically everyone, and I can't imagine that ISIS has been involved in more than 100 American (civilian) deaths. 

Maybe this is unfair to say, you tell me. Conservatives have a higher/better fear response, and consequently, the more successful conservative politicians will be those that fear monger. I honestly don't think you can say there's an equal opposite for the left. It's a stretch to say that Sanders is advertising free health care using fear. Being on the left and having nearly my entire social circle being on the left, issues like health care and minimum wage and wealth distribution in general appeal to my peers and I because of issues of fairness and opportunity, not fear, exactly.

I also think it's inaccurate to say that Sanders is money or power hungry. Sanders came from politics and social work basically promoting fairness (whether or not you agree with that or his/the liberal interpretation of ""fairness""). Trump came from being a business man. Granted, that means he has already come from money and power, and might not necessarily be seeking it in running for president."	Sanders himself doesn't need to do the fearmongering, but leftists are always like 'if the government(taxpayers) doesn't pay your healthcare, then you'll be bankrupt after 1 ER visit!'. Still, the socialist tactic seems to be more pity based. Like those stupid sad puppy Sarah McLaughlin commercials.
447		dkznleg	DotA2		"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out.

**EDIT**
Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation: 

* Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.
* ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info!)
* Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.
* While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and *maybe* it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.
* All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead.


So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE  WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED!"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before."

452	dgz1102	dgz2dso	EliteDangerous	Small ships only sounds shit. And the amount of time in between each date is huge. 2 days to travel 500 light years? That's doable in 15 minutes. 	"The goal behind having small ships only is twofold: 1 is a very affordable expedition so many new players can easily join in, and 2 is to provide an interesting alternative to the traditional ""aspaconda"" expeditions. It gives a challenge to people to try and engineer their ass off with the small ships. It was a huge success last year (we had over 300 people register when we were expecting 50), and was a real blast. Sometimes quite literally."

"The complaints that turned me off the most were with OnePlus not the phone itself. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with. In addition, the customer support is shotty, but that can be anecdotal although it still does worry me. The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much. 

All in all, I am just trying to shop around for comparable phones and was wondering if there was something similar or more powerful than the OP5 whether the price is higher or not."

Last years Samsung Accom lasted for like *four or five months*. This one lasted for like four or five *hours* (well... ten hours, but still). \*facepalm\*"	Yes it is bs because with only 1,000 coupons and 1,026 stores there are entire stores that didn't get even one.

488	czba7se	czj6ui0	MakingaMurderer	"The problem with this theory is the profile and psychology behind Steven Avery. Killers fall into two main categories (which of course are broken down further but these are the two main differences) of organized and disorganized. This theory has SA organized one moment, and disorganized the next and switches his profile several times. 

SA is a man with an IQ in the 70's, highly disorganized as seen in his home and workplace, and has never shown any of the planning and awareness of an organized killer. 

This theory has him cleaning the gun and placing it back into it's original place,  cleaning up blood, DNA and other forensic evidence, using plastic sheeting, removing his fingerprints, being in full control in a kidnapping and he is able to fully burn a human body knowing exactly how long and what type of fire he needs. This shows SA as organized and intelligent. 

However at other times during this theory we have him bleeding all over her car and not worrying about it which shows he also wasn't wearing gloves, he decides to place the body and car on his own property even after having her in another remote off-site location, he throws keys and a license plate in a random place instead of disposing of them properly, and he leaves her spare key on the bedroom floor of his trailer. 

To make this theory fit, you have to change SA's way of thinking and personality as well as his intelligence and skill level. It just isn't plausible that at one moment he is cleaning a crime scene and the murder weapon, and the next he leaves a body in the backyard and leaves blood all over her vehicle. 

And before the arguments of who knows why killers do the things they do, or that killers are dumb and make mistakes, I do agree with this. However profiling and criminal psychology are powerful tools in investigating and forensics, and this theory just doesn't fit SA's profile. 

Also I didn't see where this theory explained the spare key on the bedroom floor or the fact that her body could not have been burned in the fire-pit. Even if you believe it was, it doesn't fit with much of the theme of an organized killer or a killer who would move her bones, as no killer would move the bones to a more obvious and persecuting location. 

Tl;DR - Steven Avery can not be Dexter Morgan one minute, and a bumbling idiot the next. 

Edit: I also want to add using his past crimes to build a profile to debunk this theory. In none of his other crimes he was convicted of (ignoring the rape for obvious reasons) he never tried to destroy or hide evidence, nor was he able to hide and food law enforcement. He never showed this sort of planning and intelligence that would be required for this theory to work. If SA did murder someone, it would be very sloppy and very obvious what he had done, and he would not be able to go for so long without slipping up and either admitting his guilt or saying something that led to his guilt.

All of them had 2 valid forms of ID, got SoCal gas utilities, and then swore under penalty of perjury that they were citizens? And they did all that without leaving even a single piece of evidence that they did it? That would have to be extremely coordinated, and if you're gonna put that much effort into it why not just get actual citizens to show up?

Don't hold back your tears. They aren't sadness, but instead a longing. A longing to be back there when we attacked life, when we were conquerers. 

Some men like us think they miss freedom and parties and ex girlfriends and young women but that's not it at all. 

What we miss is ourselves, that feeling at 16 and 18 and 21 that we were ready to take on the world, and we couldn't wait to stick our dicks into the whole world and watch it cum. Confidence for days. Chiseled abs. Pecs that made the girls gasp when we took our shirts off. We had it all but somewhere along the line it went away. We stopped fucking the whole world and it started fucking us. 

But we never stopped longing to be ourselves again, back when we had the whole world ahead of us"	Reading this awoke something inside of me. Definitely feeling some typa way right now.

523	czj6ea5	czjc661	AskReddit	"Well.... a few years ago my best friend at the time got mad at me, and went sort of crazy, for getting a boyfriend (the first guy I was actually serious about). She and I were living together (separate bedrooms) attending college and she was so weird about it that she didn't even want to be there if he was there and would leave the apartment any time he was over and text me wondering when he was gone. Keep in mind I would only see him every other weekend because he was also attending school at the time.

She started to get crazy and told various lies to my mom like I had been drinking and driving among other things when I hadn't. Oh and she told my mom I was having sex so that made things awkward. She kept feeding my mom lies and it ruined my relationship with my mom for awhile too.

She also essentially tried to turn all of our mutual friends at the time against me and became the new best friend to the person I hated most. They would search through my room and my stuff when I wasn't there too.

It sounds like something out of a Mean Girls kind of plot but it really sucked at the time. This all started right around when we moved in together so I had to deal with it for an entire year until our lease was up. I didn't find out about the room/stuff searching with my arch nemesis or her telling my mom a ton of lies until later on, but I had my suspicions. She and I have been friends for a long time but ever since that it just hasn't been the same really. We still talk and everything. Oh and I'm still with the same guy too."

539	dgyxho6	dgyzbiy	AskReddit	"Not true, what im going to say next sounds counterintuitive, but would be effective in taking the power and money out of the hands of people that wield that much power and influence.

Legalize drugs,  tax them, and take the money earned for taxing the drugs and put it toward rehab centers for people with drug problems.  Contrary to popular belief,  people who are addicted to drugs, are going to do drugs, and have much deeper problems  than the drugs they are addicted to.  If you offer them, safe, regulated places to buy and take the drugs,  you cut down significantly the amount of money el chapo is making.  

And with a national treatment center, funded by the people buying the drugs,  those people who need the help can get it.  

Those who are using them for recreational purposes will also fund the rehab centers. 

We as a society can insure those who use drugs might not die from bad drugs, and that those with real problems can get help.

Oh also,  people that control govts with drug money will be out of business and power.  

EDIT:

Winning a war on drugs in itself is an unattainable goal, as drugs will be done,  its in the nature of humans to use substances to escape stress/monotony/problems.  The war on drugs created the environment that the people OP mentioned can thrive in. If we remove that environment,  we remove them. "	The only way we win the war on drugs is to stop thinking of it as a war and start thinking of it as a social issue.

Usually this is in reference to dating. Stereotypically the asshole gets the girl, and she kicks the nice guy to the curb. The last sentence is saying that it is not the nice guys that are not getting what they want, but the boring guys. You can be nice and interesting and easily attract a mate. You can be mean and interesting and attract a mate. If you are boring and uninteresting, it doesn't matter how nice you are, you are not likely to get the mate you desire.

Once upon a time there was an 18 year old man who really *really* loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it.

Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her.

'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love.

Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well.

Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak.

The man knew what he had to do.

""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything! The wedding was saved!

""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment.

""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan.""

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Primal boss chance is the best relic stat in terms of soul farming efficiency. Other abilities that add to capped ancients are also good.

Primal chance >>>>>>> Primal souls (if Solomon under ~5k) > Double rubies (if decently active/scripting) >= Hero cost >> Primal souls (if Solomon over ~5k) > 10x gold ~= Double rubies (if not very active) >> Treasure chests > Boss life > Skill durations ~= Primal hero souls (if Solomon over ~20k) >>>>>> Other things

Primal boss chance is by far the best relic stat, and should be the main attribute you should look out for. 4% primal boss chance alone beats 3% primal boss chance with every other possible attribute at max level, for example.

604	dkzns9f	dkzx35x	Games	Not a very good defense, but the first 6-8 or so hours of the game are pretty mediocre at best. It picks up a lot after the first planet though. The game just leaves a terrible first impression.	I mean, they decided to stop the free trial right before you go underground on the first planet. If the game gets significantly better after that planet, then the free trial failed to sell me on the game. It's mediocre up to that point, and while it's not terrible, there's some weird writing choices that take me right out of the moment. The rest is just not grabbing me. Sounds like another bad decision to stop the trial before it gets good, and I don't think it's worth buying yet on blind faith until it falls under $20. And, maybe not even then.

i think that if it was on raw with maggle, jbl and byron/king i would have been completely uninterested.  the commentary team on LU is not the greatest, but striker and vampiro are reasonable good and helped me enjoy the match.  too much choreography and flippiness, which as i said is just not my cup of tea.  but solid work.

also, it helped that i had no clue what Puma's finisher would be and wasn't sure if Mundo is using his same old finisher from WWE.  so that added some element of suspense which improved the experience of the match.

it feels like it's too soon in the series to be bringing in the heel owner/authority figure storyline.  like, we don't even know the characters yet, it feels like this oculd have been a season one finale type of revelation or something, but whatever.....i'm not used to this format of seasons anyways, so i'm not going to get hung up on that.

631	dgypl53	dgyxezh	TrueAtheism	Thank you for this attitude. As a somewhat unorthodox Mormon, I always hope that people are kind when missionaries come to their door. Many of these missionaries are 18 or 19 year-olds fresh out of high school and have little or no experience with the real world. They get rejected at pretty much every door they knock on, and meeting someone who is polite, or even getting invited in, would be the highlight of their week. Certainly be up front with them about being an atheist (if you don't, they'll consider you a potential investigator and will probably come back the next week), but I'm sure they'd appreciate just talking with someone. In fact, if you're feeling extra generous, maybe offer to let them call their families. Missionaries only get to call home twice a year, so getting this offer from (gasp!) an atheist would probably do more than any religious discussion you could have.	Oh they must have me flagged as an investigator then because the Mormon girls that stopped by last time have been by like 3 times this past month. They're sweet though and like I said, I enjoy talking to them. I told them I don't believe in God when they asked the first time they stopped by, so I guess they're just trying to help me see the light. I was very religious for a long time myself so I get where they're coming from and don't feel insulted or anything like a lot of people do.

But yeah, I think in this context the unisex bathroom was a way of reducing inequality. However, I think this was only because of the accountability. We all lived on the same floor, we had an RA responsible for our safety, and if anyone had done anything sketchy it would have been noticed by the whole floor. 

I think you don't get those advantages in a truly public bathroom. Public bathrooms aren't a place where a community meets. They're composed entirely of random strangers. I think it's the anonymity that creates the danger. 

So anyway this was super rambly but I just thought I would toss out the idea that maybe not all unisex bathrooms are a bad thing (but at a museum? Yeah that's pretty unfortunate)"	Yeah, that's closer to being something like a home bathroom that gets used by all the family.

It will absolutely make for more tense combat so i totally understand the appeal, but a major portion of the time you're in the game is devoted to looting. I see being locked in first person as a huge drawback from that aspect that will make things much more tedious. I sometimes get a headache from all the camera motion when looting quickly in 3rd person... I can't imagine how bad things will be in first person only mode.

707		dkzpwv4	Parenting		My child is almost 3 now and I still have those thoughts of wanting a different life. One where I am only responsible for myself. As a stay at home mom, my entire life revolves around someone else. I don't trust others to care for him so I bring the seclusion upon myself. And while I am depressed at times I can't imagine a life without the love of my life. It may sound selfish to some but everyone is different handles things differently. So even after 3 years I still sometimes get regretful. But when I think about losing him, I bawl my eyes out and I know I would never trade what I have now.
708		czj4pe1	Sverige		"Det här är inget nytt. 

Många av de steg r/sweden tagit vad gäller reglering har syftat till att strypa debatten. Först införde man ett politikfilter, sedan osynliggjorde man röstningssystemet, sedan införde man en politikfri månad just när invandringsdebatten gick het, och sedan bannlyste man politik helt och hållet. Inga sådan åtgärder togs eller ens diskuterades när det fortfarande var vänstern som dominerade.

718		dgywsxy	NintendoSwitch		I loved gen 5 and I thnk 2d would be great but I don't see many agreeing. Some people automatically think that the 3D graphics make it better. The pro to having a 2D game would be the size as it could be larger. Also the recent 3D games have added very few Pokemon and I think a 2D  game would add many more.

721	czj1evq	czj8fsq	AskReddit	"One of my favorite moments of dialogue comes from a deleted scene where Mal and Zoe just finished losing the battle of Serenity. There's fire and dead Browncoats lying everywhere. They're waiting for help and they see ships coming.

**Zoe:** Whose colors are they flying? ... Are we really getting out?

**Mal:** We are.

**Zoe:** Thank God.

**Mal:** God? Whose color is he flying?

I really feel like this is immense character development for Mal and should never have been cut. Throughout the series they never really explain why he is against religion, and I feel like this one little clip is an extremely powerful way to justify him.

That being said, seeing that clip after watching the entire series made it a lot more powerful. I think they should've included it somewhere in the middle of the series after they've established Mal's distaste for religion."	I thought it was pretty heavily implied in the pilot that Mal was religious prior to and during the war and became disillusioned with religion after losing the war.  IIRC in the scene at Serenity Valley during the pilot they show Mal kissing a cross.
722	czimcpn	czjd2vw	AskReddit	"I was ushering my class outside for field day, and everybody is joking and having a good time, when suddenly I hear ""You Dildo!""   I pull the culprit aside and ask them if they knew what they were saying.  They said they didn't know what the word meant, and I believed them - a lot of kids that age parrot what they hear without understanding the meaning.  So, not wanting to ruin the kids's day, I talked to them about not using words we're unsure about, and had him sit out of the first two activities. No biggie, problem solved.

We're having fun with the class when the principal walks up.  The principal had been talking with the kid, and asked me why the kid was sitting out.  I explained the situation, but the principal still didn't understand what the problem was.  The principal thought dildo was referring to an armadillo.

Yup, I awkwardly explained what a dildo was to my principal."	"My mother-in-law was a teacher for a lot of years. She had a principal that didn't know what a condom was. She had confiscated some from some students for some reason and presented them to the principal, he didn't understand what the big deal about the kids having some brightly wrapped candy was.

She had to explain to him what they were."

733	dkzvpif	dkzvqkl	SquaredCircle	Didn't anticipate an Enzo promo to close out RAW tonight.	I did once I realized it hadn't happened yet and that Cass/Show was the main event... Yeesh.
734		czjfs7v	The_Donald		Hear hear!  I'm probably the one guy who likes both Bernie and Trump (though I'd vote for Bernie).
735		dkzw6r9	Overwatch		Damn this is some smoooth footage
736		czj7nx5	AskReddit		Can't find the appropriate sub, maybe ladies of reddit could point me at the right direction?
737		dkzseeh	Waxpen		Don't go higher than 8 watts and you should be good
738	czjd8x7	czjgjlq	GifRecipes	I would think the second reheat would lessen the convective tissues greatly enough to allow much easier eating. 	"What you're thinking about only comes with bbq, sous vide, and braising. The 2nd reheat would slightly warm the inside, but not to the degree that it would break down the connective tissues you'd want.

All in all, this is a waste of food and time."
739	dkzx9ql	dkzxgv9	DarkSouls2	"Totally. I'm pretty rusty at DS2 but I used to be pretty nasty at it. I admit it's a change of pace from DS3, but I had a thousand hours in SotS before DS3 came out, so I'm up for whatever. 

Assuming you meant, ""do you really want a real opponent"" and not ""do you really know what you're doing."""	"actually i meant both and also ""I don't really care about winning""

anyways if you want a tougher opponent just make a sl150 character and streamsnipe a good twitch streamer when they're in the arena"
740	dgyokxu	dgyxf2x	NintendoSwitch	"Which is why items exist so that the people in the back aren't forced to staying in the back, and the people in the front don't get to cruise along.

It's an equalizer."	You're not supposed to equalize skill, otherwise what's the point in staying in any place? That being said, just make it an option, not the default.

German is not a race retard! Germans are White. Jew is a race. Jews arent White. Get it? I explained it like youre 5.
Race is more than skin color.. how stupid are you? Are Black albinos part of the white race  because they have white skin? LOL"
744	czixh50	czj4hcg	GlobalOffensive	"when esports gets more views than ""pro skiing"""	"Her point had ZERO to do with viewership, she's not saying it shouldn't be allowed because of viewership. You're not arguing on the grounds she's established, and your point is completely irrelevant. Breaking Bad had more viewership than esports, should it be in the x-games? 

viewership doesn't define what should be in the x-games. I personally like e-sports in it, think its fine, and think everyone knows the difference between an esports medal and a snowboarding one, but I think you're argument is on the wrong grounds here. "
745		dkzrs96	AskReddit		"""no one has ever died from pot"" 

No one has died directly, car crashes, high firearm accidents and heavy machinery. Most alcoholics don't die from an overdose of alcohol they die as an indirect cause. "
746		dkzodi9	GuitarHero		frets on fire tune posting forum.

752		czj7pg4	SandersForPresident		If those are your options I suggest Vegas or Miami if possible.  Nevada is coming up after NH and will soon be in full campaign mode.   Miami would also be good because you can drive up SC before their primary after Nevada and still help with Florida canvassing after SC.  I would say move on to California from Nevada if you have time, however, California is a late primary state and there may not be much campaign infrastructure here yet.

756	dgys8pp	dgyschn	DarkSouls2	You mean your health bar? Just use a human effigy. 	No, I mean the number of total souls picked up which determines the toughness of summons and invaders. If you pick up 30,000 souls, and lose them, your soul memory is still 30,000, so your invaders and summons will be that much stronger than you.

I don't know why you're heckling me, but numerous others have pointed out ITT that the condi engineer numbers don't add up. Perhaps instead of asking me to record my memory reading DPS meters in action so anet can fix the loophole that allows me to have it working, you could do your own tests and confirm it yourself.
763	dkzqqzz	dkzqr28	PrettyLittleLiars	It really was... I feel like they should of revealed Alex 1 or 2 episodes before the finale. That way they could've made more sense and explain things more... instead of mashing everything into 2 hours..smh lol! 	"It's either should **HAVE** or should**'VE**, but never should **OF**.

764		dgywyhw	Ice_Poseidon		99% of other streamers don't fucking sit on a plane and say what airport they are at, also what gate they are at and the actual flight they are on. I love ice but he is pretty fucking dumb sometimes. 
765	dkz8vg4	dkzscc8	GlobalOffensive	And because s1mple was promised he'll be able to play whatever role he wanted and then was told he had to rifle even though s1mple was much better than koosta	I don't blame them. Simple is god tier with the rifle and the awp. Koosta is good with the AWP and thoroughly meh at rifling.
766	dkzplfa	dkzpp8v	SquaredCircle	Man maybe it's just me but I am just not a fan of Aliester Black. The 2edgy4me Shadow The Hedgehog character is just kind of lame to me. Plus his finisher is pretty underwhelming and I think it was originally Rich Swann's? Anyway, all the stuff that gets him good reactions in NXT I just can't see the larger stage audience caring that much.	To be fair, that's not a character per se. He has had an interesting life. 
767	dkzitvz	dkzr5he	Drama	"There is absolutely no evidence that Brown lay dieing in the street while the officer waited. In fact,  he was shot in the chest and twice in the head.  Evidence supports he was shot dead. What does BLM koolaid taste like?

>One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

The paramedics were actually on the scene within a reasonable time.  This  also while a unruly crowd began sweeping the scene,  they had to bring in more than 10 units just to control them,  and a swat team. 

The largest complaint about the body in the street is that locals complained the body itself was there too long while detectives rushed from other jobs to clear the scene and collect evidence,  all of this as I said with the beginnings of the riot happening.   

Edit: i just realized you don't want to talk about something that conflicts with your argument.  Lol nevermind"	"what you don;t realize I have never brought that up. We're talking about one thing, and you bring up something unrelated. We're talking about the kid who died because of meth, and here you are typing paragraphs about Brown?

Wut?"
768	dkznjw6	dkznmyr	WahoosTipi	"Yep

769		dgyvlpa	Awwducational		Is there any evidence that flying animals have fewer vestigal body parts to avoid dead weight?
770		dgyxztt	SquaredCircle		Well that happened I guess.
771	czj9636	czj9f3w	CLG	Better use of his skill? They won the split lmaoo	Well, when immortals wins with better winrates or places better at worlds, they did use bis skill better, or, you know, the other parts of his new team are upgrades.
772	dgyz6ur	dgyz88l	SquaredCircle	So, who won Y2J Vs KO?	Jericho

775	dkzwv4r	dkzyjln	DCcomics	When talking about what each character brings to the story, he said Starfire is Sci-Fi (or Sapphire in this article, whatever that means), Raven is horror, Damian is Detective stories, and Beast Boy is comedy. He's said this multiple times, and again, anyone who thinks that comedy is all Beast Boy brings to the table does not get the character.	I think the person didn't realize he said sci-fi and typed sapphire, which is honestly hilarious. I also agree on the Beast Boy thing. In the NTT, Beast Boy was a tragic character who hid behind jokes to battle his depression. All he is now is this comic relief. 
776	dgoqj3n	dgz0bvv	EarthPorn	haha I live in Lethbridge, although I do spend some time out in Aetna every now and then (very very small village near Cardston).  I *almost* managed the Thirsty Bear at one point and declined that job like an idiot.  I still wish I would've taken that.	You might have saved yourself quite the headache. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.

782		czjejah	SS13		"I remember way back when on Hippie Station, before they beefed up security. I was playing a security officer, and I remember this shift as the day the greytide went worldwide.

They stormed the brig. Broke as many windows as they could. Blew up IEDs and fuel tanks outside the brig. Stole weapons, beat officers, and thrashed security in a great grey tide. It was the day the good security died, and the shitcurity harmbatoned their way out."
783	dkztkvn	dkzxlhk	PS4	Can you expand on this please?	"(Not /u/trickdaemon, but I've played the game...)

Aiming and movement were both done on the same joystick. I actually prefer it, since the grappling hook is how you do most of your movement anyway, but people whined, as they're wot to do. So now there's a dual-stick option.

The game is great, but challenging. I picked it up on day one and have put about a dozen hours into it. Look up a video of the opening cutscene and tell me you're not pumped!"

795	dgyn59z	dgz09c9	CFB	One of the big benefits of getting a bunch of commits now is you can get these guys to bond with each other early on. That can be a major help in getting guys to stick during the ups and downs of the season. 	Exactly... plus these are kids that make lives in college. Freshman year is when you build that foundation of friends you're going to have in college (I mean kids you meet a few months in, not those first 10 weirdos you happen to meet -- I still love those weirdos btw) and perhaps forever. It's hard to just transfer to a different school, I feel like you have to feel super neglected on the field *and* have a bad college life to decide to leave.

I am printing boat and canoe hulls with the keel down, default Cura supports and it almost looks like a little shipyard. It's easy to see entire ship hulls being 3D printed in the future. The Navy wants to do 3D printing on the go, especially things like 3D printed underwater surveillance quadcopters, print on board, deploy along the way, it returns, dumps data.

Didn't help almost my whole family is white collar women with business degrees. I actually make more in salary than they do and have ten years experience, but for whatever reason my family considers this a waste of potential and that I'm a dead beat because of it. I work seasonally on an island as a sous chef and co-run a successful food truck/waitress at a high end restaurant in the off season. I have a life I can afford and travel with, a great social life and I want for nothing.

I'm happy and don't consider that a waste."	I made the mistake of going against my gut and becoming a corporate guy. I think I'm still young enough to turn it around. And, while it wasn't all a waste, it was a waste. 
799		dkzsrrp	Smite		"Early game: khepri has better clear and lane pressure, along with a stronger level 1-4. Get suffers in the early game due to lack of clear and pressure, since the shield is garbage early. If you are looking for a snowball duo lane then pick khepri over geb. 

Mid game: khepri's mitigation becomes very useful, and his pull can guarantee a kill. Geb shield starts to come online and can provide better peel  

Late game: here is where the 2 gods separate in role. Geb has a much better initiation and can set up team fights and picks more easily than khep. Khepri is better at extending team fights because of his ult and can provide better late game peel from the root/pull, where as geb can guarantee more survivability. 

Conclusion: both gods are top tier supports. They both provide different things to a team comp and can be picked on preference. I think it is very ignorant for you to say that khepri is bad since he has one of the biggest pick ban rates in the spl and can change a team fight in many ways. If you are looking to snowball out of the duo lane pick khepri. If you want to farm until late game pick geb. They both do their role well, and because of that u can't say that khepri is bad. Kuzembo is a bad support because he lacks everything. Sure u can say that one is bad compared to the other but that doesn't make him unpickable which is what u seem to be saying. "

I dunno for some reason strangers make up violent crimes that I've committed."	"&gt;Except the only hate group here... is people who hate video gamers. What don't you understand about that?

Everything, because it's total and complete bullshit. No-one has done anything to you, but your group has terrorised women for a year and half. Don't try and pretend to me it didn't happen, I've watched it happen. I watched gamergaters publish the addresses and phone numbers of my friends to intimidate and threaten them. I still see it every day.

&gt;I dunno for some reason strangers make up violent crimes that I've committed.

You fly the flag of a group and you have to answer for what it does. You can't just say ""no I'm one of those moderate KKK members"".

Look, you seem to be working very hard to create this pretence that you did nothing wrong. It's not gonna work, you know what you did.

The good news though is the internet is anonymous. You can just walk away and leave your victims alone, and the only person you'll have to lie to is yourself."

I don't have a pack in the powder room, there's just no place for it. After seeing all the responses I think I'll figure out some way to include a pack. Just in case.

I agree they have an incredible network and the disruption they've brought to the table is noteworthy, but I just don't see them as a great value long term. Netflix doesn't have any capabilities outside of its core business, and to me there is no huge distinction between the value Netflix provides in its original content versus that provided by Hulu and Amazon.

I find myself using Hulu more and more nowadays, and Amazon has the advantage of rolling a ton of value into the prime membership, versus Netflix offering you a very narrow service.

I don't think Netflix is a bad company and I use and enjoy their service. I just think that they are insanely inflated in value."	But fang...

I had wanted to learn for years but always let myself be convinced that I was too old to start learning.

After finishing the show, I decide if a klutz like Yui could pick up the instrument, so could I. I've been playing for about a year and a half now but only started taking lessons with a good teacher about four months ago.

939		czj8dpo	Aquariums		"This is a Finnex 12x12x12 cube that came with a Planted+ light.  I had this tank set up before, and had issues with algae (the light is strong for the tank, and sits very close to the top.)  
  
I wanted to add some snails to the tank, and wanted a lid to keep them from escaping.  I also wanted to slow evaporation (I have very hard water, and hate the calcium lines I get), and keep the bubbles from the sponge filter from popping and splashing on my monitor.  
  
I went through a couple samples and tests and ended up with this.  It was printed with PET+ (basically same stuff plastic water bottles are made up of) which is hydrophobic - so I'm not too concerned about toxins or breakdown.   Pretty happy with the results.

944	czjf6t5	czjf9u6	DestinyTheGame	"My wish list for the Crucible:

• Double the spawn time of special and heavy. 
• Add just a little more flinch to snipers.
• Reduce aim assist on all snipers.
• Bring Thorn's damage in-line with legendary weapons. The DoT should be what makes it exotic, but it shouldn't do so much extra damage. 
• Bring TLW's damage more in-line with legendary weapons. This thing is way too strong. 4 body shots for a kill, and 2 to the head (hipfire). This thing shoots faster than MIDA and doesn't even require headshots for a fast time to kill. Reduce the extra damage. 
• Since TLW gets bonus damage while hipfiring, shouldn't First Curse at least get some sort of bonus damage while First Curse perk is active? Why can TLW kill someone with max armor in 2 shots, but First Curse can't? (Assuming TLW doesn't get nerfed.)
• High impact auto rifles need crit damage increased. Higher impact autos should have the farthest range as well. 
• Focus Fire perk on high impact autos should make crits at a minimum of 39, and not the current (33).
• High impact pulse rifles should be restored to their former damage. 
• Fusion rifles should be effective outside of shotgun range. I'd say about double the range is good. Tightening stability goes hand to hand with effective range. 

I know it's a pretty ridiculous list, but I think I'd actually be able to enjoy the Crucible if these changes were implemented. We *need* variety. I'm just tired of being killed by the same six weapons every game. TLW, Thorn, MIDA, 1000-Yard, Party Crasher, and Harrowed Quillim's Terminus.

Edit: Of course I get downvoted because nobody agrees with a TLW rebalance. I've been on the receiving end of that weapon for a year now and I can say that I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was already perfectly balanced. "	"I think these are all good except the TLW nerf. It's a shell of its former self, and it just straight up dies outside of, like, twenty feet. I never feel like I've been unfairly killed by it any more. If I get melted, I had it coming.

If it gets nerfed again, it becomes unusable, and I don't think that's necessary."

It's obviously worth it since I was at zone ~3500 after a year before transcendence and my HZE is now 25k+. To speed things up, before you transcend try to have a mercenary quest for 10+ relics complete, 50 or 100 rubies saved for quick ascensions and at least 1 clan boss reward but I go for 2.

After you transcend, hit 1 quick ascension and go for the ancients you want, if you don't get any of them hit another quick ascension hoping that you can get the ancients you want. Then collect the relic quest reward and equip the helpful ones if there are any, then use your Ancient Souls, don't forget to use them!

958	dgynpw2	dgyz9js	TrueReddit	"Oh, wow.  There are so many things, that it is hard to narrow down.

First would be manners, those raised in middle class families usually have a much greater understanding of propper manners, how to dress, how to act, when not to use vulgar language, appropriate things to talk about, etc.

A huge one, though, would be *frugality*, which I think is an entirely middle class ideal.  All to often those from lower class homes, even when making decent money, would be ""rich on Friday, broke on Monday."". The idea of being frugal and saving money is not common.  Usually those, in my personal experience, from the bottom of the spectrum where those most likely to buy expensive electronics, clothes, cars and such rather than saving.  Another example is that in my early twenties, I knew two types of people who would go blow $300+ at a nightclub:  rich kids from wealthy families, and poor guys from poor families without education.

An intangible difference is a feeling of dissatisfaction.  As I was working and poor, I knew I was poor, and I knew I had to do something about it.  I had an idea of how it should be.  I could not imagine trying to have children or other things while in that situation that would hinder me improving.  For those who have never seen better, the first time they had any amount of income above living hand-to-mouth, they considered themselves well off.

I know this sounds kind of arrogant, it is not my intent to blame people for being poor, but these differences are apparent, and it is likely because those raised in the lowest social and economic classes do not have a concept of how others act.

Also, I believe in general, most all of the poor people on reddit are more similar to myself, even if they have poverty or working class level income, they likely have a middle class background and a good portion are educated, though perhaps with useless degree and a heap of debt.  Socially, though, this site is in vast majority middle class."	"&gt; All to often those from lower class homes, even when making decent money, would be ""rich on Friday, broke on Monday.

I think about it in terms of food. If you're poor, when you get your paycheck you don't think ""Wow, now I can buy two months worth of rice and beans"".

No. It inflates your psychological (and literal) appetite so you crave steak."

I was at the eighth grade dance. I didn't have very many friends in middle school, so I was just kind of dancing by myself in the center of the mash. I hear from behind me a loud ""Yeah, Adam!"" and I turn around to see its the girl I had had a crush on for basically the entire year. Before this moment, I don't think I'd even had a conversation with her. We make eye contact, and she turns around, pointing her butt in my direction, an obvious invitation to grind (yes, it was one of those dances, the whole thing was a disgusting mess. Of course, I didn't think so at the time). Now, I had been a fairly sheltered kid. I had no idea why she was doing that or what I was supposed to do. She dancing a little, going up and down, looking back waiting for me to do something. 
Then it dawned on me, I knew exactly what to do. 

I turned my back to her, backed up into her, and we rubbed backs for a solid ten seconds. She turned around with the most wtf look on her face and disappeared into the mob of people. 
We never spoke or saw each other again, and I'm glad we haven't."

Well, I'm sorry my opinion gives you a false perception about me - I suppose what I find annoying is different than what you find annoying. "	"I was only trying to help. I fear you've posted a question without preparing yourself for an honest answer and criticism. 

Seat belts can be ""annoying"" when I'm trying untangle myself to reach something in the back seat, but I don't not wear it or complain about something that will literally save my life if the worst case scenario happens."
1018	dgyt0e1	dgyyg8z	AskReddit	"I received a letter after donating blood years ago with a big PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL and IMPORTANT on it. Letter states I had a false positive on the necessary HIV screening. It had huge markers insisting I did not have HIV but they were required to notify me. 

Apparently certain auto-immune diseases (which I have) can cause the pre-screen to test false positive but after all additional testing, they confirmed it was negative. Considering I had no risk factors besides medical procedures, it was a huge heart attack day for me. Took a while for me to calm down and a few more blood tests. "	"That sort of thing sort of says ""FUCKING OPEN IT"" to most people who aren't the intended recipient. "
1019	dgyuwk4	dgyz4u4	MMA	Not sure why it's called an oblique. Maybe that's where the kick is usually thrown in that that boxing. I do know that it differs from a side kick in that the toes face to the outside of the kicker instead of towards the inside.	"&gt;Not sure why it's called an oblique.

Same here, oblique sort of means ""at a slanted angle"" and I think oblique kicks are unique because you connect while the knee is still bent."

1036	czj22wl	czj7tcw	Python	"The hashes do not come from the server.

PyPI displays (unsafe, unreliable MD5) hashes of packages, but that is not used in any way by this feature of pip. What's going on here is that you, the end user of pip, will manually obtain a known-good copy of the package you want, compute the SHA-256 (or other stronger hash of your choice, so long as `hashlib` supports it) hash of it, and put that hash in your requirements file. Then pip can -- locally, on the machine pip is running on -- compute the hash of the package it downloads, and compare to what you provided. If it matches the hash of the known-good package, installation succeeds. If it doesn't match, installation is aborted.

So while it's not full-on package signing (which would be nice but requires a whole different kind of infrastructure), it does give you the tools to avoid ""malicious index server giving me a bad package"" problems, so long as you're using it responsibly.

(also worth noting that PyPI does actually support signed uploads -- I do this with all my personal packages, and Django has been doing it for years -- but the end-user package-installation toolchain doesn't have the infrastructure to do full web-of-trust verification of those, hence my parenthetical in the above paragraph; if you're interested, click [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.9.1) for example and scroll down to the file list; you'll see both the display-only MD5 hashes of the files, and links labeled 'pgp' which are the signatures for those files)"	"&gt; PyPI displays (unsafe, unreliable MD5) hashes of packages, but that is not used in any way by this feature of pip. 

*Not by this feature, but pip does check that the hash given in a fragment of the package download url (which will be the same as that displayed on the page) matches that which it calculates on the package downloaded. This is purely file-integrity checking."
1037		dkzqeyo	AskReddit		"We adopted a cat a few months ago, so we're still getting to know him. He's about 18 months old, give or take. When we brought him home, he seemed like a regular cat, but we quickly realized that he's super smart. 

He can open our shutters; he works a paw between two of the louvers and pushes them up or down until the whole shutter is open, so he can watch the birds in the backyard. 

We've got a wall niche where he loves to hang out, so he's up off the floor. There are light switches on one side, and after seeing someone turn on a light ONCE, he pawed at the switches. Of course he got a reaction from us, so now he regularly plays with the switches to make us laugh. 

Any door or drawer that is even half a centimeter open is likely to end up being opened and investigated. He's ended up in some pretty interesting hideouts. 

He's amazing at playing fetch -- his favourite toys are pompoms from the dollar store, but he'll retrieve just about anything if he's in the mood. 

He knows what birds are -- if you say there are birds in the backyard, he'll go to the window to watch (his favourite thing). Better yet, if I grab my laptop and ask him 'want to watch birds?' he will start meowing, then run over to curl up in my lap and watch a youtube channel I found that shows birds and squirrels at a feeder (it's actually designed for cats to watch when owners aren't home). 

When we realized how bright he was, I decided to deliberately train him to do some things, to keep his mind busy so he wouldn't be bored and wreck the house. Within two weeks he had learned to 'come', 'sit', 'beg', 'shake a paw', and 'gimme five' -- he's a cat, so he'll only work for treats and only if he's in the mood, but it's still astonishing to me that he's so incredibly trainable. 

Edit -- I forgot his best 'trick'; he saw one of us turn on one of the roombas, and because he LOVES to chase them around he figured out that he could push the button on top twice in a row and make the vacuum start up any time he chose. Now every once in a while we'll hear him take off downstairs and pounce on the vacuum so he can stalk it. People tend not to believe us until they see him do it, but he seems to like to show off this particular trick for guests. Several times now we've been visiting with someone in the living room and the cat will just appear... meow... swat the vacuum... then deliberately paw the button. My mother-in-law went nuts, she just couldn't believe it -- 'that wasn't an accident, he had to push the button two times! Oh my god! You need to get that on video!' We're definitely going to try, but it's tough since most of the time he does it at 1am when we're asleep! :D  "

Timeless games, backwards compatability from the previous station every time (GBC-GBA, GBA-DS, DS-3DS, 3DS-Switch, Game Cube-Wii, Wii-WiiU), and from my own personal experience great customer support. "	"How do you even buy a Switch from Nintendo? Walmart and Best Buy don't carry them. Amazon has them at twice retail from scalpers but Nintendo doesn't actually sell them at retail. 

It was pretty messed up how they botched the NES Classic. But at least the Raspberry Pi exists, and RetroPie.

Still wouldn't say they're evil, but they're not very pro-consumer. I'm just glad Breath of the Wild is 'out there' and Cemu is being actively developed. I want a Switch, but there are some major issues Nintendo needs to address before I can consider one."

1085	dkzf4dl	dkzoxwm	AskReddit	"By that measure then, the Persians never lost to the Greeks when they invaded Greece.  They simply didn't win.  You can very easily see from the point of view of those being invaded how it would seem like a victory.  

The US invaded a British colony, got defeated and repelled, got pushed back on all fronts, and was forced to sue for peace.  That seems like a pretty clear cut British victory to me."	The Greco-Persian wars are a lot more complex than how your presenting them, by the Greeks did actually gain from the end of the war due to the establishment of Greek colonies throughout Anatolia.
1086	dgz19rq	dgz1fhq	Libertarian	owner not author.	Owning something doesn't mean you have the rights to distribute it for profit, those rights belong to the author (unless given away).  If intellectual property laws were removed, everyone would have full rights to distribute and so anyone could call themselves the author.
1087	dkznv3r	dkzqow2	StardewValley	"I had the opposite experience last night. The lady with the cart had cookies. I have gestational diabetes and have to ignore all my cravings. When I saw the cookies I was like ""omg! She has cookies!"". I spam clicked to purchase all the fucking cookies and wasted a bunch of money and then realized: wait..these are not real cookies, I cannot eat them."	"Oh nooooo!! That's like dreaming it's Friday and waking up to find it's Monday! Will you be able to eat cookies when your term is up? My piano teacher had a major issue when she was expecting and for the second half of her term couldn't eat anything with fat...basically. I think she was on a straight like...lettuce diet. 

The good news is, you can do what I do, IRL...which is give the cookies away to people to make them like you. 

...wait....did you say lady? I thought that was a dudebro."

As a note, amendments aren't accomplished by voting on bills, but rather by Congressional voting on an amendment proposal, and then it being handed to the states for a referendum."
1090		dkzw7ak	CODZombies		I love shadows and playing public matches too. It would definitely have better games but i love watching what develops in random games. Shadows is great for this, for example (Im generalizing like a mofo rn) noobs will learn/do the civil protector over pack a punch and sometimes the shield. Camping by the box in footlights is the popular place to be. And of course due to the lack of pap for them the raygun is actually something they want. 
1091	dkytbjr	dkzw3q8	OutOfTheLoop	You can get better pasta from take-out pizza joints... let alone actual restaurants.  Want inexpensive soup/salad/breadsticks -- hard to beat i guess.	Yeah, the draw for most people is the unlimited soup/salad/breadsticks thing I think.

1095	czj8bqr	czj8d3g	CasualConversation	I play the...piano/synth, guitar, bass, djembe, cajon, melodica, ukulele. I think my favorite is the melodica 'cause it looks so weird when I play it in public. The best use of melodica for me is in the acoustic version of [Der Kleine Vampir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p72mFG9DchI) by We Butter The Bread With Butter	Do you watch the Late Show w/ Colbert?  His band leader plays a melodica all the time.
1096	dkzobgl	dkzoya3	DnD	"If your party is expecting you to soak up damage, then absolutely; however, if you have the lowest hit points in the party that's probably not necessary. If you have another idea for a feat that would let you be an effective member of the party in a supportive role, it sounds like your team will be meaty enough to allow it.
That said, if you'd like to be in the thick of combat you should take tough."	"I think i can handle the damage with the Lay on hands, plus the fact i have an adamantine plate armor that will help me in case of crits, so i probably won't fall that easy on battle.
And thanks for helping!"
1097	czj6eon	czj6i19	MassEffectPhoenix	Yeah... first boyfriend, died in the Hammer invasion. 	Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
1098		dgywc69	SquaredCircle		So who decides when this match ends? Was Orton being crushed by a fridge the end? 
1099		dgyx814	MSLGame		Rng.  I usually get at least 1 per refill. Granted it's usually flat or rec%
1100		czj4zwg	Kanye		Level 22, It suddenly got way harder on that one, I'd never heard of almost all of them
1101	dgysjwg	dgyu7el	HappyWars	"Just because you challenged us months before dont mean SHIT lol.. 

first of all it usually takes awhile to really get everyone on, n as i said several times, i made SURE that PTC was going to play the devs, that was top priority..along with wanting to get neeg to play, which the hours he got on was always different...n when we did play...it was fucking random...wasnt scheduled..lol..if that had happened earlier, we would've..but around that time, was time, because we had just got done smacking the devs..

REGARDLESS..you STUPID FUCKS trying to use that as any leverage?? ""it took months""

SO FUCKING WHAT??? WTF does that have anything to do with?

so that gives u the right to play one game?? and dip, and NEVER come back to the system??

u call yourself a great player?? play ONE MAP?? if you are GREAT, you should know..a FUNDAMENTAL thing..such as different maps, is different strategies..

We all played warrior...LOL...did this kind of out of tactics..i wanted to say we beat u guys with all warriors..but the lag was more then expected...Han n Atom both using dash attack warriors??

point is, we did things i knew we shouldnt have...BUT i knew, when shit hit the fan..if we didnt win the first game..then shit was going to get changed up...dash attack warriors..vs laggers..like shaymin, n pInda..n jin...are USELESS..

i didnt care, it not like i wanted to lose the game..but i knew, that if set up correctly, we would have a better chance of winning...i wasnt going to lose the match...but i wasnt showing all the cards..im to tactical for you to get...to wise

PTC was better, YES i can say that..and more legit

Noble, including yourself WAS a bunch of cowards..and i say this, because of your own doings.. n your lack of acknowledgment of how u, and ur team approached the game..

you started playing with AKira because he was good??? LOL???

COME ONE NOW

How about Pinda???

Jin?? he was just a real good mage!!! he wasnt laggy at all!!!

LOLOLOLOL 

shaymin? one of the laggiest 1v1 warriors EVER??

supernice?? a brick wall

defending YOU...one of the laggiest players EVER..

all you laggers..surrounded yourself around other fucking laggers..

and you KNEW IT..

STOP acting like you didnt know LOL..you aint that fucking stupid...u just dont want to accept it...n mad because i brought it to the proper attention..

that is because if u or anyone gona sit there, n say Noble was the best...LOL its just laughable..when putting everything into consideration..

IM the best player ever...I KNOW legitimatizes... where YOU obviously dont

Think about all the players i mentioned in Noble..all the laggers...jin, shaymin, you, pinda, supernice, akira, oooalmightyoo (when he switched, didnt switch with us)

along with SEVERAL other laggers..that i forget their names..

and then...you add the Japs???? LOL which was basically Noble...???

everyone of those players, are laggier, then PTC's laggiest player...

PTC laggiest player, woulda been less laggy then Nobles least laggiest player...

the lag wasnt in comparison..

PTC was as legit as you're going to get on a team...aside from when you joined..lol....but u were put to use against other laggers, so it was a trade off to some degree

Im always logical, always rational, but when you miss simple shit, i become irrational with ignorance..

when you KNOW how u approached the game in comparison to me...

you KNOW the amount of lag you played with on your team

this is a good word for you...

COMFORT...you KNOW when you have that type of lag, it gives u a COMFORT..

that is why we couldnt play with Goosie any more...or at least couldnt have him push...because his lag...was to comfortable..to easy..u give me laggers like that??

just isnt fun...in a group..?? u know this comfort level im talkin about..

and u ignoring it...and not accepting it...is why i emphasize on the word coward..

ALL these things into consideration..

then..

you play us...in...One...

game.....

not a match...so dont say MATCH..remember now...its cowardess to not acknowledge simple things.. (as we just went over)

a GAME..

think of it like this...

boxers, schedule fights..months ahead of time...more then months..

it would be like fighting a third of the fight..the first 3 rounds out of 12...and be up by points...and leaving the arena...and being like

""Im the best ever"".. when he was barely winning...

where is the LOGIC in that??

it is STUPID that i have to explain this..

not acknowledging this..is ALSO cowardess..im trying to prevent u..from falling into cowardess train of thoughts..realize when you know you have done wrong, in what ever way it may be...accept it..and learn from it..

U can NOT argue..that Noble was as good...n sure as fuck not better...when u played ONE game...and Noble NEVER came back to the console...EVER AGAIN

I KNOW you got tired of me saying im the best...im the best...so u started saying Noble was the best...

but u forget..THEY ABANDONED YOU..lol...like???????


??????

n NEVER came back...supernice in that party...said something along the lines of 

""im never coming back again""

u can NOT compare yourself to someone, or a team...when you RUN SCARED...LOL...

THAT is ILLOGICAL...

there is no rebuttal here..Furthering defending what Noble did, and what Noble was...is just pathetic...not accepting fundamental shit..

N on top on it...LOL

WRITE MUSIC, IN SO MANY WORDS, CONFIRMED BASICALLY ALL OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING....

n HE was the MAIN GUY in NOBLE..LOL..


AT LEAST HE ACKNOWLEDGED...ACCEPTED....AND NOW RESPECTS

the words of WISDOM, the words of TRUTH that i speak...

i put to much time into the game..i have to good of a understanding..

that aside...what Noble did...is blatant...BITCH shit...plain n simple...

PTC was a REAL team...pretty much the only real team the game ever had..lol...

#Logic+rational=Strapz"	"Write Music was the main guy in Noble.... Far from. If anyone was the true leader of the clan it was Super Nice and me and him co lead it. 

Stop trying to suck up to him, just because he's essentially telling you what you want to hear. It's what I used to say you did with Dragz. You overate him as a player so much. It's because he was a big part (even essential) in creating the modern PTC. 

Write music simply told you that noble is filled with cowards.... so what 1 person (who btw hardly played with noble) now proved everything. Ever thought about how he clearly has a grudge with me?? It's why he said all that stuff. 

You completely overate how laggy Noble was while discrediting PTCs lag. 

You fine well know inspire, steez, Dragz, Han and keytro have been called laggers time and time again. 

You also have NO IDEA. who was in Noble. If your going to take 1 thing from this stop telling me who was in noble. Japs didn't play with NOBLE. I used to play with japs along with Dragz and supernice.... BEFORE NOBLE. 

Almighty was never in noble. 

Pinda wasn't either. 

Also you don't understand how people like Akira came into the clan. Of course he wasn't recruited. But it was when Titan split up. Players got thrown around, people's were friends etc. You couldn't split everyone up. Noble black was nobles top 8 players. That 8 has as much lag as your top8

Straps stop trying to discredit me. It's ridiculous. You fine well know what you said to me while in PTC. about how people overate my lag. Y don't you make a fuss about inspire?? He used to lag TERRIBLY and you knew it. 

You had months to fight noble. MONTHS it does not take that long to set up a match. If both parties want to play a match, regardless of time zones/jobs/school. The time can be found. I've played enough clan matches to know. 

Noble or PTC were not better than each other. 

There were weak links and carry players. 

PTC was nothing without you, me of steez. SS was right they absolutely would of beaten PTC without those 3 players. Same with Noble of it wasn't for me and Supernices defence the clan would of been nothing, obviously would of been a great clan, but the best? no. 

So forget the clans. The clans don't hold any value really. 

I didn't get tired of you saying you were the best. It was your constant discredit of Noble. Most of the stuff your saying straps isn't true. Of course noble had lag like pretty much everyone. but it was exaggerated, exactly the same with PTC. 

Noble was NOT a clan when we fought. It's the same question, why was flukes PTC when we clan matched??? because Noble wasn't a clan that's why. "

The two then talked about how each other had been and played but the major moment of talk when Tawn explained that he lived in a box when he was younger. After that, he noticed Amethyst's weapon and showed her he used something similar in the form of a sharpened wrench that he made for ranged capabilities. Their social short comings kept them from connecting until they played. After a short round of roughhousing that left Amethyst unable to move on the floor. The two talked about their experiences and lead Tawn to invite Amethyst to a pasta night with him and his team after giving her one of his sharpened wrenches that the girl was enamored with earlier.

*****
&gt; Ivanka Trump, the president&amp;#039;s daughter, and Jared Kushner, her husband, had pushed the president to hire Mr. Scaramucci, seeing him as a way to force out Mr. Priebus, the former national Republican committee chairman, and his allies in the West Wing.In that, Mr. Scaramucci was successful.

&gt; Mr. Scaramucci&amp;#039;s swift departure is an early indication that Mr. Kelly intends to assert his authority over the operations of the White House, and that several of the big personalities there - including Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump and Mr. Bannon - may be inclined to defer to him.

&gt; The president still values Mr. Scaramucci, according to people close to Mr. Trump and his family, and is hoping to find another, less high profile, position for him in the White House - although it is uncertain if Mr. Scaramucci would be willing to accept a demotion.

I could launch into a nice long paragraph describing the history of Public Housing policy in the United States, how urban tenements first gave rise to building codes, and the first public housing projects. How these projects failed when they became to grand in size and scope, which lead to alternative policies such as use of section 8 tax credits to try and increase the supply of affordable housing, which eventually culminated in Mortgage Backed Securities being pitched as a tool that would allow lenders to serve clients they otherwise wouldn't touch, because other banks were willing to absorb that risk, and thus these lenders wouldn't be as leveraged and could afford to write more loans, and give those loans to middle class people who otherwise could never afford a proper down payment.

The thing is, I find these super polarized people like you on reddit to be laughable. You are no different than these Trumpettes screeching that Orange Mussolini can do no wrong. Basically, you believe the world is completely black and white, and that all banks are evil, and everything is the fault of corporate greed. It is a fucking joke. Reality isn't a movie. The truth is most people in that industry are good, morally sound, hard working people. Sure, there are individual instances of greed and douchiness, which you could find in every industry. If you want to actually have a serious conversation about the multitude of systemic structural flaws that led to the Sub Prime Mortgage crisis that is a conversation that can be had, but having it with the Occupy Wall Street hippie crowd that not only doesn't even understand what the banking industry as a whole does, but just wants to point fingers and screech platitudes, well that isn't going to be very productive.

1212	dgygtr6	dgyt87e	OverwatchCirclejerk	[verwijderd]	"A guardian angel to those who come under her care, Dr. Angela Ziegler is a peerless healer, a brilliant scientist, and a staunch advocate for peace.
After obtaining her MD and PHD in Switzerland, Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.

Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.

During her Overwatch years, she once dressed as a witch for Halloween.

Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. One example was the development of the biotic rifle by Torbjörn. Torbjörn provided assurances that the device was only intended for healing, but Ziegler maintained that this was setting Overwatch down a road that could lead to the weaponization of biotic technology, and that she had only conducted research in the field on the condition that it would not be used for offensive purposes.

Seven years before the present day, Ziegler was involved in an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander Jack Morrison to end the King's Row Uprising in London, England. Earlier the same day, Ziegler argued with Morrison over Overwatch's inability to intervene in the conflict due to the English prime minister expressively forbidding of any Overwatch action within the United Kingdom. Dr. Ziegler expressed her concern for the thousands in the city who needed medical aid, and lamented how Overwatch was made to help people, not sit on the sidelines. After Jack authorized the mission, while preparing to board an aircraft, Ziegler welcomed Cadet Lena Oxton to the team. She commented on how her inspirational words convinced Jack to authorize the mission, and how he was very invested in her career, and had asked Ziegler to keep an eye on her. Zigler then told Oxton how she could call on her if she ever needed any help.

In Overwatch's final days, the group was faced with a series of allegations, and Ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the United Nations. In light of the fight between Overwatch members Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, Ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable. They had drifted further and further apart ever since Morrison had been chosen over Reyes for the position of strike commander, and that rift had widened despite her efforts.

Mercy helps the innocent
When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by war. Though she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled, hoping to make a more peaceful world.

When Winston issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Mercy was in the Middle East. Mercy was unsure if Overwatch should be restored.

Hope that helps.

1219		czj5z1f	HaircareScience		Don't desparage. It took me years to get my rotine down, but it is possible to resolve an itchy scalp. When my scalp gets flanky/itchy....I will actually lose sleep and when I did sleep, I'd scratch my scalp till I'd find blood under my fingernails. I've gone to dermatologists, removed sulfate shampoos, tried natural ingredients  (tea tree, neem oil, etc), tried salicylic acid shampoos, coal tar shampoos, the zinc compund head and shoulders uses, selenium sulfide shampoos....the whole friggin gambit. Here's what works for me: first thing, i never wash my hair the same way twice. Mixing it up somehow helps. My shower looks like a crazy person's because I use so many different products in rotation. Then I do a multi-step process that seems to work. First I use a generic shampoo in a quick and dirty way that kind of breaks up the oil in my hair. Then I use a salicylic acid shampoo (dermarest, specifically.) The chemical exfoliation helps the next step work better. Then I rotate between a 4% rx ketakonazole shampoo, coal tar shampoo and head and shoulders. Hope this helps.

I sorta wished id planned ahead but it was fun searching whilst knowing I was running out of time.

1309		czja7dc	LearnJapanese		"So I've found this post about the same topic, discussed from a Japanese speaker's point of view:

http://cpplover.blogspot.jp/2012/12/blog-post_18.html

There's a link to this /r/anime thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14z01e/looking_for_instances_of_an_often_used_quote_that/c7hqldn

Which leads us to this /r/bestof thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14zw76/alayavijnana_explains_the_meaning_behind_the_he/

I don't have the time to read all these posts so here's my answer.

殺す is 'to kill' and 死ぬ is 'to die.'

「彼は殺しても死なない」 literally means ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""  

You will find translations like ""You couldn't kill him if you tried"" because the English sentence I gave above apparently doesn't sound natural.  Literal translation would still be ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""

The Japanese sentence 「彼は殺しても死なない」 is as self-contradictory as ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him"" but somehow feels natural.  In short, I think it's more about what kind of a sentence feels natural rather than the implications of the words 殺す/kill and 死ぬ/die.

I haven't thought this through but this might somehow be related to the ""Japanese doesn't have sarcasm"" trope.   Or I might be completely off the mark.  I must go out now...

When I was training as a runner one night, I was going with my FTO to relieve someone for a break. I had left my water sitting on top of the water cooler in that POD. When we entered the POD, I saw my cup slide off of the water cooler, hang in the air for a split second, and splash onto the ground. I turned and saw my FTO who looked unnerved, so I asked him if he saw that? He told me, ""I didn't see shit, Dude."" He refused to talk about it after that.
One time when I was a runner for the building our isolation unit was in, I heard the bars shaking in one of the units. It was after lockdown, so I was a little perturbed by this inmate making noise. So, I pulled my keys, unlocked the cell, and saw the bars shaking, but the inmate cowering in the corner crying. After a couple of seconds, the bars stopped shaking. I hung out with the inmate for a while calming him down. I made up some bs about how we had water pipes that were causing the bars to shake. Unfortunately, that cell was pretty notorious for being ""haunted."" 
Finally, me and several other runners were called out to search the building for someone who was seen entering our visitation lobby around 11:30 pm. I checked the only doors going into the lobby and they were fully secured. We searched for a good 30 minutes, even climbing into the false ceiling, and never found a person matching the description given."	That's crazy stuff! Thanks for sharing.

Hence the **point** of gradual ban time increase. idk how many times I have to explain myself. seems like the only ones being stuck up are the ones that have crashing problems. you guys should spend more time coming up with a fix and mess time arguing this great ban idea 	"I only said you seem like a prick because you're asking ""what is wrong with you people,"" as if we are at fault for not wanting people to be unfairly banned. 

This just isn't a good idea. You have to attack the problem at it's core. Rage quitters are not the issue you are trying to address here. It is salty/toxic players. 

For example, you miss a save. Your teammate ""what a saves"" you and votes to forfeit. You don't vote and so he just leaves. That player is clearly willing to give up 15 minutes. If we include some time of increasing time length ban and that person then isn't willing to give up 2 hours (or whatever) of time, in all likelihood they're just gonna stay and be toxic. Play against you. Drive around aimlessly. Talk trash in chat etc. Is that any better than if they had just rage quit? You have to understand that if someone who doesn't want to play is forced to play, in most cases they aren't really gonna try to play productively and win. Additionally, we can't forget about what will happen to all the people who have an unfortunate week of power outages, wifi drops game crashes etc, and are suddenly hit with an hour long ban even though they never rage quit once.

There's nothing wrong with pitching a new idea. But you shouldn't be so agressive against others when they suggest to you reasons why your idea wouldn't work."

Currently NOK is at 5.38 Euro, which would be 6.39 USD. On US exchange, $NOK ADR is $5.36. This is within 1% of the exchange rate. 

If you overlay the NYSE and the HEL charts, around june 30th the NYSE ADR appears to be doing better. That is because from the period of June 26th to the 30th, the Euro weakened considerably vs the USD ~1.8%

In addition to currency exchange rates, the discrepancies in the highs and lows can be explained by the timing of news releases. Generally the Helsinki exchange and the NYSE track each other within a few percent, but Nokia releases many PR and their earnings reports after market close in Helsinki, which is premarket in the US.

There is also most likely a difference in perception of the company between European and American investors to take in to account.

Seoul responded to Trump's comments by saying that under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it. Do you have any evidence that that statement is false? You say the THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA. THAAD is no exception. 	"Did you even read what I wrote? Or are you just trying to strawman me? 

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it. 

&gt;THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

Example: if a car dealer sells a car he must include a warranty under law, so that sale is covered by law, but then if the dealer says no actually you have to pay an extra $x or i'm not delivering that car he can do that and is not violating any law."

I disagree. Knowing that the studios are driven to seek the highest return for their film means they'll constantly be searching for corners to cut. VFX has been one of those corners for a long time, and the fact that there hasn't been union representation has helped that. Establishing union agreements for the industry will change that.  
 
When that happens, they'll continue to try to make their product for the cheapest possible and sell it for as much as possible, as many times as possible. It just won't be on the backs of the VFX artists and studios any longer."	"I honestly don't think we have the same understanding of supply side economics. You essentially agree with me that the studios will seek to make their movies and games as cheaply as possible but you don't see that as a barrier to unionization or the studios seeking cheaper ""scab"" vendors as a potential result.

This seems like the most important point. Games just rarely go that late anymore (assuming average to high MMR games).

That said, it doesn't impact me too much, unlike the removal of FotM—with right masteries, you used to be able to get 40+ regen by stacking health regen tank items (FotM + SV + Guardian's Hammer), all for just 6k in gold, and can conditionally bypass Warmog's in favor of other items that are more useful in team fighting.

I am _really_ curious how the midseason update next week is going to affect the tank and bruiser builds, though, especially with the addition of those two superb tank items (Adaptive Helm for anti-skill and DoT spamming mages, and Gargoyle for multi-man resistance gains). For one, I expect the likes of Cass and Teemo to see some drop in win rate over the next few weeks."	"I think a big reason for me is on most AD tanks/bruisers i can usually utilize regen. If there's a few enemy AP's i can build visage and titan hydra. Lots of ap add banshee's. 

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of? 

Idk you could come up with something fun and balance-able."

For example, a couple where both spouses make 50k/year will pay less tax than a couple where one spouse makes 100k/year with the second spouse having no income. 
As I understand it, spousal RRSP's were designed to allow the higher income spouse to put RRSP's in the lower income spouse's name in order to lessen the income gap and thus reduce the couple's taxes in retirement.
Since then however, those with a qualifying pension can elect to split their pension (for income tax purposes) and thus reduce the couple's income tax. A more direct and sure way of evening out a couple's income.  
Thus, it appears to me that since the introduction of pension splitting, spousal RRSP's have lost most (all? I am not a tax expert) their relevance. "

If you have already leased the tower you have probably provided them an easement (and probably access to it) but that may be a question for an attorney who would need to review your contract with them. 

For example, this is not very clear:  *It is only accessible by bypassing my property's main/only entrance.* if your property is not the entrance then how is it accessed? May need to upload a drawing for us to view. Or aerial image from google or something.

So not really sure what else they want, now? 

It surely will impact your property value when you sell, how much is a very market specific question. You'd need to talk to knowledgeable local agents or hire an appraiser. You'll get a bunch of guesses here but that's all they will be. 
 "	Thanks for your input! We acquire the 40yrs lease when we purchased. Currently, they want to buy out our lease with a lump sum, but have perpetuum easement.

I should've said ""It *came* true. Now what?""

And I still want an answer to that. Your ""False prophecy from Satan"" came true, and built up the body. Now what? Do we add to the Bible? No. Because Scripture DOES in fact carry greater weight than some specific Word for a specific time and place. Scripture (aka your precious ""canon"") is for all times and all places. Not all of God's Revelation is. Otherwise we'd have a record of what those poor, ""falsely prophesying"" 70 elders said.

1520	dgz1e9f	dgz2a68	PoliticalDiscussion	[verwijderd]	"Grow up, dude. I answered your question respectfully.  If you disagreed you could've addressed me respectfully as well. However, I will be the bigger man here and respond to you like a human being.

(1) Many economists tie the 2008 recession directly to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.  The lack of separation between commercial and investment banks is likely tied heavily with the Recession. Things along these lines are difficult to prove though, as are many things economically.

(2) I, individually, don't have the right to limit power. But, as an American, I support and elect the people in the government. And the government does have the power to tax and limit power.  A tax on the richest of us (read: Wall Street) can be used beneficially to help the poorest of us. Robin Hood took from the rich to give to the poor. And the average person doesn't care about the globally economy of they're still dirt poor. And, because of income inequality, they're getting poorer, while the rich are getting richer. A Robin Hood tax could alleviate the wealth gap slightly.

(3) The fact that the media is owned by so few large corporations. The fact that in many areas you only have one choice for cable providers. I could go down the list. Monopolies exist. Many monopoly laws aren't being enforced. I don't need to create new monopoly laws.

(4) Yet, somehow, politicians still get paid tons of money from corporate donors. Look how many politicians on both sides of the isle are in bed with certain industries.

(5) Profits not being spent on improving the company should be taxed. They're doing no good and not helping the economy by sitting there. Do you really think that Exxon needs as big of a profit as it does?  Money should be put to use improving society, not locked away where no one can touch it.

(6) People do store their money in places like the Cayman Islands all the time. People, using creative tax ""loopholes,"" find ways to avoid paying taxes on their money by keeping it overseas. That needs to be stopped.

You don't have to agree with me. And, as I said, it's possible not all my ideas would work. I'm not an economist or an expert on the subject.

Now, rather than saying you disagree with my philosophy (it's clear that you have a more libertarian economic philosophy, which I don't agree with for a variety of reasons), why don't you say what you believe should be done to eliminate income inequality. Do you even think that's something that should be eliminated?"

1579	dku306j	dkznpni	OutOfTheLoop	"He is a relatively new rapper that comes out of South Florida. A couple things gained him attention:

Many of his songs feature aggressive lyrics and yelling. This is unusual in the mainstream hip hop genre and appeals to some of the more aggressive types.

He was punched on stage by a Rob Stone supporter (the guy who made Chill Bill) and consequently set off a rivalry.

His most popular song, ""Look at Me"", has an extremely. similar flow to an unreleased Drake song, nicknamed ""KMT"". If you want to look up a side by side comparison, they are in fact very similar. Xxxtentacion called out drake for this alleged copying. 

ASAP Rocky shouted out him on social media I believe, which gained him a huge chunk of attention.

During his time at prison, where he was charged with assaulting a pregnant woman, (a charge which he denies heavily and there is no concrete evidence for) he heavily increased his cult following and people were saying ""free X"", most notably Lil Uzi Vert.

I listen to him and went to his concert, his music is kinda fun if you're a fan of the loud angrier type stuff. However he does put out slower songs, more so before jail, and other songs like Riot which have a different style overall; if you're into that.

1598	czjcje0	czjgev5	Christianity	"> I'd say atheists could learn from Christianity how to be more humble and cautious about proclaiming the accuracy of the popular scientific models.

It's certainly true that some atheists need to follow this advice, having based their rejection of Christianity on scientific results. (I recall one time being broadly rebuked in an atheist forum when I suggested that the theory of evolution might eventually be replaced by a better theory.) 

Some other atheists, however, reject Christianity on its own (lack of) merits, science being irrelevant. I'm a former Christian in this category, who after a long struggle had to give up on Christianity because its internal workings simply did not make a bit of sense. I couldn't tell what I was supposed to believe.

"	Evolution wouldn't so much as be replaced as it would be refined.  You would have to ignore all the current evidence for it to replace it completely.  Instead, it seems more likely that that evidence could be interpreted in a slightly different way.  The observation already happened.  Though, the understanding could change.

Where things begin to get complex is that this conveyor (actually a scroll with conveyor underneathe), Will be stopping and starting quickly in a way that the robot cant control. The manufactures I've talked with (Fanuc and Denso) all have issues maintaining accuracy in the accel/decel phase. 

Also I'm in search of a good/simple VR physics sandbox for modeling alternative solutions to this problem, if there are any recommended programs for simple brainstorming/animation. "	"The robot arms are modeled in Blender and then the IK coding is done in Unity. Yes, velocity and acceleration are specified on a per-joint basis, along with the appropriate limits of rotation.

Vallejo is very forgiving in terms of brush strokes, but they're bad at sticking to the plastic (the primers are better, but still not great). Tamiya is harder to get an even finish with (retarder is supposed to help), but dries quickly and bonds well. With gunpla you're assembling painted pieces and posing, so being able to stand up to scuffs can make a difference. That said, the suggestion to use lacquer thinner is a good one if you don't mind the fumes. Vallejo does have a great color selection, plus lots of primers, varnishes, mediums, washes, etc. Whatever you choose I do recommend using a real thinner; water/alcohol aren't quite as nice.

I'd say get some cheap brushes that aren't bottom of the line, different sizes. Always use the largest brush you can for a piece, to minimize brush strokes. Invest in nice fine tip brushes for smaller details -- I like the gsi creos ones, you can get them thru Amazon. Strong, even bristles and predictable behavior will save you headaches when trying to paint the little stuff.

I use the alligator clips on sticks. I hold them by the clip while painting (sometimes challenging to find a place to clip it on) and put them back on the stick to cure.

Was lightning fast .Fuckin 7 year old was playing me.

Was told that the Humvee in front of us slammed on the breaks because they were throwing puppies in front of our Humvees to get us to slow down so they can steal sht. That was like 2min into my 1st tour.

No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful. I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit? Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it. 

So yes, you're a troll. "	"&gt; No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful.

My viewpoints aren't even remotely offensive. If you've got a very thin skin, then yeah maybe my comments are rude and unwanted, but they certainly are very helpful comments.

&gt; I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit?

The views that I have aren't horribly offensive at all. Regarding women, I never said that they were ""worthless piles of shit."" It's just that Western societies like ours are under siege by feminists who say they want ""equal"" rights for women when they actually want female domination. Women are mentally and physically different from men and thus should not have the same rights that men have.

&gt; Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it.

Despite the number of downvotes that I get from cowardly, close-minded people like yourself, there are still a lot of people who agree with the things that I say. I believe everything that I write, and I'm sure that there are people out there who appreciate what I have to say.

&gt; So yes, you're a troll.

If you do not move into that slowly and deliberately, the penance for the first week or so is more olfactory than dietary.

I mean swimming is probably the closest, because it can be dangerous, and you might find a pool at your friends house, but swimming has been taught in schools. However you don't go over to a friend's house and find a rock wall high enough to seriously injure you and a bicycle doesn't kill you if you sit on it wrong. 

I make the sex ed argument again. Would you say ""don't have sex"" is a good enough sex education? No because it's not. People are going to have sex. Guns are cool and when kids (and adults) see them they want to look at them and touch them, even if they know they shouldn't. Yes you teach not to play with the gun, but you should teach how to safely handle one in case they do anyway. "	"&gt;However you don't go over to a friend's house and find a rock wall high enough to serriously injure you and a bicycle doesn't kill you if you sit on it wrong.

You are far more likely in life to encounter steep drops then guns. 

And more likely to encounter a bike than a gun.

So your saying it makes more sense to just avoid those things if your not trained to use them correctly and safely?  You should avoid the edges of sharp drops, and not ride a bike in the street?  A rock wall isn't the only thing a kid might try to climb.  trees, buildings, bluff faces, fences...  shall I go on?

Kinda like you shouldn't handle a gun, and the solution is the same thing, but for one you want mandatory training?  So rather than waste money so morons can be justified not locking their guns up properly, how about we continue to teach kids not to touch them.  It works for most children, after all, its the exception, not the rule, to have a kid playing with a live gun."

Truth of the matter is that this woman had no idea whether this was the case or not, only presumed the cop guilty, and she herself drove distracted shooting video while admittedly speeding, endangering everyone around her that she so self-righteously claimed to be protecting from a speeding cop.  

Get off your high horse. Nobody anointed you into some police oversight position. Drive safely to the station (you passed right by it off I-95) and file a formal complaint with the desk sergeant if you're so concerned. "	Seriously, she even says in the video that she has the the police car's vehicle number. She doesn't even have to go out of her way and drive to the station, she can just call them at home and report a dangerous driver.

1765		dkzporv	ADHD		"I'm dual diagnosed.  Was on Vyvanse for 1.5 years, till I realized it was making me panicky and jittery...  (Think panic attack but the entire day...  But I just thought it was stress, since I only really take it during the academic year.)  It also was messing with my sleep, I think.  (I've never complained about it, thus never diagnosed, but anxiety is typically comorbid in ASD.  And Vyvanse is known to exacerbate anxiety in people who have anxiety issues.)

Since they are so often found together (ASD/ADHD + anxiety), I'd probably look more at how the meds affect people with anxiety (if this is also a problem for you), rather than how ADHD meds affect people with ASD.

No side-effects on Adderall (XR and IR), though it doesn't give me the energy that Vyvanse does.  I kind of wish I could combine them, but my psych said no.  :(  lol

Neither medication ever left me ""hyper,"" and both increased focus.  Though Adderall doesn't quite work as well as Vyvanse for me in that regard...  It's all about how each med affects you, specifically, because everyone's biology is different -- even if we have the same disorders. 

As an aside, even people who *don't* have ADHD or similar will still usually get increased focus from stimulants. "

I just don't want to watch the game slowly die again, be it from the game simply being out of touch with what the MMO crowd expects or because BPG runs it into the grounds.

Before you say anything I have the same predictions for DnD.  I think both are doomed projects, although each I have different thoughts on why / how.

1776	dgyvvij	dgyxcb3	ClashRoyale	Goblin gang, zap, log, skarmy, skelly (keep those tho), thombstone, cannon, ice golem, and ice spirit to name a few	"I agree with Log, Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, Skeletons, Cannon and Ice Spirit being very powerful for their costs. 

I personally think Ice Golem is good where it's at, as a cheap mini tank/distraction unit/skeleton killer who does very little damage and no longer has a ridiculously large frost nova.

Cannon itself isn't too strong in my opinion, it's just that it's too similar to Tesla and thus replaces it any time someone looks to add a non-Inferno tower defensive building. To me, the solution is to buff Tesla, maybe by allowing it to hit two targets like Ewiz (no stun effect) and slowing it's hit speed accordingly so that it's DPS doesn't get insanely good.

Tombstone I feel is fine, definitely an annoying card especially if you're using Hog Rider or Elite Barbarians, but it's low hitpoints make it reasonably strong against ground tanks and troops. Maybe a slightly slower stream of Skeletons would be good, but that might kill the card's usage entirely.

Zap is a weird one because for the longest time it provided too much value, but after the damage nerf I think it's found a good niche as a reset card and Skeleton Army killer. The problem with Zap of being an easily overleveled common won't disappear unless the developers address that problem, so unfortunately overleveled Zaps will continue to be a nuisance. But in challenges, Zap is pretty balanced because it doesn't kill too much and the duration of it's stun isn't too long. The most frustrating part about going against Zap is how quickly it's deployed when compared to Arrows, which did receive the deploy time buff recently but still feel considerably slower. So perhaps a slight nerf?

Let me know what your reasoning was with the cards you mentioned!"

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

But I am pretty sure it won't be less than $200 because it includes a whole other camera (which I hear they're also having issues with) and two controllers. I'd imagine it might even cost up to $300. Vive is seriously your best bet.	Don't get me wrong I want a Vive it just depends on how much it costs up front. I don't see the camera being that much on the touch, it's a camera ya know?

I'm reasonably familiar with seg funds in general.  Not so much in the specific anymore.  So take it for what this is worth, I did a 2 second drive by because my initial suspicion is that your statement is false.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.  

It's also not saying good or bad.  It's just saying, I don't think 5% guaranteed annual rate of return."
1836		dkzs1df	FORTnITE		I played on PC since the Alpha and it acts as my main account but I also have friends on xbox to play with so I purchased it again. Similar thing happened, I played for a few days and finally got an error message when logging in via Xbox and when I went back to PC it wouldn't let me in either. The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days. The whole making you go through the tutorial again I didn't have to deal with so that sounds scary.... I don't know if my fix will help with you... but if it does, yay?

1838		dkztdu2	Entrepreneur		"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."
1839	czj8we6	czjap00	AskReddit	Really, I'm American and ever since I learned about the GB pronunciation I thought it made more sense. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any other elements that end in -um that *don't* have an i there. Francium, Cesium, Iridium, Lithium, Magnesium, Uranium, Plutonium... so Aluminium fits right in.	"Platinum, Tantalum, Molybdenum, Lanthanum are the only other four elements that end in ""um"" but not ""ium"". Though Copernicium could have ended up being ""Copernicum"".

What's more interesting is the original, and now obsolete, name of Aluminium was ""Alumium""."

2) to cover, my process is first find midi versions of the song, and load them into a daw. Identify the imoortant/memorable parts of the song, and delete the rest. Make an arrangement that will work on the POs limited polyphony and number of patterns. Take advantage that you can repeat patterns if possible. Dont try to make a note for note cover.

In some cases, the U.S. has major corporations paying nothing at all with the current tax code.  That makes no sense whatsoever given that corporations use the nation's infrastructure more than citizens do.	"Those loopholes and exemption aren't cost free in an economic sense. Deductions and exemptions in the tax code influence behavior. The new behaviors aren't always the most rational.

In many cases, entrepreneurs will make bad long term decisions in order to chase a tax break. Lots of companies will relocate operations to sub-optimal places in order to attract a one off tax subsidy. Think of how much time NFL team owners spend trying to lobby for a subsidy. Right now, Apple is sitting on a huge pile of overseas cash and is simultaneously borrowing money in order to issue dividends because the foreign cash is taxable while the interest payments on the debt are tax deductible!

We want companies to think about how to maximize profits, not thinking about how to minimize their tax bills.

We know that inefficient tax gaming happens for individuals. Look at how many people buy a house ""for tax purposes"" or choose a poorly performing 401K plan because they get an upfront tax deduction. *Many* people put money into a flexible spending account only to lose those funds the next year because they didn't spend enough on health care in time."

1. Black cleaver is a great item for the cdr and utility and you should probably build it every game. In the early game, you sacrifice a little bit of dmg compared to ghostblade but you should still be able to win lane with bc. The health will keep you alive esp vs true dmg opponents and 20% cdr is a ton. Can also buy a tiamat in between there if you feel you need more dmg. BC also helps transfer riven into the mid game.

2. Spirit Visage is still a viable option as it is gold efficient and offers really good components. However Maw and Scim are most often times going to be the way you want to go. The AD and MR offered by Maw is huge not to mention Moar armor pen, and the passive will give you more sustain than SV however you have to reach low health for it. Scimitar is also useful with the QSS tons of AD and lifesteal.

3. Although it definitely makes sense, it was a little surprising that everyone had the same exact answer of early hexdrinker vs ap match ups. SO DO IT

4. Deadmans is good for vsing a team without a lot of crit, and the moves peed passive is good on riven and helps with flanking. Randuins is good for the crit Champs like Yasuo, trynda, and some ADC aoe slow is really nice too.

5. This guy is still not someone you really wanna fight. I'd definitely recommend reading all the posts for this one but basically you want to kill him pre 6. Nidalee posted the build of BC&gt;Lifeel steal item&gt; Lord Dominik's Regard (LW)&gt;life steal item with lucidity somewhere in there. Try to roam.

6. It's more of preference. I personally like mid because most of your apponents are squishy but will often have cc to lock you down. Again hexdrinker is good here and QSS for Champs like Annie or Tf. Jungle riven is doable and fast Qing the minions is how u do it. However you should look to get rolling early as you fall off if you dont.

1907	czj4l3j	czj4sy4	MapPorn	Are there any blacks-only, Coloured-only, or Asian-only towns in South Africa? I know the Bantustans were supposed to be monolingual black-only territories, but they were explicitly the product of apartheid.	There are many blacks-only and coloured-only towns but not on purpose. These towns simply haven't had any non-blacks or non-coloureds move into them. Orania and Kleinfontein are intentionally whites-only. If you're looking for examples: here's the town of [Bullettrap](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/364006) - a 100% coloured town in the Northern Cape and here's the town of [Allandale](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/276132) - 100% black. I have never found a 100% Asian town in South Africa, because, like Whites, they are never a majority in any municipality and therefore when apartheid ended a lot of non-Asians moved into their areas because they were of a better economic standing. Very few whites have, for example, moved into Soweto or Tembisa because they're usually from a better economic background and Soweto is generally poor

1915	czivtte	czj9aan	AskReddit	"my husband is 240 lb, and he's strong and very muscular underneath the fat because of his job, but he's still fat.  he's always been fat as long as i've known him.  he's got the beer gut, the man titties, the jelly rolls.

i'm 110 lb.

honestly, he's hot.  he doesn't have to be a skinny doe-eyed model to be hot.  his look and his style is... really good.  being fat is honestly part it.  that's ok.

i can speak for any skinny person porking with a fat person when i say, if you love the person, you're gonna love the body.  if you don't love the person, you're just there for the body, and if the body isn't your cup of tea, why the hell are you there in the first place.  my guess is that fat women will put every effort into their appearance and being sexually pleasing to try to ""make up"" for being fat.  but again, if you love the person, you're going to love the body.  they shouldn't have to make up for it at all in a loving relationship.

i can say for the record, my SO never ""retains"" body odor when he washes up, and doesn't have a bad odor to begin with.  different people have different hygiene habits, fat and skinny alike.  i can't speak for fat women, but fat men can be a great fuck.  they have a lot of thrusting power behind the d.  just had sex an hour ago and i'm a happy camper.  high five!"

On natural vs fused, naturals have generally higher stats than fused, hence why they are stronger. You'll see this once you get to compare your first natural and fused. You are guaranteed a natural 5 start in a month of playing.

1956	dgyh84g	dgyx9zn	BlueJackets	"When you need an anchor on your blue line to eat tough minutes against the opponents top skaters, Jack Johnson is... not it.

But playing middle tier minutes with a great skater like Savard alongside him, he's looked better. As has been said, he is almost certain to be our expansion draft loss, and that is just fine. He will do good there, could be their captain and possible face of their franchise at the start. Good for him.

As for us, we have Nutivaara and Carlsson who can play the minutes, and Ryan Murray is simply a lot better than Johnson with the puck. He makes better passes and reads the play better (although admittedly not as durable). Subtracting Johnson and adding Carlsson makes us better defensively. Plus if Johnson is picked, it means Anderson (who will likely replace Dubinsky in a few years) and Karlsson won't be. 

I'll thank Jack for his service. I won't pretend I always liked his game but I will sincerely appreciate the effort he gave this team and city. "	"I wholeheartedly disagree with so many things in this comment. First, if you offered Ryan Murray a million dollars to do this with a puck he couldn't: https://twitter.com/NHL/status/848695374076420096/video/1 . The only thing Murray is better at is stretch passing and stick checking. His positioning needs a ton of work. His speed is light years behind Johnson especially since the knee injury.

Second Nuti and Carlsson at this point in their careers could never skate the minutes and responsibilities JMFJ does. Do you wanna see Nuti on the PK? I don't. Maybe you didn't notice that sometimes Nuti played 10 minutes a game because he was flat out not being defensively responsible. I like the guy as a future play maker but come on. Carlsson is good and promising but far from a sure enough thing to bail on what was an elite shut down pairing this season. Defensemen aren't nearly as plug and play as offensive guys.

Third Josh Anderson is a winger, so he can't replace Dubinsky ever. I love Wild Bill but he, and even Andy are 10x more replaceable than Johnson. Perhaps you haven't heard about this Dubois guy we have, or Kolesar, Abramov, Milano, Stenlund, "

Star Citizen will take the best of all possible worlds, ranging from a permanent, persistent world similar to those found in MMOs to an offline, single player campaign like those found in the Wing Commander series. The game will include the option for private servers, like Freelancer, and will offer plenty of opportunities for players who are interested in modding the content. Unlike many games, none of these aspects is an afterthought: they all combine to form the core of the Star Citizen experience.

1978		dkzy9fs	AskThe_Donald		"Net neutrality basically means that the people who control the guts of the internet have to treat all data the same. It doesn't matter if the packet contains a few seconds of a Netflix movie, some text headed for Reddit, a gamer's data, Skype call, encrypted mystery numbers — it all goes in the same pipe as everything else; it all moves at the same pace.

The reason this is so important is that ""the people who control the guts of the internet"" are now a very small number of very large corporations who would really like to inflict *horrible* things on us, but are being prevented from doing it by these rules. ""Oh, you wanted to Skype your family? Let's just slow that data to a crawl so it basically looks like you're tunneling through 1995. But if you upgrade to our *premium* plan, which includes Turbo Skype, only from Verizon, you'll enjoy crystal clear quality for only $19.99 more a month!"" Basically, without net neutrality, your ISP would receive legal permission to digitally torture you for money.

The better solution would be to have robust competition, so if your ISP ever tried this, you could switch to one of the many others. Then we probably wouldn't need net neutrality rules. But right now, many people only have a couple ISPs they can use, so that's not much help.

Net neutrality is not a philosophically ""correct"" thing to do, because it represents a lot of intrusive regulation in the tech sector where that's not desirable, but in the situation where we find ourselves, it's better than the alternative, which is frankly horrifying."

You can't get rid of a CI!)

I don't agree with the thought of *fixing*. It's a way of improving your life. You may not think that and that's fine.

By giving the children a choice do you mean having a final say on it?

* Point two
Actually we get that alot ""oh you can't drive! You're deaf!"" ""Oh, sorry you can't be a server, you're deaf."" Etc. Usually (at least for me) causes a ""I'm-gonna-fucking-prove-you-wrong"" attitude.

You're talking as ""we"". If that happened to you, I'm sorry. Dumb people say dumb things.

If that causes you that attitude, GOOD. But don't do it because of them. Do it for you. Prove it to yourself because at the same time you're showing them that you are capable and this disability does not define you.

* Because of the school I went to and parents and employers etc. It was basically the only way my high school would let me finish my junior and senior years and my parents wouldn't let me go to a Deaf school or learn sign language. 

Can you explain this better, please?


*I chose not to wear them because they didn't help (I've tried them recently and they don't help at all anymore) as much as people thought and I got tired of sort of distinguishing noises, it made me concentrate too much and I'd always end my days with a massive headache. That and they aren't cute, but that's the last and least important of my reasons.

how did they not help? are they're the ones behind the ear or the smaller ones that goes inside?"	"I mean just let children be part of the discussion, it's irreversible and ultimately their body, their life. I sure as he'll also disagree with sheltering deaf kids in a Deaf bubble (but that may be my mainstream upbringing speaking) 

School I went to was a private school and they were very much anti-signing (so we're my parents) my parents refused to let me learn sign language because they said me being deaf was God's way of punishing me for being gay. And alot of employers are surprisingly not that educated on Deaf people, which is reasonable if they don't see Deaf people all that often.

Yeah hearing aids basically helped me sort of hear sounds but for them to be even remotely intelligible I had to basically put all my concentration and effort into it and so it was more a hinderence then a gift."

2035		czj4sf6	Truecels		"Humans as well as other animals have more 'biologically programmed' mating strategies, but basically they divide into two categories
1) have as many children as much as you can and with as many man as possible so that your children will be as diverse as possible. 

This is the main mating strategy for women in underdeveloped societies: south america, africa, etc.

2)pair-bonding strategy. Have one make that will take care of you and your offspring and offer him sexual exclusivity so that he will be sure the children are all his and will take care of all of them and stay with you. This makes the man to feel so-called 'love' for the woman. Marriage was invented for this specific strategy. It was invented to encourage people to use this mating strategy so that man will not focus on competing for women but focus on science, writing and advancing of society. That is why societies that were more traditional managed to become much much more technological advanced than the ones that had the 'fight each other to pump and dump women'.


If a woman already had sex with many men, she knows subconsciously that the pair-bonding strategy is less and less likely to work for her as man are programmed to bond with females who are only theirs because they do not want to end in a situation to provide for a child that is not his.
In this case the instincts of the woman 'switch' to the first strategy- be pumped and dumped by the most strong, the most seductive men and have as many children as possible to make sure at least some of them survive. She needs to have more children because without a man to provide for her a lower percentage of children will have chances at survival. Thus she becomes what we call today a 'slut'.

This two types of strategies were vastly studied and appear in animals and also in humans.


In a civilized society a 'paid-bonding strategy' is the norm and allows the society to advance. 
A society that has 'pump-and-dump' as a strategy will become more and more a shit-hole. This is the reason that black communities in US live in such poverty and violence. This is their strategy. Be aggressive, fight other men, prove to women you are violent enough to survive to have a chance to pump her.

The whites had a very different strategy and created a very different societies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory

Read about a very interesting species where males with different mating strategies have different colour (a proof that the mating strategy also has genetical factor)

And to be honest, it's not like Grim Dawn has a narrative worth stopping for either. 	I actually really like dialogue in RPGs as long as its not a huge presentation like in a theatre play.

If you want a moment that I can remember, I have vague memories of a lot of Georgia moments. I kind of remember hearing about Georgia winning the SEC in 2005, I remember that Georgia played Hawaii in the 2007-08 Sugar Bowl and that I thought it was funny because Hawaii is the next state after Georgia alphabetically, and I remember seeing the end of the 2010 Georgia-Florida OT game and being disappointed that Florida won. I remember a little of the 2012 SEC Championship game and Georgia being ranked #3, but I didn't fully grasp how close we came to greatness until recently.

But you probably don't care about all that. The first really memorable thing in my CFB-watching experience was watching Georgia hang half a hundred on Spurrier's Gamecocks in a small Mexican restaurant. It was glorious."

Being prepared to actually call it as he sees it and not buying into the rule of players toeing the line with the politically correct answer doesn't create an obligation to come up with a solution. 

Same way that you could ask players what they think would happen if some indigenous draftee does a war dance in their first game and dedicates it to his inspiration Goodes post game, 95% of players would tell you that there is nothing controversial about that yet you can be sure this would attract plenty of controversy regardless of whether or not it should. 

Edit: I'll go a step further and suggest the 95% are the problem. You can't fix a problem if your not prepared to admit it exist. It is the ones who openly say there is an issue who open the door to discussing how to fix it... and the persin with the solution is not necessarily the person calling out the problem. "	"See I understand your point, I just really doubt the motivation. This is not some murky little understood phenomenon. You don't need to be playing at a footy club to realise homophobia still exists. 

Literally nobody is pretending homophobia is extinct. They may insinuate we should be better than that, but that is not the same thing. The fact footy is traditionally a boys' club and not easily overturned, is something well understood, hence the league's focus on women's involvement, broader community involvement, and the general talk of homosexuality etc.

So if everyone understands the problem, and he isn't offering a solution, then that raises the obvious question; why speak on this in the first place? Well we all know he loves the sound of his own voice, so that's a good starting point in answering that question."

If people want more lanes open, they need to buy more to justify it. As it stands, ""the system"" generates schedules that are tinkered with as little as possible (usually to meet availability demands or to be below scheduled hours limitations set above store level); these schedules are meant to reflect customer flow as best as possible.

And ideally, if you see more than two people in line, they're supposed to be getting salesfloor people to the front to help, though that doesn't always work promptly.

This was followed by thirty five daily radiation treatments with seven simultaneous weekly chemotherapy treatments that ended just before Christmas.

Cancer was stage four. Five year survival is around 60%. It

After a couple of PET scans,  no sign of it returning.

Went from 240 to 170 pounds.

Still have trouble eating.

Gotta be honest here- it sucks!

Worst was right after treatments finished.  I just got sicker and sicker.

Did not need to get a feeding tube.

Islam gave women the right to choose their spouse without force, unrestricted education, allowed women to actively fight in wars, allowed women to become scholars (in fact, the oldest University that's still running was founded by a Muslim woman, 12 centuries ago. Furthermore, Muslim women were given the right to work, and wives were also given the right to work and gain income (in fact, the husband is forbidden to touch his wife's hard-earned money), Muslim women were allowed to not take their husband's family name upon marriage, plus the husband's parents isn't the wife's responsibility to take care of. And trust me, I'm only getting started. Say what you like about the corrupt Muslim leaders and scholars who bastardize Islam's teachings, then I'll agree with you.

Women being treated as second-class citizens is mostly down to the fall of the Ottoman empire (at least between Persia and the Levant), which made the breeding ground of corrupt scholars and leaders destroying what's left of those area's moral integrity. Saudi Arabia is down to the appointment of a corrupt tribe with the help of the British.

If you have actually cared to read the links I posted, then you know that Islam (in it's untainted form) is totally against rape of all kinds. Why did you ignore it? Y u do dis, man?"	you probably know more about it than me since you are muslim, so i'll just believe you. sorry dude, just obviously, this shit makes people angry and feel irrational hatred.

Most of the time, the landlord can re-rent the place before then, at which point you owe them everything from when your lease began until they get it re-rented."	"How would they collect it, by trying to sue me? Does that happen often or is it not really practical?

Basically I have no issue helping the landlord find someone to replace me, I've done that before. I don't think it's fair to be on the hook for $12,000 (assuming $1,000/month which is cheap) for a place you haven't spent a night in.

The other thing is that I'd probably be renting in an apartment building, so the landlord might be some random company rather than a real person who is willing to work with me. In that case is it common for them to sue people to try to collect money? Do they have any authority to use collections agencies?"

2195		dkzreo0	Advice		An excuse is standing somewhere between you and the next step you need to take. – If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way.  If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.  This may be tough to accept, but it’s the truth.  Stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  The only person who can truly hold you back is you.  So no more excuses – it’s time to change.  It’s time to choose what’s best for YOU.  Oftentimes when we feel stuck, we are waiting for something magical to happen.  We wonder when the winds will change in our favor.  We do this instead of embracing the present and admitting the change we need to make.  What is keeping you from stepping forward?  If not fear of failure, then what?  Insecurity?  Laziness?  What is your excuse?  We all have one.  And when we focus on our excuses more than our steps forward, we walk in a circle and fall into the familiar pit we call “Stuck.”

&gt;Why are you so insecure about your dick? I'm seriously asking

Dude responds:

&gt;wat, no I'm not... I am about everything else though... the dick is the only good thing on me, that's not the point... He implied that I said ""blacks don't have bigger dicks/ women usually don't even like big dicks"" because I have a small dick and I was saying that because I'm butthurt . By posting my 8 + inch penis I provided proof that I'm not saying that because I'm butthurt about my small penis because I clearly don't have one and that the reason I said that is because I have seen how women feel about my penis. I provided proof for my personal experience to back up my claim. It's not about a fucking dick."

2204	dgwdvsa	dgywo82	EARONS	Why do we assume that he was the one who made the map? Notebooks often get used by several people. Perhaps his mom or dad or older sibling had used this particular notebook before. Or perhaps those pages were dropped by someone totally unrelated to the crimes. 	the homework handwriting matches the writing on the back of the map. 
2205	dkzddx2	dkzq3od	TibiaMMO	What place is Shargon's hideout? never heard of it	I don't even know if that's really the name of it. It's the two floors under oramond furies, which is the last part of the dark trails quest. Since it's a mix of furies, dark torturers, undead dragons and some other stuff, it can be pretty reasonable experience as well as profit.
2206	dkyxrxk	dkzrpz5	Shadowverse	...why did you liquify Grimnir? He's still an amazing card. It was more of a love tap than a nerf.	I disagree. The only deck I can see wanting Grimnir now is Dragon, because it can comfortably ramp to 10 and use it as an effective boardwipe. Not having the reach to close out the game was much harder than just a lovetap and I wouldn't be surprised to see it dropped from the crafts that have better 3 drops.

I'm usually not very good at all at predicting that stuff, but it was no surprise at all.  I think it's because he kept going on about how he has a very good memory and how he was able to pull up a wealth of information at a moment, like Sherlock.

My annoyance was much less slight though when I worked at a restaurant where the chef/owner pronounced it like that. I mean she had a very grating personality in general, so that definitely added to it. Still though, this is a recipe she wrote, and when the chipotle powder she uses for it runs out, she's the one who orders more, and when customers complain about it, she's the one they talk to, meaning that she has to have heard the correct pronunciation hundreds of times throughout the time she's had it on the menu but she just doesn't care.

&gt; A team of researchers from Italy&amp;#039;s University of Trieste and the Cambridge Graphene Center recently made significant headway in this direction when it successfully demonstrated that untreated graphene can be used to interface with neurons without damaging their integrity.

This YouTuber is extremely talented with makeup, came close to winning the NYX face awards last year.

* which state they live in

* which way someone votes

It's okay to only want responses from a particular group of people (Americans, Males / Females, 18+); you just need to make sure that you are requesting those things in the demographic section of your survey title.

He's fantastic at fusing humor intelligently into a great story, and Antman is a great example of him injecting heart into the story. 	I feel like wright would be great for a spin off. Not sure of his long form story telling skills, but he certainly could be a good choice!

The other thing that didn't make sense is why use backup members if there are only 4 venues. There are enough elite ten members even if you include ishiki and erina out. "	I don't think it requires them to be in groups, I think that it's just that they all wanted to go

We shall not speak of finding clothes that fit that shape.	Yeah, finding a shirt that fits giant boobs and then a tiny everything else made me look like I was wearing a tent.

2259	dgybuvx	dgyviir	Mcat	"To offer a different perspective, i strongly disagree with this poster. I've routinely seen individuals with no major scientific background, including humanities and engineering students score extremely high. Engineering students would have some familiarity with MCAT physics and chemistry, but that's it. As a matter of fact, a significant % of the highest scorers in our schools MCAT club is encompassed by the aforementioned cohort.

At the end of the day, how you score relies almost exclusively on your critical thinking capabilities and mental processing speed."	It's great to have differing view points on this and I feel a little more confident after reading your comment. Do you think the Kaplan review books would suffice to cover basic content knowledge?

2271	dgyp4ym	dgyws4m	BattleRite	There is still sustain in his M2, just on the round 3 battlerites instead. Wasn't it always from a battlerite? Because I'm missing something if it used to be baseline.	"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."
2272		czj9shy	WeAreTheMusicMakers		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "

There is definitely nothing wrong with feeling that way. You are genetically attracted to people with different features.

There is literally nothing I--or any other woman--could do according to your belief that would convince you that they are anything other than brainwashed and that makes your stance inarguable and, ultimately, screwed up because it just puts you in a place where you are telling women what to like or think--the same as how things are now. You're not progressive; you're just patronizing and controlling. "	"You're free to sexually fetishize yourself being murdered, if that's what you're worried about. But it doesn't make it healthy or right. 

I'm sorry you're angry, but what does it matter what I, a woman who has seen many more years, think about you? For the record you seem like an incredibly bright person who has great potential to do some real good in this world. So then, what is missing? Why do you feel the need to come in this space seeking validation for lifestyles and ideals that we've already personally experienced and/or extensively studied before you were even born?

2311	dkz7dr3	dkznfly	Bowling	"> I don't necessarily need to stick with Storm/RG, just how things worked out. I used to throw a ton of Hammer and EBI.

Fair enough!

> I find myself throwing the Daredevil and Hyroad the most, and I love both of those pieces.

Cool. Both of those look great (I own a HyRoad, and have considered adding a DD to my setup also), so no objection there. Opens the path to dropping the !QTF also.

> So just for confusion sake. I'm likely going to pull the !QTF out of my bags and buy a DDTrick or GB2.

thumbsup.jpg

> I don't have much info on either, so is there one you would recommend over the other?

Given that you have a mostly Storm/RG bag (and more importantly a Dare Devil already), I'd lean towards the DDTrick (bigger cover, same core) for that reason. GB2 should be similar just a board or two less overall hook vs the DDTrick.

> And if I decide I want to bowl more tournaments I should pick up a monster hook ball.

Agreed.

> Can you also recommend an Asym monster to pick up?

The Mako and Sure Lock are pretty much leading the field right now for the asym hook monster slot. The new No Rules Exist from RG could also be good, but haven't seen enough from that ball to have as strong of an opinion on it. I personally have a Sure Lock for that slot and love it."	Just to butt in, Sure Lock then ball down to DDT seems like a great combo, granted I've had the DDT for just a week.
2312	dkz2oay	dkzubj6	TheMassive	"Ok, so I keep seeing this sentiment (in this thread and others) that being annoyed with our current standing and our performance this year is silly and foolish.

Can someone tell me how fighting for a playoff spot over midway through the season in Berhalters highest PPG year ever is a good thing? No?

So can we stop acting like thats a good thing? The sky's not falling. Its also not raining Supporter's Shields and MLS Cups, and its ok to want that. Stop insulting and putting down fans who are frustrated with mediocrity when this season is exactly that. People see teams like Chicago and TFC who have been historically terrible at the top of the table, and they want the Crew to be there. But fuck them right?

I don't want to hear about point totals unless you can look me in the eye and tell me that 6th in the east (out of 11 teams, so right in the middle) is a *good* team and we should be happy to be in this position. Wanting an above average team instead of average ISN'T A BAD THING, so stop treating fans who want and expect that like they're bad fans."	This. 👏

If it reduces traffic and emissions, or even just one, this will be worthwhile. "	"Electric cars and spaceships and an engineering problem. Elon is an engineer. He is perfect to solve those problems.

Transportation planning is a well, planning problem. Its a different field. He has no idea what is going on in that world. Speeding up a tunnel digging machine? Fantastic, that's an engineering issue and I hope he makes improvements. But turning that, into what is shown in the video does not follow. 

This is also true of the Hyperloop. Can he be the person to turn his sketch into technology? Absolutely. Will that invention solve a transportation problem? Not likely in the real world due to many constraints he has no understanding of. "

2326	cziwpyq	czj8x8a	AskReddit	True, this will be one of the last jobs taken by automation, mainly because of how delicate some of the work is, and the lack of maneuverability in modern robotics.  	"Not delicate, really. My job is a lot of banging on shit until it comes loose, it's the troubleshooting that would be the hard part. Someone has to program the automated process. That someone can't think of every possible situation. Most ""troubleshooting charts"" that you'll find on places like AllData or whatever eventually boil down to ""uhhh try to send it back to the manufacturer"". Troubleshooting oftentimes requires a kind of finesse that you can't really teach. Sometimes that ""finesse"" is just wanging it with a hammer, but it's also knowing when that's appropriate."

I have Mediacom. 100 mb down 20 mb up. 

There are only two (actually 3 isp's) here in the Desert. Two that matter (Mediacom and Verizon) the third is a local isp, but speeds are not their strong suit. 

I have the fastest consumer grade connection available. For 70 bucks, it's not bad. 

My ping issues are from having 3 roku's  in the house, which are always on, plus phones, laptops, tablets, etc... 

My pc is hard lined, everything else is wifi. Which, I turn off when my roommate is out. So the roku's, and everything aren't interfering whilst I play. 

But, Mediacom will not dual connect us, and Verizon does not connect on my side of town. So, I pay for everyone else to use my friggin Internet. Which sucks. 

But hey, that's all about to change. I am getting my own place this month (Feb)."

Honestly though it's not unusual when you have a home grown company to clear out the old guard leaders at some point after it goes public.

2385		dgyv4as	worldwonders		"In March 1958, a B-47 bomber took off from Hunter Air Force Base near Savannah, Georgia destined for the UK to take part in a training exercise. While in flight a warning light indicated that the bomb, called an Mk 6, wasn’t secured properly so a crewmen went to check on it. While he was inspecting he accidentally grabbed the release hatch lever instead of a hand-grip to pull himself up. This sent the 8,500-lb. device crashing into the bomb bay doors, forcing them open and plummeting the bomb 15,000 feet below. Fortunately, the nuclear head for the bomb was in a separate location and the bomb was not armed. The bomb detonated on impact, leaving a 75-foot across, 35-foot-deep crater. It destroyed the home and property of the Gregg family of Mars Bluff, South Carolina. The family of six was injured but there was no reported fatalities.

But for most healthy people, it's just allergy-like symptoms.

The fact is that it's unnecessary and expensive to have the mold tested, even for ""black mold"" (*Stachybotrys chartarum*, or *Stachybotrys atra*). All mold infestations should be treated the same, and that's just to remove it yourself. If this is the only spot with mold that you know of, it's likely you can just clean this up and have no problem at all. If it is occurring in multiple places, maybe hire someone to inspect the house for it.

The CDC has a nice guide on how to deal with mold in your home - [you can find it here](https://www.cdc.gov/mold/stachy.htm). I recommend you take a look at that and try removing/treating it yourself before spending unnecessary money getting it tested."	"Thanks for this reply.

Mk2s would probably be about a grand at the same mileage, maybe just under 2000 for one with REALLY good bodywork. If its your first car, and again, im probably biased, i would consider getting a Mk1, as they're slightly lighter, and the 1.8. its about 115 bhp so not so powerful as to send your insurance skyward, but fast enough you can push her, if youre inclined as such. The only issue with that is, you have to very lucky with the body condition on that one.

Unfortunately Reddit only cares about the echochamber that says Bernie could actually win a general election. Believe me, I would love it if he was the nominee, nothing would make me happier than to put our candidate up against a Socialist for a slam dunk. Kinda like how reddit thinks Rand Paul has a shot at the Republican Nod...

2521		dgz1plj	LetsTalkMusic		Good question. It depends on the song, and how I'm feeling at the same time. For example, whenever I listen to a song by Unwound or Drive Like Jehu, I like to focus on the guitars, and how they sound. Whenever I put on a song by Cocteau Twins or Slowdive, I absorb the instrumentation as a whole. I like to let myself fall into the feeling that a song gives me sometimes, instead of focusing on specific instruments.

The things I have learned from our head maintenance guy about pools you would never want to go swimming again at least in public pools. He had to get certified and had to take classes on how to care for our two pools and he was telling me that the chlorine smell that you smell in pools is not how a pool is supposed to smell. When you smell the chlorine that is how the chemical reacts to people peeing in the pool. So I asked my brother in law who builds pools for a living if it was true and he said yes it's true.

0 wins... discounting your 1 free win.

That deck isn't that clunky, I'd argue. Math is hard and I'm a bit drunk so here's the simplified, perhaps mangled version. You've got 9 cards that are playable by turn 1 and 2 (no stampede, explosive trap, etc, just minions). Drawing 1 of them makes you happy as a hunter. By turn 1 you've got a 43% chance to draw at least 1 of those 9 cards. Excluding 2 drops, you've got a 37% chance to draw a playable 1 drop by turn 1.

Statistically you should've landed a curve pretty often. All you had to do with this deck was stall until you meme them out of the game. What went so wrong?"

2547		dgyy87e	OverwatchUniversity		"You're trying to get back into the game casually right? So treat the game like that. All your post tells me is that your emotions are tied to whether you win or lose. You're saying things a casual player wouldn't. Who cares if the other team has a 3-4 group. Who cares if no one talks? 

Remember that even two perfectly equal teams will have one team lose, and one team win. Sometimes there's a crushing defeat. The other team probably isn't talking either. 

And if you're done using the word casual so haphazardly, group up. Find other people to play with. Some might not be great, but stay with the ones that have synergy with you. /r/OverwatchLFT/"

It's kind of unfortunate that my girlfriend, who is not from NC natively, has told me, ""Sir/ma'am"" is unnecessary and awkward, thus wouldn't want to raise potential children saying it. After some convincing she realized it's a respect thing. But how could anyone find fault in that?

I love your overall gist of ""the majority is not always correct."" It's completely true. I also must realize that where I am for work is in a liberal area of the state. It doesn't necessarily reflect everyone, everywhere, in the state itself.

2585		czjed08	Naruto		"Best Ninjutsu: Kaguya, I mean shes the goddess of chakra

Best Taijutsu: Guys 8 gates

Best Genjutsu: Itachis Tsukuyomi

Best Summoner: Jiraiya with his toads

Best Summon: When Sasuke summons that snake to save himself from Deidara, I don't remember the whole explanation but it saved his life so I'd say its a pretty important one.

Best Hokage/Kage: Hashirama by power but I really liked Minato, I thought his kunai teleportation stuff was really cool.

Best Teammate: Neji :(

Best Character Growth: This could go to so many people but I'm gonna avoid just giving it to the MC and say Gaara.

Best Shinobi: Kakashi, always willing to sacrifice for his village and friends, never afraid to fight to protect what he loves. Very wise and was given the task of trying to guide Sasuke and Naruto which was difficult given ones clan was slaughtered and the other was the nine tails jinchuuriki.

Best Kunoichi: Tsunade, very tough woman and the only female Hokage, one of the three legendary Sannin.

Best jutsu: Madaras Tengai Shinsei based on power, but I did really like Sasuke's rinnegan power in the Boruto movie(Amenotejikara )where he's able to teleport from one space to another in an instant.

Best Arc: Chunin Exams were alotta fun first time around. Either that or the Pain arc.

Best Villian: Tobi, very mysterious and powerful.  I remember being on the edge of my seat during his fight with Minato.  ""I could say I did it on a whim, or that I planned it, or that its war...or that its for peace"" - one of my favorite lines in the series.

Best Fight: This is so hard to choose.  My personal favorite was Kakashi vs Obito in the Kamui dimension.  Animation and emoitions were so high during the fight.  Itachi vs Sasuke is a close second, very tactical fight and a lot of fun to see unfold.

2586	dkzgcgc	dkzozv9	AskReddit	">Nah, fuck it. When I'm a dad, I'm breaking the cycle and letting the colorful language fly.

This is what we've done with our son, He understands that we don't mind if he says any of the words except ""Fuck"" (my wife just wasn't having it) - so he can say ""Bitch, Asshole, Dickhead, Twat"" etc. and we don't care, he understands that this is a unique thing in our family, and that other families consider this kind of language to be a non-starter (especially when we live in Utah, surrounded by mormons). 

So far, we've only had trouble with the school once, when he told some kid who was bullying him to Fuck off, and the school sent home a letter with him explaining the situation which we were supposed to sign and return (To confirm we'd acknowledged the issue). I flipped the damn thing over, and wrote ""My son wouldn't have to use such strong language if that other kid wasn't such a cunt.""

His school doesn't contact me anymore, they go to my wife if they need something.


Edit: To clarify, he did get in trouble for using the ""Fuck"" word, but I wasn't too angry because he was standing up to a bully."	"Weird that your wife stops at fuck, sounds like you're British, guess the culture's different?

As an Aussie, fuck can be one of the least offensive swear words and one of the most versatile. I use it casually all the time, though probably too much."

2608	dgy4lgf	dgyzwvt	AskReddit	"Zig-zag trenches being dug toward the perimeter of Khe Sanh.

I had heard about them, but then I'd heard about a lot of strange things in my first couple of months in-country in Vietnam, 1968. Didn't really register.

One of the weird things about Vietnam was that there was no front line. The enemy, the Viet Cong guerrillas (VC) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) were the topic of conversation, but you never saw them - no dead soldiers, no POWs, no flag on a distant hill that marked their positions. 

That war was the first full-scale war that involved the hide-and-seek kind of warfare we're more used to now. Now the idea of two armies banging it out across a ""front"" seems as strange as the peekaboo! kind of war did to the Korean and WWII cadre that led us in Vietnam.

It stayed weird, even after I got outside the wire a couple of times. I was mostly firing at bushes and trees. We all were. Sometimes the bushes and trees fired back, and sometimes when we went to investigate there'd be someone dead or hurt behind the bushes.

I was wondering if Americans, South Vietnamese soldiers (ARVNs), the VC and the NVA were ALL fighting some kind of plants, triffid warfare. I thought maybe the bushes were shooting both ways, and laughing at us all.

Seemed that way. The enemy was abstract, almost surreal to us. No one knew exactly where he was. 

I was designated as an artillery air observer - I sat in the backseat of a piper-cub-like airplane, or the right seat of an observation helicopter and adjusted artillery from the air on the top of suspected targets that I couldn't see because of all that damned vegetation. Occasionally we got shot at. The rounds came up at us out of more bushes. Never saw any humans.

The Demilitarized Zone north of Hue was lined with Marine ""dye marker"" forts, the biggest of which was jammed 50 miles west of the sea at the juncture of North and South Vietnam with Laos. It was called Khe Sanh, and it was a *huge* Marine base.

Khe Sanh was the low-hanging fruit the US military had deliberately set up to attract major formations of NVA. 

The Viet Minh, the original opponents of the French in Vietnam, had reclaimed half their country from the French at another such base, *Điện Biên Phủ*, in 1954. They had laid siege to the isolated base, dug zigzag trenches toward the perimeter, to allow their infantry to approach the wire safely for a final assault.

I had read about those zigzag trenches. The general leading the NVA assault on Khe Sanh was the same general who won that old battle. I reckon the US command just decided to package up a firebase out in the boonies to look just like *Điện Biên Phủ*, let Giap imagine a replay of his glory days.

Well, he fell for it hook line and sinker, so much so that the Americans were kind of surprised, a little worried. I finally got assigned a flight out to Khe Sanh.

My God. There was this huge base, bunkered in and defended like nothing else I saw in Vietnam. We couldn't have taken that base, if the Marines didn't want to let us in. 

And around it was what used to be jungle but now was a moonscape of bomb and artillery craters. And through the moonscape, I could see them - zigzag trenches heading for the wire. They never made it - always ended in twenty or thirty huge bomb craters.

But that was my first *real* evidence that yes, there were actual human beings out there trying to kill us. And getting killed, too. Lots of them. Someone, many someones dug those trenches - bushes didn't do that. And you could see where they died, blown to smithereens.

I guess that was the idea. It certainly worked. Giap spent a generation of NVA soldiers trying to take that camp. It made ALL the papers in the US. Some mighty scary headlines, but really the issue was never in doubt. All they managed to do was get a couple of battalions up to the wire, where they were mowed down and blown up. They needed divisions of men hitting that wire, and that was *never* gonna happen.

This is a long story about how I finally awoke to the idea that yes, I was actually fighting someone, someone human that is. I mean, I *knew* that before I came in country, but y'know I don't think I believed it.

But those trenches... were monuments to the valor of the men opposing us. Gotta give them that. That was suicidal, crazy.

Besides, their sacrifice was not in vain. Win the battle, lose the war. The Khe Sanh siege, especially the resemblance to *Điện Biên Phủ*, was a major factor in the creation and motivation of the anti-war movement stateside, which eventually took America out of the war. I guess I wasn't the only one who was impressed by those trenches."	"Your story reminds me of a book a read not too long ago called ""West Dickens Avenue"" it is about a Marine who spent 77 days at Khe Sanh.  The author was a part of a mortar team, and he might have been in contact with you.

I also find it interesting how the man who wrote ""West Dickens Avenue"" and yourself have taken vastly different views of the war in general.  John Corbett wrote as if going out to Vietnam, seeing combat, going on patrols, and seeing the things he did was all just par for the course.  Even after seeing the enemy, he always seemed rather detached from it all.

All in all, it was an interesting read, and I recommend anyone who is curious about Khe Sanh to pick it up. "

To elaborate: Sher Khan is losing pilots and cargo in the Bermuda Trapezoid. He tricks Baloo into flying for him by giving him a trophy and declaring him the greatest pilot in the city. There's a comedic portion where Baloo argues with Bossy Cat Lady (whatever her name is) claiming that he won't lose the plane since he's the greatest pilot in the city. The planes and ships were going missing due to Don Karnage putting a giant mirror that tricks pilots into thinking that they're upside down and cause them to crash. Kit and Baloo crash the Sea Duck, fight the pirates, and save the day. Baloo realizes he's been tricked and barges into Khans headquarters, demanding a trophy for Kit as a token of appreciation.

Thatd why people are giving him a hard time, he's one of the higher paid guys for his experience level yet shows no heart."	I mostly agree, but I don't think this exactly shows no heart. I think it shows that he's 19, and under trained.  I don't mean he's lacking skills, I think he's lacking training experience.  PVZ trains with TAM, I bet she gets her ass whooped all the time.  I bet she's been in every imaginable bad position you could be in as a fighter training with those guys, but with Sage...I highly doubt he spends a lot of time getting whooped on his back, or with a big guy on top of him trying to put him to sleep (regardless of how bad it was). This isn't Sage's fault, it's his Dad and trainers.  If they let the kid stay at Tristar longer than a couple of weeks or w/e he did then he'll improve leaps and bounds, he'll be put on his ass by people who truly know what they are doing and gain the confidence needed to work out of bad spots.

2668	czjeqmt	czjeye0	DestinyTheGame	I feel like like I very often outgun rushing shotgunners with my doctrine of passing. I also feel like I have an edge against midrange snipers as well. Although the doctrine is considered an upper echelon primary. I think the main issue is that there isn't much variety in what primaries are effective not that there are no effective primaries. 	"Here's the thing: even if Doctrine, MIDA, and TLW are sort-of-kind-of-okay right now, that still leaves us with:

A) only three competitive options, when the lack of diversity was one of the biggest issues/complaints of year 1 (Thorn/TLW/Hawkmoon/Messenger)

and

B) three options that are *way worse* than the best three options in Y1. 

Doctrine of Passing is nowhere near as good as a Year 1 Thorn. A guy with a Y2 TLW would lose to a guy with a Y1 TLW 100 out of 100 times. It's not even close.

On the other hand, snipers, heavy, and supers (for the most part) haven't changed since year 1, and shotguns are still dominant despite nerfs, so where we've ended up is still only having three competitive primary weapons, except now they're much weaker than before, but everything else maintained it's power. That's pretty broken, IMO."

"I think right now it's to easy to slap made in the US on the package and call it a deal with no accountability. They can't falsely advertise but they can manufacture a product in a low wage country, finish it in the US and then declare it made in the US. 

Making the address of the factory readily available on the package would let us as the consumers know who is honest and who is not. Once you know the address it would only take a few minutes to figure out how much manufacturing is actually done there and the big one, weather or not they are abusing a visa program.

2680		czjd235	PoliticalDiscussion		"I will attempt to respond to your generalizations with some of my own.

Senator Sanders is promoting many ideas that are seen as hallmarks of the ""college liberal"". Things like universal healthcare, free or reduced tuition, socialism as a viable economic model, etc. The ""college liberal"" does not often find a candidate who shares these ideas with them.

Adults (I'll assume over 40 here) likely have carryovers from the Cold War and what socialism was seen as then. My parents for example, equate socialism with the USSR. While this isn't technically correct, they were both born in the 60s and were brought up being told that the USSR, and therefore communism/socialism, was their enemy. 

They have also seen firsthand the fall of communism/socialism in Eastern Europe and view an attempted return to that as horrible.

Now, again, these are very broad generalizations and I'm basing my thesis for the perceived adult dislike of Sanders on a single issue: socialism.

Many adults like Bernie. Many young people don't like Bernie and his policies. I am one of them. 

Neither young people or adults are monolithic entities. Both can have all sorts of different viewpoints.

Edit: also, some adults may have seen candidates like Bernie come up in the past promoted ideas like his that they approve of, only to watch them fail. They may be disillusioned. "

Set up with an MSR (no supressor) up the road and wait for a clean shot. Shoot the resource truck twice and the whole convoy stops. If you're super pro, you can pop the driver and the truck will stop with a ton of health left. It helps to be about 300m away before engaging to not get immediately steamrolled by the escorts. Then drone over to the stopped convoy, mark everyone, then put the suppressor back on and pick off the remnants. When they're all gone, saunter up and tag the truck.

2709	dgy2l8u	dgyu8ei	AskAnAmerican	Go into more detail, please. I know it's anecdotal, but I don't run across people with anecdotal experience of two systems very often.	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."

2717		dgytefr	Vive		"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."

2750		czjghzc	AskMen		"Why study accounting if you are interested in technical stuff? Why not try engineering? Or Construction Management?

Anyways, I was going to school for economics and pre-law, and once I graduated I took up electrical work with my father and opted out of law school. Best thing that's ever happened to me, but it's hard work, sometimes working with scum people, but the pay is great, and the fact you can work with tools and big equipment all day is awesome. The only things I don't enjoy is being on-call, my hands hurting after work, and the fact that I never know what time I'm going to get home. We work in a very specialized field, so don't take my experience as the majority.

As an electrician, or any trade for that matter, you will never starve; as in no matter where you go, if you do good work there is always a larger demand for work than the supply of skilled electricians/plumbers/roofers etc. 

Don't let the white-collar people fool you...my dad paid for my sister and I's college by running an electrical contracting company. We make better money than a good amount of the office jockeys, but they will always say the contrary.


I would suggest going to school for Construction Management also, while working with a general contracting company doing every trade you can get your hands on. Or specialize in one thing like electric/hvac/plumbing and get out of school and get real work experience.

Good luck, and I'll reply back if you have any questions."

2761	czj4ua1	czj6rdx	MakingaMurderer	[verwijderd]	"Watching MaM, I was very open to the possibility that he had a plausible explanation for the phone call that was not shown. I was well aware that I was not seeing his entire testimony. However, reading his full testimony, I was struck by the fact that he never actually gives an explanation: 

&gt;Q. Investigator Wiegert, did he give you the license plate number for Teresa Halbach when he called you?

&gt;A. I don't remember the entire content of our conversation but, obviously, he must have because I was asking the dispatcher to run the plate for me.

&gt;Q. Did you not trust that Investigator Wiegert got the number right?

&gt;A. I don't -- That's just the way I would have done it. I don't -- It's not a trust or distrust issue.

This is not actually an explanation. If he says at some point that he was verifying information about the case, I haven't been able to locate that statement. Later on redirect, Kratz assigns Colborn this explanation, which Colborn accepts:

&gt;Q. Mr. Strang asked whether or not it was common for you to check up on other agencies, or perhaps I'm -- I'm misphrasing that, but when you are assisting another agency, do you commonly verify information that's provided by another agency?

&gt;A. All the time. I'm just trying to get -- you know, a lot of times when you are driving a car, you can't stop and take notes, so I'm trying to get things in my head. And by calling the dispatch center and running that plate again, it got it in my head who that vehicle belonged to and what type of vehicle that plate is associated with.

He's not talking specifically about this case, he's giving a general explanation of scenarios in which he might call to verify a plate number. In the Halbach case, he'd clearly gotten enough information that he immediately went to follow up on a lead by interviewing Avery. I'm stumped as to how or why he'd have written down Teresa's license plate number separately from the other info about the case he'd have needed to question Steven Avery."

2793		dkzq3cm	ShouldIbuythisgame		"**Earthlock: Festival of Magic** is a chill RPG that's pretty breezy.

**Siralim &amp; Siralim 2** are monster capture games that you can pretty much play indefinitely. They're relaxing games that be focused on or played while winding down for the evening/netflix. The games aren't linked, so you can play either. Siralim 2 has a much more focused narrative and progression system. Siralim 1 is basically ""here are the mechanics, do whatever.""

**Stardew Valley** has been mentioned before, but this game is love. If you haven't played it you should at least check it out. It's similar to Harvest Moon/Rune Factory, though very much a western game.

**Bastion** was great fun and pretty chill. It's kinda action-y, but I didn't struggle with it despite having shitty reflexes. It also has a very soothing narration and ambiance.

**Shadowrun Returns (Original, Dragonfall, Hong Kong)** isn't a difficult game, and it's got an amazing cyberpunk atmosphere. The games are turn based and not particularly hard if you play them on the lower difficulties. The lose condition (you died) just means that you have to restart a mission, and none of your companions die permanently. 

**FEZ** is a charming platformer/puzzler that just oozes style. It's great fun and I definitely recommend it (though it's creator is a real dickhead).

**Decromancer** is a card battle game with an interesting world and a fun premise. The gameplay is really enjoyable if you're into card battles (more like strategic combat, really). No lose condition- failing a battle just means retreating and healing up.

**The Sims 3** is my favorite of the franchise, and you can pick up the expansions really cheap as they go on sale frequently. If you've never played it, I recommend it. You just sort  of dick around with your family of sims and play through a life simulator. None of the expansions are necessary, though I find Ambitions adds the most without changing the way the game plays.

**Mages of Mystralia** is an action-y little RPG where you play a fledgling mage learning her spells. There's a very fun spellcrafting system and the game hasn't been difficult. No scares, and deaths aren't terrible."
2794		czjecvf	FinalFantasy		"Mighty Guard is a must.

If you want to farm early ability points before you get to the final dungeon, Level 5 Death will also be very nice.

White Wind is useful.

But definitely make Mighty Guard a priority, it's easily one of the best spells in the game.

---

When I meant farming, here is a video of the spot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-l0R16u-YU

This is when you get to Castle Bal, a little after you get the Ranger class.  Most people like to max out Rangers because they provide the ability to attack 4 times (8 if dual wielding which I believe was a Ninja ability).  So freelancer with Dual Wield == massive damage (also pretty cheap, avoid this method.  It completely removes the fun out of some fights.)

Late game prior to Neo Exdeath in the final dungeon, you'll fight Movers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdX9xv8V6CA

The title says rare mob, but quicksaving causes them to be the second mob spawn.  This is your late game Abp farm, but it has nothing to do with Blue Magic.

TL;DR:

Mighty Guard

White Wind

Level 5 Death (if you want to max some jobs out early.)"

2800	dgyxich	dgyynkv	MortalKombat	"I went off on a tangent there eh? That was a long ass post I wrote. But yeah I was just explaining my thought process on the whole situation of Mileena's character in this timeline VS the original one.

I might have divulged in fanfiction territory with me talking about how Mileena would ditch Outworld for Earthrealm (had a story in mind when I wrote that) but it was an idea I had should she make the transition to good. The idea being that Mileena wants nothing to do with Outworld (or being Empress) and wants to start a new life in Earthrealm. Of course that would involve Mileena's character undergoing a significant transition and would have to be explained by Raiden telling Mileena what Shao Kahn really saw her as. Fanfiction territory, I know lol. Still would love for that to happen though.

But yeah I agree with you on the Kitana/Mileena feud needing a revamp in this timeline. If the previous timeline had Mileena jealous of Kitana being treated better than her by Shao Kahn and her status of Princess of Edenia and all that stuff, I think it should be flipped around with Kitana being jealous of Mileena's newfound humanity (should she ever become good) now that she's damned in the Netherealm and Mileena is living a new, peaceful life in Earthrealm. There can also be an element to the feud where Kitana see's Mileena as a lesser version of herself that doesn't deserve to live. She would also hate that Raiden took pity on her resurrecting her when she tried to have her killed before so in a sense that would sort of mirror their previous feud where Mileena was jealous of Kahn's preferred treatment of Kitana. Basically it's the perfect role reversal that adds a completely new layer to MK's greatest rivalry.

And there I go again on another tangent lol."	"Haha no worries, man. It's all good. I could shoot the shit about Mileena and MK all day.

Yeah, maybe that idea is a little fanfiction-esque, but it would certainly be a story with a unique twist on Mileena's character. 

I do think the idea of ""flipping"" the Mileena/Kitana rivalry is an interesting concept, i.e., Kitana being envious of Mileena while Mileena is enjoying success either in Earthrealm, or ruling Outworld, or whatever; while Kitana is stuck as a revenant in Netherrealm. A role reversal indeed."

The savings of workers becomes invested. Share value comes from profits, which you can call surplus value if you want to, nonetheless, workers do not earn more money when they enter into arrangements where there is no surplus value being generated, so it is immaterial to them. It is the best arrangement for them, quite obviously, if all other attempted arrangements have not produced as much wealth for them.

And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

> workers do not get their wages from stock prices, they get them from a portion of the value they create for the company. 

You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

> your making it sound as though the workers don't make money for the company, but the capitalists somehow do, even though the capitalists get this money by stealing it from workers like a parasite.

Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

What good is your concept of exploitation if you cannot create a business structure or the like that actually pays workers more. It's worthless, and employees know this.

"	"&gt;It is the best arrangement for them, quite obviously, if all other attempted arrangements have not produced as much wealth for them.

yet this has not been the case. when catalonia was managed by the anarcho-syndicalist CNT, workers got much better conditions from being able to actually decide them. please stop spouting ahistorical garbage.

&gt;And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

materials mined and collected BY WORKERS, machines built, shipped and used BY WORKERS, in factories and establishments built BY WORKERS. the only relation the capitalist has in this relation is control of capital, they contribute nothing to the actual production of material goods or buildings, and make money by leeching off of their work like parasites.
&gt;You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

this is in itself irrelevant to my response, and also bullshit. this money goes into wallstreet and doesn't come out. besides, anything invested in wall street came out of the labour of workers, and belongs to the workers, not the capitalists, who contributed nothing. they have no reason to be alienated from their own profits

&gt;Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

contracts mean nothing if the alternative is starvation, and alternatives don't matter if they are all equally shit. coops may not pay higher-up employees as much, but i can tell you that someone working in a coop earns much more than someone working in a sweatshop. coops also ensure better job security for the workers, as they are far less likely to fail. where did you get 14% from, breitbart?"

2825	dkxvqsg	dkzseuo	SubredditDrama	"I think lots of people hold libertarian views, but few identify with the libertarian movement. Those that do are generally the most passionate (and often most delusional). This is reinforced by the fact that the only path to political success is to join or support one of the two major parties, so you have to be really really dedicated to libertarianism to stick with it.

That's how you get people like internet libertarians who don't think GPS was invented by anyone and a candidate stripping on stage at their convention.

I think if we had an actual libertarian party that was on par with the democrats and republicans the majority would be moderate libertarians who don't think taxation is theft or that everyone has the right to own their own ICBMs."	"By many accounts, you're correct

see here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/

Kind of like how advertising works, those multiple McDonald ads are not to make you say hey I want to buy McDicks, no it is to effect your subconscious and make it the first thing your head thinks off when it is looking of food. You don't need a good ad to increase customers you just need an ad."	You make me so mad... I can't even fathom how dumb you are with this comment.

http://www.techtimes.com/articles/112605/20151203/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-sales-tank-but-dev-team-is-very-happy.htm ROTTR's figures for example are nothing spectacular, not even extraordinary, and compared to TR's 8.5 mil sales, these figures are nothing but dismal really.

Most people who use cracks use them primarily because they simply have no means of  affording them due to their national socioeconomic situation, but we've given back in the form of recommendations, videos, reviews, word of mouth to friends, providing, admittedly, a minute but constant and diversified local exposure for the product and those who are able to afford it are perhaps persuaded sometimes to acquire it. 

I'm not trying to say piracy actually helps companies sell their games but, analyzing figures and statistics, it doesn't hurt them nearly as bad as they claim and, in many ways, provide, if nothing else, at least a discernible and reliable form of local advertising. 

We are just the easiest target to blame horrible sales figures on. "

This a guide to comprehensive women's reproductive health that includes accurate abortion facts alongside milligrams needed for a DIY pill abortion if your state doesn't have great access. Also it explains risks/benefits of all abortion procedures. I have taken the Mifepristone and Misoprostol mix at planned parenthood more than once and it has always worked well although you basically miscarry at home which is uncomfortable. I've also had a D & C and am not sterile by any means.

If she needs any first person accounts of either procedure, do not hesitate to contact me."	Also the price of abortion goes up the longer she waits. With my medication abortion pills it was $600 all inclusive with pre op and post op care including ultrasounds. I actually need to correct my previous post. My actual medical procedure at PP was vacuum aspiration, not a D &amp; C. The procedure itself took less than 5 minutes in stirrups similar to a Pap smear. All together that procedure took about 5 hours with consent, pre op, Valium distribution, procedure, then 1 hour post op monitoring. Medication abortion took about 3. You take one pill in office then 2 at home the next day and you bleed heavily for a couple of days, including expelling the fetus. The surgical method was easier and bled less, but more invasive and gave me more anxiety than just medications and experiencing a very heavy period for a couple of days followed by bleeding for about another week or so.

2850	dkza5lh	dkzrwot	DBS_CardGame	"I actually picked this card today because of how much I *don't* like it. So to clarify, this card can't be played after combos are anything like that, it's pretty much a 0 cost 6k combo for red cards.

My gripes with this card is that it's really not that much better than any other combo card. Offensively, it's for most parts the same as any 0 cost 5k combo. 

Let's say you attack a 10k with another 10k and you play this bumping up your card to 16k. If they commit 5k, you win, but you would've already won the tie if you had just put down a 5k. To beat you they need to put down a 10k, which is the immediate next level, which also has the same result as a 5k combo.

The only utility this card has outside of instances of battle cards not having powers divisible by 5k is defensively. And that's pretty weird for a red card too. Only defensively does this card act like a 0 cost 10k. I mean, that's kind of neat, but I'd think any 0 cost 5k Battle card would be useful more often.

2875		dkzs3uf	ElysiumProject		I have asked this twice in the last week and seen 2 others ask in that time, they don't appear to give a shit.
2876		czjgh1z	ShinyPokemon		I think... it might be because you had such high expectations for this method. 800 eggs are a lot compared to some successful hunts on here but it's not even that bad. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if I go over 1k without a shiny. So... you should just keep hatching, your silver Eevee will come out eventually.

Eyeshadow. Yes it looks pretty, yes it would be a nice color for me, but now often will I use it?

Lip balm. It's always the same thing; I lose it, buy another one, and then I find the one that I lost. I do the same thing with USB cables.

Chica & Chico Beta-Salic. Didn't do anything for me. I purchased it as part of a set so it isn't a total loss though. The Astazet is wonderful.

Pore strips. Just no. Whyyy did I ever think they were a good idea.

Any sort of peel off or modeling mask. I just can't stand how they feel on my face."	"&gt; Lip balm. It's always the same thing; I lose it, buy another one, and then I find the one that I lost. I do the same thing with USB cables.

For both lip balms and usb cables, I used to  have the same issue. Now I keep one in my work bag, one in my purse, one on my night stand, one on my desk. And I leave them there. Since I've stopped moving them around, I no longer lose them and I always have one when I need it."

2880	czjfm3o	czjg8so	TrueReddit	The recent brinkmanship and lack of compromise do not necessarily come from a two-party system, however. They are due to the separation of power, specifically between the executive and the legislative branch in the United States. If we have a two party system, but the party in power can have total control over policy making, then there is no brinkmanship and obstructionism.	Remember those two years from 2009-2011 when there was a democrat in the white house, democrats in congress, and democrats in the senate, and the affordable care act barely passed even with many concessions to the republicans?

Someone earlier on was saying that the egg shape made for good aerodynamics though. I'm asking why it's the only hypercar that uses that design if that's true.

[Tam's Starship Sheet](http://starwars-unknownalliances.wdfiles.com/local--files/files/Starship%20Character%20Sheet.pdf) (Pdf warning)"	Thankyou for this link, it has some which helps.
2894	czj1e6v	czj4za3	BabyBumps	I had two miscarriages before my son was born a few weeks ago and I really struggled with anxiety at the beginning of the second and third pregnancies. People mean well by encouraging you to think positively and to avoid worrying, but it's also okay if you can't. Our thoughts alone don't make things happen -- and they certainly don't end pregnancies. Pregnancies often end because something has gone wrong early in the deeply complex process of building a new person. Miscarriage is a tremendously sad experience, but it's not the result of worry or anxiety or stress. Those things aren't _good_ for you, but lots of healthy babies are born to lots of anxious moms (myself included). Releasing yourself from that pressure to not worry might actually make you worry less...at least that was my experience. Wishing you the best! 	"Thank you. This and a previous comment saying something similar has helped. I can just hope for the best and try again if it doesn't work. I read a quote a couple of days ago, ""Not being happy or excited now isn't going to save you from what might happen."" "

2898	dgvsxof	dgyujz2	MkeBucks	I defended him all year but the last few weeks has been tough. He needs to play with Giannis and not in place of Giannis like he did the majority of the season. Kidd played them together late in the season but it still didn't work out (I think his shot was busted by then). Defenses still respect him though and having him on the court actually helped spacing because he was never afraid to shoot. I think some team desperate for spacing might convince themselves that they can help him get back to his just-sub .40 shooting. 	Yep to all of that.
2899	czjcdia	czjcj11	AMA	What got you in the situation you're in now?	Laziness and being a wuss for not switching colleges.
2900	dkzqp12	dkzqun5	FireEmblemHeroes	You could always give him TA/raven tome. The extra defense combined with the damage reduction from TA and Raven means that he can sort of tank colorless and green. Either that or keep his default tome (which is great for supporting), give him a rally and maybe a different C skill (Hone, Fortify, Drive Attack, etc.) and he turns into a decent team buffer/support. 	Maybe I will look into it when my other units have their builds finished. With the switched rates I'll maybe finally pull a Roy.
2901	czif5oi	czjei0t	DestinyTheGame	[verwijderd]	"I'm not really worried about my k\d. It won't change anything in game. It's just a shitty game mode for something like IB where you need to play a lot to get great drops.

I completely agree with you though, it needs to be clash so its not so fireteam oriented."
2902		dkzor0j	KSU		As accurately as I can remember, we usually get our refunds around the beginning to middle of September. Not everyone gets theirs at the same time, but you should get it before the end of September at the latest. If you have questions or concerns I suggest you contact the bursary office since hey handle most of the financial aspects of the school. 
2903	dgyywzz	dgz26ew	Rainbow6	"The basic design of Siege, where most engagements are within 10 meters, makes Glaz less viable. That being said, he wasn't completely worthless. He was still decent on some maps, such as Plane and Favela. We did see him occasionally used in pro league for certain strats, though he was pretty much a ranked only operator.

That's fine. The concept of Glaz inherently doesn't mesh well with Siege. Just make him fun for ranked, and he was good (which they did in 5.2). Instead, they tried to make him viable in pro league, and just made him this destructive monster.

"	I personally think that Glaz i balanced now. It's not like you see him in every single game, or at least not on ps4. If i'm in objective room and know they have a Glaz and start smoking the room I move to flank him even if i'm not a roamer.
2904		dkzo0iu	AskReddit		Hello-Adele. Because I can belt it out.
2905	czjbwi7	czjccst	MakingaMurderer	"Right. Bobby says he woke up around 2:30 pm, goes to the window, sees Teresa...goes hunting...comes home around 5:00 pm (around the time Scott arrived at Barb's). 




* Trial: Bobby doesn't see anything burning in the barrel at 5 pm when he got home from hunting.
* Trial: Scot doesn't see anything at 5:15 pm when he picks up Barb.
* Trial: Fabian says around 5:20 pm fire/smoke in the barrel
* Trial: Blaine says when got off the school bus at 3:45ish: "" I seen Steven Avery bringing a plastic bag to the burning barrel.""
* Trial: Gets home at 11 pm (the interview with police he was hone 9:30 pm-10 pm and saw nothing) says: ""I seen Steven Avery sitting there watching the fire.""
* Trial: Blaine is not asked if he saw a fire at 5:25-5:30 pm when he left to go trick or treating.


Summary from the trial - first police interviews do not match up:


* 3:45 pm: Blaine only person to see burn barrel/fire/smoke/Steven putting plastic bag in barrel.

* 5:00 pm-5:30 pm: only Fabian claims to have seen a fire in the barrel and that it smelled like plastic.

* 7:15 pm: Only Scott claims to have seen a fire in the pit.

* 11:00 pm: Only Blaine claims to have seen a fire in the pit.

* 3:45 pm: Blaine, Brendan, possibly Bobby were home.
* 5:15 pm: Blaine, Brendan, Barb, Bobby were home (none saw a fire or burning barrel).
* 5:20 pm: fabian and Earl were at Steve's (outside)
* 7:15  pm  Barb, Brendan, Bobby were home.
* 9:00  pm: Brendan and Bobby were home, possibly Barb.
* 10:00 pm: Brendan was home, possibly Blaine, possibly Barb.
* 11:00 pm: Brendan and Bobby were home.

If I've missed something or got a time wrong, please add.
"	Excellent summary. Thank you so much. Should I copy/paste it to the original post?
2906	czil9yb	czj8bfs	AskReddit	"I work in a comic shop and had a customer that got the name of a book wrong all the time.  The book was called ""Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose"".  TAROT, like tarot cards (TAIR-OH).  Every month he'd ask for his issue of TOKE-RAH.  I'd pronounce it the proper way, every time.... and everytime he came back he'd ask for TOKE-RAH.  

How the hell do you get a hard K sound from a word with no K (or C) in it?"	"But in the English language it is pronounced ""Tar-oh"".  
Don't get me wrong I know that many people do say it like you, but it isn't meant to be, think it's more about accents maybe?  

Source: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tarot?s=t"
2907	czit0o3	czj4gvb	AskMenOver30	"> The problem is not that you're ""not hot enough"".

The thing is, I've observed that my hotter female friends don't seem to have this sort of problem nearly as often. Guys generally are pretty straightforward in pursuing them if they think they have a chance."	"I really don't want to sound like some red pill creep, but there *is* a lot of game-playing that happens when we meet potential future romantic partners. *Maybe* your friends are hotter (but, for real, probably not), but it's likely they're just better at sending all those signals that tell a person, ""yeah, I might wanna fuck.""

It's true that some of those signals involve appearance--think clothes and makeup--so there's a relationship between successful signal-sending and attractiveness, but not really *innate* attractiveness. I have enough friends of both genders to know that beauty isn't the same thing as flirting skills, and the latter is what gets people dates. 

I'm not trying to start a fight here; I'm rooting for you! As some stranger on the internet, I know I can't change the way that you feel about your appearance. Maybe I *can* help convince you that a different approach could be more successful. 

Go get 'em! "

2909	czj8z2e	czjc1bk	LabVIEW	I think we're going to have to do overlay in real-time. We're going to need GPS data and other real time data, it might be too cumbersome to do in post processing. We'll probably just have to build a PC to spec.	"Might be worth trying to write it into a file with an index of the frame number - that way you're not doing image manipulation - just storing it - but still get all of the data. 

You could also do it in real-time on your PC - but you'll just need more resources to do so (RAM especially). 

Anywho - good luck with your venture - it is doable! "

Edited to add some information. 

I did not contract any diseases. The strip club was called Sundowners and was on Lundy's Lane in Niagara falls Ontario. Nothing was discussed beforehand. I got on stage to tip her, which you're allowed to do and had a dollar in between my tits. She grabbed the dollar and lifted my shirt. They always went by body language to see what was ok. She went up my skirt, pulled my thong to the side and licked for a minute tops. The crowd cheered and people were throwing cash at her, I didn't take any of it because it wasn't mine. After I got off the stage I was handed drinks, drink chips and cash throughout the night. 

I may have been a bit drunk by the end of the night. If you ever get the chance to visit one of these clubs, they are awesome.

Hope I answered everyone's questions. "	I've been there and it is not the cleanest place in the world

I play weekly at a college pub and one night I went straight into club hiphop and trap at 9 PM opening because the floor was packed to the brim with everyone sloshed. Other nights when the floor is a bit empty I work up the room with some Old School hiphop and jams to work the floor up.

2954	dkzk5py	dkzxayc	AskReddit	TOOL, it will always be tool it will never not be tool. They have fans that are equal parts pretension and teen angst. Virgin rage bombs. The way they worship the band makes me uncomfortable. Every time I criticize tool the only response I get is that one guy has a big drum set and that the songs are complicated to play. This does not make the music good or the fans less annoying. The best thing about metal is that part of it does not not take itself too seriously, it balances itself in a way. Tool takes itself way to seriously it is just a horribly mundane band with a cult like following. 	I love Tool but their fanbase is pretty terrible. They haven't released anything in over 10 years and from what i've heard, their live shows really aren't what they used to be. If you don't like them, whatever but the music itself was great when they were in their prime and still holds up today

2957	dgz1e6e	dgz1mix	Blink182	"I was just referring to like the band's current ""home base"", but how would an album titled California represent a departure from their Californian roots? lol

Essentially up until the hiatus/before the reunion, blink's roots and background were always based out of San Diego. Always. But once Mark moved to L.A. it became a grey area, especially since Travis moved to L.A. not long after joining. But now enter Skiba (from Chicago) and exit Tom (the only member left who permanently resides in San Diego), that part of the band's history is definitely gone atm, regardless of the song.

For example, during the hiatus when social media was much less extensive, their MySpace page listed San Diego (I think it may have actually even said Poway) as their hometown, but now when you look at their Twitter it says Southern California, which is pretty much playing it safe. Makes reasonable sense. Either way, California is their identity as a whole."	"Look at the themes of the songs. Even though they're light and poppy, there are a bunch with a dark undertone. Even the final song, ""California"", to me is a salute to the not-so-perfect California: perfect weather, yet stay inside; empty as a movie set; etc.

Southern Cali has been part of the band since untitled. Easy Target even mentions Southern California and running from it in a round-about way."

This means that the game will show a player facing one direction (let's say North) when the player is really facing west. When this happens, some players will try to line up headshots (the game shows they aren't looking at them) and end up dying, because in reality, they're looking right at them.

What happened in this video, is Thermite was facing one way, and on his opponents screen, it showed thermite facing another direction. Because it showed him face another way, his weapon clipped through the wall, and his opponent was able to kill him through the wall. "

If I'm using dedicated winter/snow tires (non-studded) and I slam on the brakes on packed snow or ice and lock up all four wheels, I still stop WAY more quickly than doing the same thing with all-seasons. The traction difference between snow tires and my all-seasons is so much that snow tires actually make driving in the snow less fun (and much less dangerous) for me because they just grip, and even when breaking them loose, they don't slide nearly as easily.

Fun fact is that when Merrett debuted, he played forward for about a season, then Lethal moved him back to defence, and suddenly he was performing a lot better. It's only really after Lynch and later Bradshaw moved on or when there were injuries to fill that he started playing forward again, and IMNSHO, he's definitely weaker as a forward than a tall defender.

Also note if the player retires in the same league as you or on your team. That regen will show in either rest of the world or be a free agent.

I personally set the sensitivity of the motion control a little bit up (more sensitive), so that I don't have to move my wrists too far.

I'm imitating what I would do while sitting at my work desk, but it seems I also naturally move my elbows up and down too, so that might help you."	"nope. I've been known to my doctor that I'm medically boring for being so healthy. Yea. I could look into more videos that actually show how people are moving their wrists. 

But I also don't have a clear understanding of when the system decides the ""neutral"" start position. Like on the PS4, if you accidently have the stick pushed up on start up, the game believes that is the neutral start, so the rest of the game you're fighting against moving forward until you reset. I figure its the same here, where the start up of the motion control resets or is set at some point of the game that I'm in a less than optimal ""neutral"" position that i have to reaaally fight for control. 

I could also try upping the sensitivity and as others suggested, continue using the stick until i neeed fine tuned aiming. Which I guess isn't too much of a deal since I am playing ink heavy weapons like brushes, rollers, and MG."

I would use the Kappa crossovers since they are built for the frequency response of the speaker set. the factory curve might not line up well with the speakers. 

I would not waste money on replacing all those speakers if you are going to install a separate amp. music is recorded in 2 channel so the biggest bang will come from getting and installing a good set of component speakers in the front with that amplifier. You will not have the ability to adjust or tweak the center channel with a good DSP. and the rears are just playing what the fronts are doing which will muddy up the staging and imaging."

3024		czjdrfg	RWBY		"Frankly I'm disappointed with the cliche dragon. I'm hoping it's just a rather old Grimm like a Goliath and not some super important higher class Grimm or some sort of Grimm Lord. Dragons are so overdone, they're like the equivalent of a spider enemy in a video game. 

I'm hoping that the Grimm more closely related to the source of Grimm, and whatever Cinder is using, are more like an eldritch abomination than just some copy&amp;paste lizard. "

3029	czj6dde	czj9j1g	AskReddit	"I am really excited to answer this!!!

1. Hillary has been an advocate for women and children her entire life. After graduating at the top of her class, she went to work for the [Children's Defense Fund](http://www.childrensdefense.org/newsroom/cdf-in-the-news/press-releases/2013/honoring-hillary-clinton.html).
She also found a home-based education system in Israel, and made it happen in Arkansas. 26 states now use this program. [More] (http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/24/hillary-clinton-cites-israel-as-inspiration-for-home-based-education-programs/#)
She has very similar views as Bernie when it comes to Women's healthcare and occupational rights. But wouldn't you want someone making decisions about Women's health coming from an actual woman? [More about Hillary on Women's rights](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/womens-rights-and-opportunity/). 

2. I don't have a source to back this up, so I am open to rebuttal, but having a president as far left as Bernie will result in inevitable gridlock in congress. A Republican congressperson may be more open to one of Hillary's proposals rather than Bernie's. His supporters are driven by the thought of a political revolution, but you cannot revolutionize the political system through executive action. Hillary has a background of working with members of the opposite party to accomplish her goals. [Like the time when she was First-Lady, and she worked with Republican members of congress to create the Children's Health Insurance program, which is still in place today i think?](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/)

3. She was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign. A lot of people got really mad about that, but as a gay man, I see that as a big deal.

4. She is the only candidate that has really addressed the epidemic in our country that is Alzheimer's Disease. She has released a [plan](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/alzheimers-disease/) on her website about taking steps to finding a cure. *This reminds me of Obama's SOTU 2016 when he suggested that 2016 could be the year we curse cancer, and put Joe Biden in charge*

5. She is very similar to Obama. Those on the Republican side believe that a vote for Clinton is a vote for another 4 years of Obama. I believe that sounds great? Obama has his flaws but he is awesome? 

6. Yeah she fucked up with the emails. I can admit that. She fucked up pretty bad. But there is no way anything like that will happen again, *amirite?* she's probably learned her lesson.

7. I am actually an intern on her campaign, so i have had first-hand experience talking to her supporters. The people that I talk to are genuinely nice people. They acknowledge her faults, but chose to support her based on her best qualities like the ones I have listed above. They don't bash Bernie, but honestly believe that Hillary's policies are more realistic. When I look at Bernie's fan base, they tend to focus on Hillary's faults and embrace his strengths. But it has gotten out of hand. Young people are saying that Hillary could be worse than any republican (she's not.) Don't even get me started on the Sanders' circle jerk that is /r/politics. 


I am going to wrap this up now, because I am getting really tired of typing. But if you took anything out of this huge amount of text it would be this:

TL;DR Bernie is great and it's awesome that you support him, but my vision for America is different than yours, so I support Hillary. Can we please stop being dicks to her?"	Haha it's hilarious, and actually pretty sad, that you already assumed that I am a Bernie supporter. I hate that /r/politics is a total Bernie ass kissing festival, I really want to hear other's opinions so I can actually think about why I justify my own and possibly so I can change my views and be better informed. And I totally agree with you and I am well aware that political revolution cannot come from executive action and sadly it seems that most Americans (especially select republicans who blame everything on Obama while we have a Republican dominated congress) believe that the president is basically a king. But I do have to disagree with you about Bernie supporters trashing Hillary and focusing totally on Bernie's strengths. Although it may be true with some (college age liberal redditors [my closed minded peers whom I attempt to distance myself from]) most people in my friend group and family who are Bernie supporters do not believe that Hillary is as bad as any republican. I promise you I prefer her above any of them as much as I believe her mistakes are rather serious. Some of the anger at Hillary that Bernie supporters may possess could  be evident because the Sanders campaign itself is not directly attacking Hillary, resulting in the Sanders supporters simply wanting their opinion of Hillary to be heard.  Anyway thank you for your response, hopefully some day that reddit can become less of a Sanders echo chamber and that people can have reasonable discussions.

But they've managed to lose it because of this identity politics crap.

Someone noted in a video that Bill Nye latching himself onto this identity politics crap is going to undermine all his efforts regarding climate.

3061	dgy8p7n	dgytt7t	DebateAChristian	">So are you denying that a chemical imbalance is associated with schizophrenia, or that it can be cured through operations that fix that u

What a weird reaction. I guess I didn't explain myself well. I am denying any connection between religious belief and schizophrenia or chemical imbalances. Brain defects always lead to dysfunctional life skills and religion (even wrong religions) generally does not. 

>You still haven't told me though, how do you respond to other people, who have also experienced extraordinary events, whose experiences may contradict yours or someone else's similar experience (as an example, Muhammad claimed to have been visited by an angel, leading him to found Islam).  

I'm not worried or argumentative about it. I know life is hard and though some people pretend that finding out the truth is a simple matter I let people work it out on their own. Atheism more than most ideologies depends on disproving others and while defending the our position is a part of Christianity it is much more the case with atheism. "	"&gt;What a weird reaction. I guess I didn't explain myself well. I am denying any connection between religious belief and schizophrenia or chemical imbalances. Brain defects always lead to dysfunctional life skills and religion (even wrong religions) generally does not.

Oh, I think we were both reading past each other then.  

I meant to try and demonstrate why the senses and emotions of one person aren't as credible a source as testable hypothesis, and tangible information etc.  

Specifically, I was trying to back up my claim that not all forms of evidence are equal.  Maybe I'm not arguing correctly against your original statement though so...

Of course the plant hero would have to be at full health to see if all three attacks occur. This could also be done with a line dancer but the second plant should then have more than 8 health.	yes, it would need to be in a friendly set up as for this combo to do 21-24 damages in 1 lane, everything would need to be just right including your opponent's health and block meter :D

3073		czjetfo	Drugs		"Alcohol and marijuana are completely different for me. 

When I'm high, everything becomes trippy and I am more out of it. It's harder for me to complete tasks (ex. using a microwave, cooking etc). It feels like my motor skills/speed has decreased, but I usually am able to catch/throw things as good as I can sober. Even though I am more out of it, I am told I become chill as fuck and I can keep my cool (even though it doesn't feel that way lmao). There is also a burnout period with weed, making you have an overwhelming need to sleep. Driving home is not impossible but HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. This is good for chill outs with your friends, solo-sessions, self reflection, listening to music and movie watching (no complex movies because I usually lose interest quick). Weed hangovers are a thing, but they don't physically hurt. My head is a bit light headed, and usually I get moderately depressed. Can last up to 2 days depending on how much you had.

When I'm drunk, my surroundings get desensitized to my brain, if that makes any sense. My motor skills/speed/spacial awareness feel the same, but in reality they're in the shitter. I become very flirty when drunk. I say the truth a lot (sometimes too much), and if I get too drunk I become very loud and make an ass out of myself. Alcohol (depending on the person) has a period cal the ""dizzies"" where you feel like [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/a/ae/Hyperspace_falcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20130312014242) is happening to you. Driving home is impossible when smashed, seriously get a cab. This is good for bars, social events, and meeting new people (all in moderate amounts, because drinking too much is not good in any situation). Alcohol hangovers are a thing obviously, causing heavy headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, lightheadedness and regret.

When mixing the two, both the desensitization and trippy combine, fucking me up. It's almost impossible for me to do anything (ex. last time I mixed I watched myself spill a whole box of cereal on the ground and was too fucked to clean it up). I'm still flirty, but not loud. Do not drive home when doing this, you will not have a good time. My body (specifically my face and fingertips) get really fuzzy, almost a pins and needles feeling, but it feels really good. I recommend more weed than alcohol when mixing, cause imo it feels better and it reduces hangover the next day. The hangover is a combination of the two others, so it's not pleasant. Mixing is good for house parties, clubs and concerts.

**td;lr - They're very different, combined they mix some qualities. Everyone is different, so this might not match exactly what you'd feel, but it'd be similar.**"

3076	czj4oek	czj5jn0	Accounting	"Various things that you may or may not have appreciated in  relation to this:

-working capital represents only the operating assets and liabilities of a business, it should exclude anything that is debt or debt like to show only the working capitalism position that is due to operating (not investing or financing) decisions.

-working capital EXCLUDES cash, which may seem odd. One way to understand working capital is that it is the opposite of cash from operating activities. When your working capital decreases, your cash goes up, when your working capital increases, your cash goes down

-because of this relationship, working capital represents the amount of cash trapped in the business that cannot be used to pay dividends, pay debt or invest in assets.

-the problem with just looking at the cash balance is that it is harder to work out areas of improvement, harder to compare trends to previous periods and also harder to work out whether your cash is being impacted by cash from operations, or cash from financing or investing. (Unless of course you use a cashflow statement, which requires calculation of working capital anyway!)"	"Also, you are right that low working capital is better, but of course companies need some level of WC to operate. (Eg if you are a retailer you could reduce your WC by selling down all your stock, but what happens after that!)

Therefore what you are really concerned with is looking at trends in working capital and understanding whether there are ways to decrease working capital without affecting other things. If you decrease working capital by $5m, this is $5m of cash available immediately to the company, sometimes working capital management is the difference between success and bankruptcy.

-looking at days of sales or purchases in working capital balances helps understand the operating cycle of a business, again something you can't do with cash. Eg if a company has 10 days of sales in debtors, this means it takes 10 days to convert sales into cash. If creditors are payable in 5 days, this means you have to pay your expenses quicker than you collect cash. Overall this means you have 5 days of working capital that the company has to finance somehow. Looking at days sales or purchases rather than absolute values lets you compare trends even if the company has grown or declined significantly. Again, you can't see this looking at the cash balance."

3098	dkzhvu8	dkzpdce	FindingFennsGold	"My point was that just because the search area has been narrowed by additional clues (I think that) most of us recognize the fact that the chances of finding the thing are still very very small. 

Many of us (including me) have come to realize after wasting some time and money, that we have to be MUCH more certain about a particular solve before we venture out again and spend time and money. We run our solves by others (family or friends), we try to eliminate ""confirmation bias"", we try to poke holes in our theories in every way possible. 

I've personally been back and forth between a place in Wyoming and another in New Mexico due to what I see are conflicts in two possible solutions. Both are pretty good, but I refuse to go until I feel that I can ""move with confidence"". If I still don't find it, then I'll chalk it up to another adventure and go back to the drawing board. 

On a personal note, I wasn't trying to disparage you - just wanted to say that it's not worth doing this if it's not fun. At least it wouldn't be for me."	"See, if I was one of those people who searched in Utah or Idaho, I would be pissed off....and that also goes for the Rio Grande Gorge and the hint that it is not under water as well.  Many people have spent millions of dollars looking in those states, areas, and places...and it's not fair to take them away after they have been searched by many.  Those two men who died in NM in my opinion died in vain, because he removed the area from the ""official map"" after the fact.  He should have just left everything as is and said, let the chips fall where they may.  I for one do not have anymore faith in Forrest Fenn because he removed the Gorge off of the official map.  If I were you, cjonesmo, I would save your money and forget about the treasure hunt, because at this point it's not about whether you have the correct solve or not, it's about whether Fenn is going to cut more areas away from his map.  I look at that map as a contract, not to be altered in anyway.....and Fenn to me is not abiding by the spirit of that contract with us searchers.  So in my opinion, I've been mislead up till now, and what changes may come to his map tomorrow, who knows?"

3114	dkz9bfv	dkzv4ur	AskReddit	I was house sitting in a huge house and set up a canary camera near my bedroom. I had an uneasy feeling someone else was in the house with me so I set up the camera just to make sure no one came near my room. In the middle of the night someone approached it from behind and turned it so it faced a blank wall. Then a few minutes later turned it back the way it was before. It tripped the canary and I got a notification on my phone. I saw it and searched the house thoroughly the next morning and never found anything. Needless to say, I slept with my door locked the rest of my time there. 	"Ugh this reminds me of the last and final time I house sat. I was watching my parents friends cat and since they had a pool and Wi-Fi (my parents didn't at the time) they let me stay at their house. It was very old, a very closed-off floor plan with tons of random doors and windows and a lot of hidden nooks. I never felt comfortable when I was there, but I just chalked it up to the house being old and creaky. 

One wednesday, after am unexpected half day, I get back to their house from work to feed the cat. Before doing anything else, I went to the bathroom. Even though I was there alone (or so I thought) I latched the hook lock. Im sitting there on the toilet and I watch the door get pushed gently to the extent that the hook would let it go, like someone was trying to very quietly see if they could get in. I told myself I was being stupid and that no one could be in there, I had locked all the doors every day. At the end of watching their house, I'm changing the bird feeder for the first time since I had been there and I noticed a door on the back porch that had been unlocked the whole time I was there. Every night I had slept there by myself, every time I heard noises and thought I was being stupid. The fucking house was wide open. "

3129		czjgnrz	CruciblePlaybook		It def takes getting used to, but yea once I started going for all head shots (as dumb as that sounds) I did very well with it today.  Surprisingly beat out a lot of snipers today as long as that first shot I land is a head shot, I assume it causes a lot of flinch
3130	dgyv2yn	dgyv3jc	AskOuija	I	[removed]
3131	dkzi71p	dkzqkkw	AskReddit	But it's not like these rankings are based on which universities appears in more movies.  	"But a lot of those rankings are heavily based on branding and favor the anglosphere.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings

for instance"
3132		czj9ohn	PurplePillDebate		Isn't it true that in the US women have always overwhelmingly voted democrat? This seems to much of a coincidence to just be swept under the rug, so I am inclined to agree that hormones do affect political views. Is this really that groundbreaking however? everything from your mood to the growth of body hair to the amount of muscle on your body is based upon the hormones in your body right now, this is relatively small in comparison.

3134		czj56uc	NASCAR		"RCR will come back strong. Dillon and Newman will be contenders.

Ganassi will come back even stronger. Both drivers make the Chase, and Larson gets multiple wins.

Roush does better, but they still aren't front runners consistently.

HScott gets some top 10's with Bowyer. Not much else other than that.

BK Racing is about as good as MWR was last year. Not good, but not horrible.

LFR gets some good finishes with Ty Dillon.

Front Row Motorsports possibly wins a race. A plate race, more than likely. Buescher and Cassill are very good plate racers."
3135	dgytoiu	dgyvkfr	Blackfellas	"A white lurker to me isn't an infiltrator. We may be pretty vocal and often very harsh in our feelings  of the white collective, but I think we are welcoming. 

What I meant was I wonder how many of the type of trolls referenced in this article are on this sub. There used to be a guy, GOPBlackGuy or something similar. He regularly posted how we should be good Christians, and bordered on how we should bow before whites. I feel like that guy was an infiltrator "	This sub and /r/blackladies are two of the most welcoming subs on the entire site.

3139		dkzwgmm	CasualConversation		Was playing a bit of Destiny after some Doom, I have to say, going from 100+ FPS to 30 takes a lot of getting used to.  Started listening to a Fallout 4 video essay and now I'm listening to music (The Forest Seasons by Wintersun, which is less exciting than I think everyone was hoping), all while drinking a Mortal Kombat beer.

3146	dkz5ykr	dkzu3xx	DarkAndLight	"I don't think Cohhcarnage needs to ""suck it up"", he's one of the biggest streamers on Twitch. Combat is a pretty fundamental thing for an RPG, something that certainly should have been working before opening the game up to EA."	"Theres a difference between ""working fine for our QA team of 30-100"" and ""working fine for 10 000 people crowding onto the servers at once"". That difference is EXACTLY what EA is for."

3159	dgyzb8a	dgz0vm9	SquaredCircle	"That PPV had no business being that good!

Swerves left, right and centre and not just stupid unpredictability, it was good unpredictability. Everyone was booked fairly strong, Shaesaro lost because of inexperience, Bayley lost because of a shoulder into the lower post (which sounded absolutely brutal), Randy lost because of Singh Bros and Jinder and Bray got his win and Jinder looks legit, and Roman actually lost for once. 

I had very little expectations for this PPV but damn, they really delivered on it. 

**I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU!!**"	It was a great PPV in my opinion. Helps that almost everyone I wanted to win, did.
3160		dgysq5s	AskReddit		"Now my dad would hit me without warning pretty often, but it was in a playful manner. I remember  walking down the steps and telling my dad I was gonna drive over to a friend's house. As I was turning for the door, he told me wait and he then punched me dead in the chest. He told not to fuck 
anything up and have a fun time. My mom was the same way. We would play fight and shadow box all the time. She bloodied my nose with a left hook one day...good times."
3161	dgytecv	dgythbs	LetItDie	You just need to hit them with a fish.  Brain shrooms don't work.  	Well you saved me a death. I'll probably try it tomorrow. I'm all burnt out. I did ten floors and a ton of grinding in two days.

3165	czj2oev	czj6ltd	Paranormal	Imaginary friends are not unusual in young children, they even often give them a reduplicated name like that. It isn't a  paranormal thing. 	But occasionally the imaginary friend isn't imaginary.

Whenever you go to such appointments, do not disclose you are going to ADAPT to anyone in your chain but just a general doctor's appointment or something along those lines.

3170	dgyx5ej	dgyxkmh	Portland	"> I don't talk to many people in this town. I tried playing nice at first, but when I realized how fake and pretentious everyone around here is, I didn't waste my time anymore.

""People quickly learned how awful I was and stopped inviting me out, I decided that I don't need friends anymore and that's my decision not anyone else's...MY DECISION.""

>People who interact with me generally appreciate my honesty and the fact that I don't feel the need to impress people.

""I found a few other fringe characters that meet my boring blue collar expectations. I ***CHOSE*** to keep these ones around because they meet my narrow minded view of the world."""	"Well yeah, it was my decision to give up on meeting anyone here. I didn't say otherwise. I have a low tolerance for fake people, so after some time, I stopped making the effort. Never let anyone close enough to me to find out if I was awful or not. It only takes one conversation to see how badly a person is TRYING to impress you, and I'm not of the type to TRY to impress anyone. That's pathetic.

I would say that people CHOSE to keep me around. I fucked up all my relationships with everybody during my 10 plus year drinking career. I gave everyone the chance to break it off cleanly, and I wouldn't have blamed them. If someone thought I had fucked up enough to the degree that they didn't want to associate with me, I never begged them, nor do I hold it against them. Most of my friends who have seen the best and worst of me. Guess they thought the best outweighed 10 plus years of being a shitty person though, because they CHOSE to remain friends."

3178		czjesu2	LifeProTips		The problem that you face is that you've built up a tolerance to the consequences. Making the same bad decisions repeatedly means you have a callous to the negative effects that come after. What you have to do now is learn to appreciate the positive that comes from NOT making those mistakes.
3179		dgys8cx	Fitness		"No. Why would I watch an old man giving his opinion on other guys in thongs posing?

3180		czj5p4r	AskReddit		I live in the southern U.S., and I hear a lot of mispronunciations:  Pillow=piller, corner=co-ner, and back there=back air. There are a lot more, but I can't think of them all right now.
3181		dgyve3p	QuotesPorn		I like the quote, but Lincoln didn't live by that principle. He suspended habeas corpus and ordered the slaughter of innocents. 
3182	dgyyfoi	dgyyh29	SquaredCircle	Who's saying that? I'm just seeing people say this is Alexas best match yet 	A lot of people are saying this is Bayley's best match
3183		dgyy7ac	TrueAtheism		I recommend reading philosophical books. I used to be a Christian but lost my faith and converted to atheism. I understand what you are saying. I am currently a philosophy major and existential philosophy can really help. Try reading Kierkegaard, Camus, Satre, and most importantly Nietzsche. They are all atheist except Kierkegaard but even he gives good advice about how to deal with anxiety when we realize the shit-storm of a world we live in. These philosophers try and teach what do in the face of the nihilistic meaningless world we live in, which when realized can really dampen ones mood. Hope this helps and good luck. Cheers
3184	czj6p3x	czj8r4x	Documentaries	[verwijderd]	You're missing the point and being needlessly defensive.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to have your own first-hand experience of something instead of relying strictly on what your government and movie industry tell you.

But he it would not surprise me if he was."	Ended up looking up his agency page. He is indeed a model - it's how he entered the entertainment industry.

3198	dgy4yyv	dgz1kns	Advice	[verwijderd]	Really bad. Investments in apps fall out. Everyone stops buying apps basically. Think dotcom vrash but worldwide and 10 times worse. Short term there is just gonna be a shittonne of ads to make their money back. Lots of ugly brand deals. Apps disappearing from the appstore if they had no money. Apple removing things that don't make them money.

3207	dgyr7nv	dgyz1eo	PublicFreakout	There doesn't need to be a specific law addressing this, though I believe there is in many states. It's covered under general self defense provided you perceived imminent harm. 	Okay, sure.  But for everyone else reading this, realize that self-defense is an affirmative defense, so you are presumed to be guilty and the burden of proof is on you to show that you were in imminent danger.
3208	dgyrje3	dgyumvy	HateCrimeHoaxes	">White means European ancestry. You know that, but you're just being cute. 

What is ""European""? Europe as a concept comes from the very limited worldview of ancient greeks. And even they didn't put weight into it in terms of an identity, as they certainly didn't feel more connected with other ""Europeans"" than they did the Indo-Iranians to the east.

>Races do exist, any ""scholar"" that tries to prove otherwise is just really trying to redefine scientifically proven genetic clusters as ""socially constructed."" (As liberals who can't find jobs outside of academia tend to do.)

The way you phrase this shows that you have no understanding of what they're even saying. Those who say race is a social construct don't deny the fact that there are genetic clusters of people.

>I'm sure there's a name for the logical fallacy of cherry-picking examples to disprove the rule, but I don't know what it is.

How am I cherry picking? Most of the ""nations"" of earth have formed in the last 300 years as a result of colonialism. Either one people had conquered another, resulting in boarders being based on politics as recent as that, or one people had been overlords of another and then drew borders with little regard for those who live there. This is true for almost all countries in the Americas, the Pacific, or Africa, while also being true for quite a few of those in the Middle East, South Asia or Southeast Asia."	"I think we both agree on historical facts, we just differ on interpretation.  There is no denying European people have a specific genetic signature.  ""Identifying"" with something is obviously subjective, and would logically be different for Europeans on the Med than say, the ones who built stone henge."

R1: Sloane 24D 9CL 13CP 4T 0G vs GWS

Danger 24D 5CL 15CP 9T 3G vs Freo

R2: Sloane 25D 8CL 15CP 15T 1G vs Hawks

Danger 37D 11CL 25CP 6T 1G vs North

R3: Sloane 31D 8CL 24CP 9T 1G vs Port

Danger 36D 9Cl 20CP 2T 3G vs Melbourne

Total:

Sloane 80D, 25CL, 52CP, 28T, 2G

Danger 97D, 25CL, 60CP, 17T, 7G

**Discussion:**

Dangerfield is on top for all listed stats other than equal in Clearances after 3 rounds. An arguement can however be made for the quality of opponents. Adelaide faced and beat fellow top 5 opponents in GWS and Port Adelaide, as well as the lowly Hawks. Geelong faced Freo (11th after 6 rounds), North (15th after 6 rounds), and Melbourne (8th after 6 rounds). Note that Geelong only narrowly won vs North.

Dangerfield has the stats, but has accumulated these stats in a team lacking midfield strength and facing lowly opponents. 

Sloane is only slightly behind in stats, and would be considered Elite for all, and has versed much tougher opponents. 

**Verdict:**

Both are good stop fighting.

"New Year Byakuya is a powerful counter against Grimmjows which make up the vast majority of arena team compositions (take a look at the top 10). The 4* New Years Ichigo is decent but I myself still need to do a lot more leveling on mine to make a final decision if he is worth it.

I'd strongly recommend leveling your 5* Renji only to get a multi-colored PVP team atleast until you pull another 5* or 4* worthy PVP unit. I'd recommend saving all orbs you get for future events (judging off the new theme we should have an event coming up for valentines day)."

In terms of writing, my biggest criticism is pacing. It's always been my contention that she should've been introduced as an NPC much earlier in the game so that we could get little snapshots of her personality or her opinions on current events.

Conversely, my biggest criticism of Makoto is that she gets a lot of the spotlight compared to other Thief characters.

3371	czjfopj	czjgdrm	CCW	"It's an interesting question because one seemingly possible outcome wouldn't be good for us carriers: petty crimes could get a lot more deadly.

Imagine there was a 50/50 chance someone you were going to, let's say mug, had a gun.  That'd be a significant increase from what it is today, but let's go with it.  Given that scenario, a perpetrator really has two choices:  (a) play the odds and go in unarmed, or (b) attack violently and swiftly to ensure their own safety, at the very possibly mortal expense of yours.

Now, the obvious retort is that someone that's just interested in your wallet may not be a violent criminal much of the time and will take option (c), which is to be dissuaded from the crime entirely.  Obviously, that's the possibility we who advocate carrying would say is the most likely, and certainly the most desirable.  I mean, it's certainly true that someone intend on mugging you isn't necessarily willing to go the next step of murdering you for the possibility of a few dollars.

But, some certainly may be.  And, if the economy took a nosedive and people were very desperate for example, an otherwise not life-threatening mugging might become a life-or-death thing because the mugger may decide it's better for them to shoot you in the back of the head and take your wallet then risk getting shot themselves.  If they're really that desperate for the money then the idea of killing someone for it may not seem as far-fetched as it once did, and if that's true then simply killing you before you have a chance to respond is in their best interests (to their warped mind I mean)."	That's when I take my family into the hills and take our chances with the animals.

And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of *any* objections. People don't act like that for no reason.

It's honestly more sad than anything else.  How people can be so mis-informed is just beyond me.  I personally blame The Guardian and the sad lack of economics education in school.

I don't understand how someone can say something so flat-out wrong as:

&gt;f it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

And be taken seriously.  It's just amazing how little interest in reality this place has.

&gt;If it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

This is just wrong.  A flat out lie.  There is no evidence to suggest this and I don't know why you'd bother writing it out.

&gt;And it won't operate for ten years - solar is cheaper.

Solar and coal don't compete as solar is intermittent and requires large amounts of redundancy.  When solar is capable of running at all times we might be having a different conversation.

&gt;This is the economic reality.

No, it is not.  This is a lie to fit your priors.

&gt;Your whole act on this subreddit is pretending that you are the ""smart guy"" who ""faces the realities of economics"" (which by some bizarre coincidence always lines up with the Murdoch/Coalition party line) - so how can you justify promoting coal?

Because India lives in horrific poverty and coal allows them to rise out of it.  The 100% renewable study commissioned required India to be 1/7th as wealthy as us.  I'm not comfortable with consigning a sixth of the planet to abject poverty because they had the misfortune to develop after us.

Also yes, I do promote economic reality.  It should say something that I then line up with the LNP a whole heap more than the ALP.  Something about the ALP being a bunch of incompetent buffoons lying to the Australian people.

&gt;If we give a billion dollars to these scam artists we will never get it back.

Ok.  I'm not going to pay back my home loan.  That's how these things work lmao.

&gt; That's why the banks are refusing to back it.

They're refusing to back it because the federal ALP are refusing to back it.  This is known as sovereign risk.

&gt;Their economic modelling, no doubt dismissed by the likes of you as ""lefty nonsense"", shows that the mine will be a failure.

Then it will be a failure.  That's fine.  The infrastructure will not solely be used by Adani.

&gt;And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of any objections.

Reasonable objections have been met.  This is probably the most stringently regulated mine in the history of the world.

Every other objection requires it to be blocked through legislative fiat, which the party of free markets will not do.

Now people on discord think I'm foolish trying to help you since they keep saying you aren't open to change, so I'm offering to give you quirk ideas, hell I'll even come up with some quirks for you depending on what type of quirk you want and I'll help you with your stats as well plus with anything else you need. Please let me help you man.....becuase I'll tell you again if you go ahead and use ""Flower Spam"" again I won't be able to help you and I can give guarantee that you won't make in any tournament as long as you stitck to that op quirk "	"Nah is alright man thanks, i think is better to give up on this one if internet teach me something is that once you fuck it up there is no coming back people don't forget anything, thanks for ofering your help it's really apreciated but I think is better that I get down, if i'm not mistaken the Boku no hero fandom is not presisely known for being understanding (no meme rule, seriously?) 

You are an exception throught we need more people like you

I hate communities that do this kind of things, i can repair the quirk and even add or quit some things but you say is no use, that ""flower spam"" already has an stigma so it's going to be rejected even if it's good to go just because people hated the original... ok im done i'm not here for this shits thanks again man (or woman idk) but i'm done

Don't worry about ideas, i have several, i'm going to tell you something ""flower spam"" was the sixth on the list of possible quirks for this, i choose it because it was funny and really diferent to anything i see before, unique you can say, in a begining it was just that, spam flowers, useless right? but then i start thinking

¿Can flowers grow in any surface, or just in soil?

¿Can flowers grow in living beings? 

¿Another creation quirks use something to create things, they didn't appear from thin air, what does the flowers use? 

I like the idea, I began to plan things, start writing concepts, organizing my ideas, etc, four days later i was good to go and even then is incomplete

the other quirks i have planned we're rejected because 

a) they were to similar to other quirks, both from this page and from the series

b) they we're stupidly op

And since i write this another ideas came to my mind

Just three of the ideas i think off

Muscle presure: this quirk allows the user to put strain in their muscle compresing them allowing to use the 100% of the human muscle power or even increase it beyond the human limit, more than 100% 

Rejected because it was to similar to one for all, it's weakness even where that the strain the body goes after using the quirk break the users body

Golden form: the user can transform for several seconds into a special form that heavily increase the strength, agility, endurance, etc, and gives the power to fly, after it's use the user collapse from tireness

It is based on the súper saiyan yes, but I don't think it was that usefull, i wanted to create a quirk that can be use effectively in tandem alongside the users own capabilities, this was more like a ""last resort"" attack so no

Magnetization: the user can magnetize his body to atract metalic objects from his sourroundings to use them as weapon, armour etc, he needs to be carefull or otherwise the objective can travel to fast an knock him down with a powerfull blow

To boring

Anyway hope i see you around, again thanks for anything"

This is my local shop but it is not OPs. The judge is co-owner and son of the shop owner. The shop owner has been difficult over the last few months and was frustrated that so few people came to the GPT. The only people that came were locals (plus OP who was local but has recently moved away) so the event was smaller than he expected. I believe that that favoritism played the biggest role in this. I can't imagine anyone else in the event would have this rule applied to them except OP wasn't local. 

The honest truth from my perspective, is I dodged the hardest match-up in the quarter-finals because of this, and was able to role to the finals easier because of this.

Just to make life more fun, a tip for cloakies, if there is a dictor anywhere near you, do not try to warp, if you do, and he bubbles, you'll stop. Instead, double click in a random direction, cloak, mwd, then change direction by 90 degrees, but not too sharply or you'll stall."	"A small detail to add - there *is* such thing as ""too much speed"" when you're trying to decloak smaller ships, and I'd recommend not overloading your MWD when trying to decloak.

First, a few basics; then, an illustrated explanation:

 * Use the Centered Tracking camera setting to always get a reliable angle on their position when they decloak.

 * Always double-click in space instead of clicking the decloaked target and approaching, because once an object ""no longer exists"" in Eve (destroyed, cloaked, warped off-grid, etc.) your vector of movement gets messed up in most cases.

OK, so:

**1.** [Here you are in your Sabre](http://i.imgur.com/IGaCz0I.jpg), which has its own collision model. The covops also has its own collision model. Your goal is to get within 2000m (global decloak radius) from the *edge* of the pinata's collision model.

**2.** [You start burning at the guy (let's assume meh skills and a nano)](http://i.imgur.com/Btiso70.jpg). The covops will only decloak if *during a given tick* your collision model intersects with their model+decloak radius. In the case of this Sabre, there are two ticks during which you'll get a decloak, so that's good.

**3.** You might be tempted to overload your MWD so you can ohmygodgettohimbeforehegetsoutofmybubble. Thing is, [when you overload your MWD you are basically spreading apart your collision-per-tick spheres farther](http://i.imgur.com/feMKByN.jpg). In this example it doesn't look so bad, because you had a really good vector in the first place. 

**4.** But yeah, don't do that. Why? Well, say that your trajectory is a little bit off. [In fact, here's the closest possible edge case](http://i.imgur.com/jnRRFwa.jpg). Basically you can see that you are actually passing too quickly through the sphere formed by the covops's modelRadius+2000m. For comparison, [here's the exact same vector without your prop overloaded](http://i.imgur.com/0vO9PBL.jpg). The more you increase speed beyond a reasonable number, the more you start counterproductively decreasing your allowable margin of error for your approach vector. Going too fast might even mean drifting out of heated scram range despite getting a successful decloak.

**5.** It seems like a really pedantic point to make when you consider the range of speed of Interdictors, I'll admit. If you need some training wheels for a bit, just drop a second bubble along the way. But keep in mind that it becomes *really* important when you're in something like a fleet ceptor, though, since those are so fast and their model sizes are too small.

----

**Summary:** You want the ""right"" speed for decloaking, not the ""highest speed"": decloaking is tick-based and &gt;3km/s~ you might actually start fucking yourself over. Fleet interceptors may want to attempt to decloak at below max speed.

Rank 105, team cost 120

Current Team:Divine Warden U&Y, Duke Vampire Lord, Princess Valkyrie, Enchantress of the Sea, Siren, Lilith

Non IAP

Stopped playing for a while, only checking in to collect stones and occasionally roll. Wondering if there's a better team I can put together/target with what I have now. 
"	"Yes.  Yes there is.  There are, in fact, several better teams you can put together.  Your 120 cost is still going to slow things down until you rank up, but we'll work with what we can.  

1.  Devil team.  You have 2 red sonias, therefore you have a devil team.  Sonia / Sonia / Vampire / [King Baddie](http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=688) / Zuoh / Lilith or Lucifer // friend Beelzebub is a great devil team.  Now, it's way too expensive, so you'd need to rank up a lot.  Tone it down a bit and use Sonia / Vampire / King Baddie /  Big Baddie / Lilith // friend Beelzebub for a 103 cost version that'll get you started.  

2.  Urd is a great fire team leader.  Urd / Cao Cao / Ares / Yamato Takeru / Chiyome is a solid fire TPA team.  100 cost in the current forms you have, so you can run that, too.  Evolve your monsters as your cost increases and you can afford to - Urd first.  

3.  Bastet.  You have a great Bastet setup: Bastet / Vishnu / Meimei / 2 from [Susano (for shield) / Freyja (damage boost) / Meimei2 (more boards) / Vishnu2 (more TPAs).  Pair with Verdandi or Awoken Bastet.  This is actually an endgame-potential team, once you level up, evolve, and awaken everything.  The current iteration is right around 100 cost, depending on which flex subs you take, so it's also affordable.  

4.  Freyja.  She's got a new buddy in Sylvie, so if you can find a Sylvie friend and run them together, she's very powerful.  I'd go Freyja / Michael / Meimei / Bastet / Vishnu // Sylvie friend.  Also affordable for you.  

5.  If you can evolve your DMeta, you can run DMeta / Satsuki / Persephone / Lucifer / dark flex (whatever you can afford, this will be hard given ult DMeta is 70 by herself).  Ultimate Dark Metatron is extremely powerful, so this would be a ""something to work towards"" team.  

Try out those teams, get a feel for them, and see what you end up enjoying most.  It's good to work on a few teams, since sometimes one breezes through where another gets stopped, but you really have a lot to work with.  "

If I am, I look them in the eye because it's easier to understand what they are trying to get across, whether that be the words themselves or the subtext that they aren't specifically saying. 

What do you prefer? A person that looks you in the eye for 2 seconds, then looks away, then back again? To me that's rude and shows a lack of confidence. Unless it's a cultural thing"

Rumble clearly isn't fully motivated in MMA anymore. Rumble just wants Dana to offer him $500k to get in the Octagon with Jon, throw a flurry, get taken down and then submitted.

3495	dgyuvyu	dgyv679	SkincareAddiction	Hi can you tell me what product exactly do you mean by oil cleansing? I use Stridex currently and it does reduce SF on my nose, but there's still a good bit. 	"Oil cleansing is exactly what it sounds like-/ instead of a traditional face wash, you use some kind of oil to cleanse your face. [the wiki has lots of useful info on OCM](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) although I have a small disagreement with the How To: you should apply oil to your *dry* face, not wet. Massage the oil gently into your skin, then rinse away. If you are using straight oils you may need to use a damp washcloth to get rid of residue. If you're using a commercial oil cleansing product it probably has emulsifiers in it so the reside will rinse away. 

I myself has used various different oils-- from straight up mineral oil or olive oil to store night oil cleansers. I am currently obsessed with [this Palmer's](http://www.target.com/p/palmers-skin-therapy-cleansing-oil-face-6-5-oz/-/A-49111078?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;amp;CPNG=PLA_Health+Beauty+Shopping&amp;amp;adgroup=SC_Health+Beauty&amp;amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;device=m&amp;amp;location=9003386&amp;amp;gclid=CNf3utXCzdMCFQSHswod2SAI4Q&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) cleanser and have been using it for the last year or so.

Back in the 90s I was an associate working at our local department store, in Housewares, Toys and Sports. Russ Trolls were all the rage for some reason, and we had both TV and print ads selling these ugly things for $14.99. We also had a cheaper and larger version by another company for $12.99.

This male customer got into an argument with the department manager because he SWORE the Russ Trolls were $12.99, and he DEMANDED he be sold one at $12.99. Soon into the argument his wife stormed over to the manager and claimed she saw the TV ad showing the Russ Trolls at $12.99 (nope, we had a copy of the ads in the office).

They got so loud and obnoxious that soon there were what had to have been nearly 20 adults, ALL yelling and demanding the Russ Trolls for $12.99. They actually ran down the doll aisle to grab them before we had the head of security finally restore some semblance of order and told the crowd that he would take their names and phone numbers and give them a call once everything was ""sorted out"".

> however the emergence of a slew late night comedians delving full on into the world of politics with blatant political agendas of their own (Colbert, Samantha Bee, Olvier himself) and hide behind a facade of entertainment is far more insidious.

which is an insane finish after a few rather moot points."	How exactly is this an insane finish? When the sum total of the numbers of viewers and followers of Last Week Tonight alone more than double those of InfoWars, it would seem apparent that Oliver would have just as much sway in the realm of politics as Jones in terms of the average American. It is one thing to shine the light on a news organization founded on conspiracy and outright falsehoods. But he acts as though this fringe element is more dangerous to the general populace despite the fact that Jones clearly presents himself as the head of a media element with a very open agenda. Oliver presents his show as having researched findings (dozens of which distort the truth or fail to tackle an issue from more than one perspective) while peppering these segments with personal attacks and fabrications of his own. This tactic, which can be seen coming from Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, and the like, leads to days of media coverage from official news organizations who extol these programs as though they contain an ounce of journalistic integrity. These same comedians will then boast and proudly declare themselves a line of defense against fake news when they seek to bolster a particular world view, regardless of facts. However, when such criticisms are directed their way, comedians like Oliver will simply claim to be pure entertainers, knowing full well the effects of their shows on the political sphere. The same arguments would hold even if his attacks were directed at CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.

1) Try using a larger/longer wiper blade on the upper wiper arm, so that it wipes the area directly in front of the camera lens.  Depending on how the windshield molding is shaped, you might excessively bend the upper inch or two of wiper blade, so you'll hae to replace it more frequently.

2) Move your camera lens over to the right a couple of inches.  Depending on the specific design/setup of your dash-cam, you might be able to do this by flipping the camera around (left-end on right, right-end on left), or shift the camera as installed a couple of inches.

OTOH, we know the church actually does support higher learning and science (just look at the STEM programs at BYU and the research they do, etc.). 

How can people reconcile the conflict between ""keep things simple / don't think too much"" and the need to think and analyze the world around us?"	"I'm not sure where you're getting the ""don't try to learn too much"" from this talk. I didn't sense that reading it.

We'd always hook up while her husband was at work, being that he neither had his drivers license or could even drive at all, there was no chance of him walking in on us. So one day I show up for a romp and we get down and dirty, and after we finish I casually ask ""hey do you have a towel or something i can use to clean up?"" and she tosses me some cloth and I wipe myself off. It wasn't until after that i realized she had given me her husbands pajama pants and i wiped our sexjuices off on his pants.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."

That doesn't seem correct to me, but did anything in the game actually happen?  I know the PoV ceremony was today and that Paul took Jason down, but what made the whole blow up happen?	"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."

> Even today, it’s a mishmash by province, and the strains of the system are evident in months- to years-long waits for low-priority treatments such as back surgeries and hip replacements. **Wealthy Canadians can, and do, travel to the United States to receive these treatments.** And they pay for what they get locally, too, in taxes: The nation spends an average of $5,000 per person on health care each year.

I'm tired of hearing this when it's not true. Everyone seems to have a story about their wealthy friend who ran down to Detroit because they were sick of waiting for an MRI, but data just doesn't support the idea that this is an epidemic or anything more than a *very* uncommon occurrence by only the wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians. 

[This widely-cited, peer-reviewed study from 2002](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full) used multiple strategies to evaluate Canadian-to-US healthcare crossings—including contacting hospitals in Washington, Michigan and New York and contacting the 50 best-known and best-ranked hospitals in the United States—and concluded that **""Results from these sources do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States**. Indeed, **the numbers found are so small as to be barely detectible** relative to the use of care by Canadians at home."" [Here's a comprehensive video that cites the study, as well as several other myths about our healthcare system.](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0?t=3m58s)

None of this is to blunt the criticism against Trudeau—he certainly didn't enable our healthcare system to become what it is—but this is a myth that I'm tired of seeing."	How do they obtain personal medical information to come to their conclusions?

For instance, my friend was fired for ""sweeping the floor wrong"", whatever that's supposed to mean. Never did find out which it was. Creepydude died 15 ish years ago I heard. He and his wife didn't live in town, they lived in an rv and only came to town in the summer. That was the reason given for the bed in the basement, but it conveniently gave ol' Chuck ample material for ""jokes"" to the 14 year old girls. 


And before anyone asks: in my state you could get a work permit to work for a real paycheck at 14 if your parents signed it saying it was ok. "
3645	dgyr7li	dgys7z7	Rainbow6	are you ignoring the fact that you can shoot through most floors?	"Is that your solution to the bunker operator you're suggesting?

Clubhouse Garage, Chalet Garage, House Garage, Yacht Casino, Yacht Subroom, most of Bank's rooms, those are some of the zones/objective areas where your idea would absolutely obliterate everything. You want Montaigne with his extended shield, a recoilless LMG that kills in 2 shots, and 60 bullets per mag."

3647	dgytbhn	dgyxe2g	Broduce101	"> last place as of ep 4 is an A rank.

wtf Mnet pls"	That's from just the live votes + 3000 benefit points. Sangbin was #55 in ep 3, which was the last episode to reveal online vote rankings, thank goodness.
3648	cziv3fb	czj5p6o	AskReddit	"This was asked yesterday and here was my response:

Personal favorites aside from stuff that hasn't been mentioned this far:

How Did This Get Made(Comedy) : June Diane Raphael, Paul Scheer, and Jason Mantzoukas plus guest discuss bad films. 

Risk! (storytelling): my favorite storytelling podcast. Hosted by Kevin Allison(formerly of The State), people tell true stories that are funny, scary, deeply emotional, et cetera. 

Last Podcast on the Left(comedy/horror): these guys discuss all things scary with a bit of comedy mixed in. Their serial killers editions are probably the best. 

Honorable mention... 

We're Alive(serial audio drama): probably the best audio drama out there. It's a zombie apocalypse one in the vein of TWD, but I dig it and they're about a half hour long per episode. 

Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/43f0nu/i_know_nothing_about_podcasts_what_would_be_an/"	I tried to listen to Risk but the host is just obnoxious as all hell :/
3649		czjenvf	Charlotte		Comrads, instead of attacking each other, why do t we make a common enemy out of Atlanta ga. or that backwards hole called Gastonia?
3650		dkzww3i	PUBATTLEGROUNDS		yes. they've said they plan to launch a squad version, but they want to test things like FoV and such first to try and iron out any issues. being as squad is the most popular server and has the highest amount of players, its not good for ironing out issues.
3651		dgyyeeq	AskWomen		"In the 8th grade I hit a major bout of depression. I only ate maybe one small meal a day, which was dinner with my family. I was 110 lbs and 5'5"". It was really bad, as some days I'd skip dinner too by taking depression naps.

The summer between 8th and 9th grade I started dating my SO and he gently encouraged me to start eating more regularly. It hurt so much to eat more than one meal a day and it made me nauseous. I felt like I just couldn't fit more than one meal a day in me.

I'm now ending my freshman year of college and I'm within an average weight range for my height and age. I still don't eat a lot, maybe one meal and a few snacks throughout the day. If I eat ""too much"", which usually is a big plate full of food, I feel sick and in pain, but I can eat more than I could before. I still have days where I don't feel hungry and I don't wsnt to eat, but I force myself to anyways because of how easily I can go without food now"
3652		dkzr65r	ChapoTrapHouse		I think at this point his ideology is just second-option bias. The cultural Marxist regressive left hates him? He must be worth listening to!
3653		dgywq2q	Greekgodx		What a totally baseless, shitty thing to say.
3654	czj5582	czja0w9	Showerthoughts	"This is a mistake made by many, many, many people.

**YOU CANNOT GET A SIX PACK WITH SIT UPS ALONE. YOU NEED TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AS WELL.**"	"Only if you are fat to begin with. Which is most Americans. Which started this fucking annoying excuse that abs are made in the kitchen. They are not. I've always been below 10% body fat and my abs didn't show until I trained them. 

Sure. Everybody has ""abs"" but you really can't see them without working out unless you're fuckig 6% body fat or less. 

"
3655		dkzw76b	Mariners		Canó pls
3656	czjdz7t	czjeam4	BDSMcommunity	[verwijderd]	"Hm. I think it depends on the sub. Chastity and orgasm denial have its place, but it's rarely forever. Guys put up with it because when sex does happen, when an orgasm is allowed, it's usually mind-blowingly awesome if the denial and the chastity was done correctly for their specific personalities. 

I have heard of nonsexual power exchange, especially from married couples where one person is kinky and the other is not, and no one is comfortable quite yet with their significant other having a sexual relationship with another. The ironic part is that D/s and power exchange is so intimate even without sex. 

It does seem common for straight Dommes to be into chastity. Whether that's a straight female thing or not is beyond my wisdom though. ha. I'm not male but I'm with you. A sexless relationship is -not- what I want and I would end a relationship that turned out to be sexless.

3659		czjfwdu	skiutah		"The chutes around Paradise are a sweet start. Powder Country is always good for cutting fresh lines/trees. If you can rip Lightning Ridge or James Peak....you are winning the game. Powder Mountain isn't the toughest mountain in terms of ""pitch"" but has some of the gnarliest terrain around if ya know where to look."

3661	dkzr75a	dkzxm6r	DaystromInstitute	"I thought ""transwarp"" was a catchall term for all technologies that go faster than warp 10.

This would include the quantum slipstream, transwarp, both STIII and Voyager, underspace, and the method used in ""The Voyager Conspiracy""."	Faster than typical warp, yes. Warp 10 is infinite (in the TNG scale), so you can't go faster than that. 
3662		dgytotf	SkincareAddiction		You should try the Simple replenishing rich moisturizer. It is tailored for sensitive skin and is also dimethicone free. My pores clog crazy easily and this is the only thing I have found works for me. It is really inexpensive also. 
3663		dkzrila	Paranormal		I used to work at Disney California Adventure and had a minor run in with the little girl that haunts Buena Vista Street's Trolley Treats store. She apparently is a little prankster and I thought it was funny.
3664		dgyubxv	AskReddit		Id say I've got one close friend. Since middle school. We talk about everything and hang out often. Tak often. Game often. Pretty much got eachothers backs. Thats how friends should be
3665		czj7vn1	Surface		"If they are not responding, maybe you should look elsewhere. Could be a scammer looking for quick cash.

3670	czgkg1s	czj671x	Bitcoin	"> and 2MB hard fork is clearly not destructive for the network and decentralization.

This is my whole frustration.  2MB isn't going to break anything or cause centralization, so why can't everyone get onboard with it?  I understand not moving to 20MB or 200MB, but 2MB?  What's the big deal?  Do people think it'll be a slippery slope or something?"	"Why are you whining like a baby over 2MB when 1.75MB is already being rolled out? Are you that pathetic that you can't wait for the next doubling already on the horizon on the roadmap?

There's not a single valid reason you can come up with to do 2MB before SW. But since you already buried your head in the sand earlier you put yourself in a position where you'd lose face if you don't get your demands met.

You've been given plenty of opportunity to get your head out of your ass without much loss of face.

The mere fact that you think there's even a possibility of setting demands and making compromises displays the degree of misunderstanding you have. This is science at work not some miss America competition."

3679		dkztr10	FFBraveExvius		"Delita is evil. He is the monster that he sought to destroy and while he is perhaps sympathetic, he murders or betrays everyone in his quest for power. Ovelia tries to give him his just rewards but unfortunately fails.

You have a very....generous interpretation of events. I haven't played either version since the WotL release on PSP, but I've played this game a dozen times so I'm gonna try and poke at them.

&gt;Delita then uncovers a traitorous councilor to Goltanna and executes him, earning Goltanna's favor. 

My impression is that the councilor was a fall guy for Delita's actions, who actually was the spy. It's possible he was another spy, but likely Delita simply framed him for the Hokuto plot and murdered him to get him out of the way and gain Goltana's trust. The only evidence is a witness that Delita himself provides, and he kills him before any objections can be made.


&gt; Delita successfully kills Goltanna, but instead of killing Orlandeau, Delita kills a lookalike and lets the real TG Cid go with Ramza in his search for the church's true goal. Delita then assumes Goltanna's position as head of the Southern Sky.

I've seen the idea that Delita let Orlandu go, but this is highly unlikey. The stand-in that Delita kills is a member of the Glabados church provided for the purpose of framing Orlandu for Goltana's murder (this is explicit in the japanese version that he's a member of the church). There's no reason to let Orlandu go except to betray the Templar knights (of which Delita is a member), and there's no way the church would provide a stand-in to help betray themselves. Further, Orlandu walks away with one of the Auracites when Ramza busts him out of jail. Considering the Templars gave him that stone, they had to have known that Orlandu escaped with it and Delita killed a stand-in or else they would have come looking for their stone to give to someone else to use.


&gt; At the same time, Valmafra, learning of Delita's betrayal as he speaks to Orran, struggles to carry out her orders to kill Delita. Delita senses her hesitation, and taunts her to kill him. Instead, Valmafra abandons her orders and serves Delita.

Does she? Or does he just capture her until after he becomes king?

&gt; Finally, Orran tries to uncover the church's plot and is burned at the stake as a heretic; it is unknown what power Delita had to stop this event.

The power of being the most powerful man in the country. If Delita didn't want Orran to die, he wouldn't have let Orran die.

&gt;  Delita spared Ramza several times, as well as spared Orlandeau

The second is questionable at best. The first is just not true. Delita never tries to fight Ramza, and given that he relies on Ramza to slay the Lucavi instead of trying to do so himself, it's unlikely he would have emerged triumphant. He probably also knew this having grown up with him, and hence never tried. Besides, as you point out, Ramza was needed for that whole Lucavi problem.

Delita MEANS well, but he becomes a black-hearted fiend at the end. Ovelia recognized it. Everyone else should as well."

There are medical conditions people don't know about, family trauma that isn't as simple as an abusive or narcissistic parent (not that I'm downplaying those by any means), and lastly there are things that we can be exposed to that simply change us permanently and there really isn't any going back.   Attempting to explain these things to others usually ends with them being trivialized or marginalized because nobody likes hearing about a problem that can't be explained in under a minute, because then they regret having asked the question.   Remember that many times when people ask the question, ""what's wrong?"",  they don't actually want to know,  they just want the dopaminic release that comes with the belief that you somehow helped somebody with 45 seconds of listening.    Sometimes you just have to carry it with you and keep it to yourself.  And if you do find someone that actually cares, that spends the time to fully comprehend what it is you are going through, then you better make time for them as well, because they are rare and they deserve a full listen as well.

Excellent parking mode is: Automatically enable/disable (lackluster is very painful in this department), Buffered recording (able to record a few seconds before, and after action detected), low power when in use (only writes to micro SD card when motion activated detected), voltage cut off feature (to protect battery.)

&gt; 2. Is having a parking mode feature worth it?

So is it worth it, well dual cameras definitely [improve parking mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGWGX1t8DU0). Do you back into the spot 100% of the time? Most don't. Even if you do, [you can be hit from behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhIXOxjyko).

Hardwiring is a little more difficult, I actually like GPS (speed/location only not directions), built in Wifi definitely improves your ability to check video, change settings, over a LCD screen. Some of the Parking mode dash cams have Cloud feature (stream anywhere - paid feature) and cellphone notifications of G sensor activation(s) while in park mode (generally free feature.) Some have excellent night mode, like the Thinkware F770 2 CH. 


Others are simply vehicle on dash cams, like the A119 - Excellent video quality day, good night, good shadow, lackluster park mode. You can hardwire this to hide wires, but most hardwire to an outlet that is only powered when the ignition is on.

I would say Excellent Park mode worth it, dual cam worth it, wifi worth it, GPS worth it, and being discreet is definately worth it.
