That I handled a work situation like a "ninja Grace Kelly".  Still makes me smile 5-6 years later.
INFOWARS.COM BITCH!!
And like the 70's it seems like the west indies, being champion players in t20 have led the way. We need only look at the surfeit of injuries during the IPL and just before it, Michael Holding was right, there is too much cricket, boards need to stop treating players like machines.
Bayley coming out to silence was rather disheartening. But they killed the crowd big time with that third hour as a whole.
Lost.
It is likely based off market research. My question is how old is the data?
To a certain extent, yeah. Knowing you're good (read: not good at all but getting consistently better.) at /something/ is just nice, even if it's not widely appreciated.
This crowd lame as shit

Yes, however, Overload does nothing other than stun, whoch it does fine at rank 1. I'm fully aware of how awful assault turret is, but Overload is worse.

Not sure which is a worse call: misusing an ADA placard or thinking this corner of Reddit is the place to get reliable legal advice.
without published pricelist, he can set out different price to different customeer. 

Now that's a problem IMO
Anyone who'd shoot a spiders with a gun shouldn't have a gun.

I suggest to shoot the spiders with a Canon EOS 7D Mark II [Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_7D_Mark_II) with a Zeiss Otus 55mm f 1.4 prime [lens](http://www.cameraegg.org/best-lenses-for-canon-eos-7d-mark-ii/).

what he means is that, the only way to reliable protect your team from enemy cv is playing balanced or strike, since you can either outskill him with your fighters and help your team doing dmg or just sniping the enemy cv with strike/outdmg the enemy cv
or just not play cv at all lol

I tried Casefile and I have to agree. I don't know if it's the voice or the audio quality.

That is the islam requirement.
I'm not trying to propose a playoff. I'm just throwing out there what I think an FCS-style playoff would look like, with similar guidelines for selection. I don't why that's so hard to understand. Thanks for understand though.
Looks like one of the Feed kits
look up pics of real psilocybe shrooms to see how yours look like. if the pics match up you should be good. 5g is a strong trip if the shrooms are potent, expect ego death
No, I took my preferred one to my school's prom. So yay for that!
&gt; * I'm responding right...
&gt; Where did I say that you must agree with my view point?

You said their would be nothing to discuss with me...I guess you can call that a response.

&gt; * so obviously you're only sticking to a textbook definition and refusing to put yourself in another persons shoes.

What does this even mean...

Are you saying their is an "alternative fact or definition" for the term racism?

And what does my ability or inability to empathize with others have to do with the definition of racism?

&gt; * You are the one who is not open to conversation

And yet here I am in this thread discussing it with people

&gt; * Oh look white people are stupid for not knowing how racist every little thing is." Do you want to understand or do you want to belittle? The choice is yours.

Do you consider any of your posts here you actually entering a discussion on the topic?
I make a point of hitting perfect if they're spamming. Then I spam the laughing emoji at them. Doesn't bother me that they're spamming other than it's poor sportsmanship (in a video game...? ugh).
As an agnostic ex-Muslim, I'd have to kindly agree with Richard Dawkins right here.

16 team PPR with small lineups (1QB / 1RB / 2WR / 1TE / 1Flex)

I give: Sterling Shepard

I get: Ameer Abdullah

RBs - **Howard**, James White

WRs - **Evans, Jordy, Diggs**, Shepard, Kevin White

I'm a bit worried about having White as my only other option at WR, but I could use the help at RB.
Oh yeah I agree. I've seen Marines point out they're not soldiers but nothing serious.
bit of a common one, but Fate Bringer
How much did ShariaBlue pay you for that?
The odd thing about it is that it only happens in this one area as far as I know. I wish there were something like that for the dumb hallway back at the beginning.

Granted, I do love the reaction that dumb hallway gets out of people the first time through.
Hey April fucked me over too and left me down in the dumps. On April 1st, I made a stupid mistake and i've been down in the dumps ever since
No. It just looks like you are still disillusioned by the charms of a con man. (Don't argue dude. Guy is paid for by big money. Its the ethics behind what fuels him that defines him - not the fabricated narrative around him.)

Something like this would be better:

* 7th/8th - $35k

* 9th-12th - $20k

* 13th-16th - $10k

Such a fun series! I love the unicorn.
You just said two different things...

From what I've read, I believe EU4 has extremely limited multithreaded support. Because the vast majority of the workload is run on one core, it will undoubtedly run better on a system specialized in individual core strength. I'm also fairly sure that multithreaded support for Clausewitz is like = 99% 1 core, 0.5% core 2, 0.5% core 3 or similar.

Not true multithread support.

But 67% lugia is minimum IVs while 67% tyranitar isn't (albeit probably being from a raid anyway).

Yes!! He was actually a mailman who went to that forest preserve during his break to take a walk.  It was just a small preserve in the suburbs of Chicago.

Some people did yes. And that skin is A REWARD for spending 8K gems on the game and supporting them. Why should others get it for much cheaper?
What about electrum?
Not in California, though, it's one of very few states that are neither right-to-work nor fully at-will.

They've been taking vids down for a while now, it wasn't strictly legal, but they have a big channel so YT was okay with it. Now they are trying to trademark React, their signature video style, so they can legally do it.
Same here. Hopefully it resolves soon

I-I don't know if I am doing any good. But we won the last challenge.
I love the Christmas one where Steve kills Santa and then Santa comes to kill the Smiths.
Thank you, still learning reddit. Edited for posterity.
we are closer to 2020 than 2010
I dont think Arizona deserved to have him wearing their jersey after trading him like that, and neither did Montreal by trading for the All Star and sending him straight to Newfoundland. 

I think he asked if he could wear the Ice Caps' but thats a definitive no go; just wouldn't make sense to wear an AHL jersey to an NHL event.

At the end of the day, he represented the fans and himself because no team really deserved to have him represent them. 

I particularly like the snub the NHL did to Arizona by picking up James Neal instead of a Coyote as the last alternate (for Toews). True, not the same division, but they could have worked something out for the sake of representation.
Thought this was Trisha Hershberger for a second. I guess I can roll with that thought.
Pretty much

Just dopamine and serotonin here.
It's rough when 1 person can ruin a game.  I was a win away from rank 9 before a 9 game skid.  Top of the scoreboard most every time... Capping in a DD.  Sinking ships.  MM decided to be cruel.  Most rounds I had Yorcks on my team.  I pretty much know how the rounds going to go when I have two Yorcks to the other teams two Atagos or Myokos.  I don't have the time to get to 1, so I'll use ranked to farm ship XP and not get frustrated.  

Wait for team play.  That's what will fix this.
I have accepted that my best friend is a podcast
Shit nice catch! Gotta stop redditing while dabbed out lol 

But it's just weird how he replied to my first one within like 30 mins and then didn't answer my other one. Maybe I'm overthinking it idk.

They just may have broke the hardy's though, could be an amazing feud.
You're obviously not following this or other threads. There were people claiming that Californians were loving to Seattle and influencing local politics. That's who I was responding too, somehow you jumped in. Read before you respond hombre.

Just leaving this here to satisfy your scientific needs.
I'm on my fourth surface in a month. Two had the black screen of death issue, the other two kept dropping the wireless display. This is a new Surface, new pen, and new tip. The previous Surface did this a couple of times too but I wasn't able to reproduce the pen issue in store. This time I took a video!
Damn, sorry to hear that. That's right after I left Halong Bay. Did this happen up there, possibly on the Castaway Tour? Or was is down south on Phu Quoc?

Oh shit
If you don't tap against the warrior you're going to just get grinded out, you do have to interact them to keep up with them, and your cards aren't super efficient at answering the threats they're presenting as you have lower overall card quality by having a diluted deck

Having 60 health doesn't help in fatigue since your warrior opponent, even if starting at like 45 health, or 30 health is going to have 4 more health every turn than you just by pressing Tank up, and that will amount for more healing than more or less the entirety of your deck including Reno.

This is not a fork. This was an actual attack on the coin which was about to dangle the potential value of BCH in front of users which would have put them at extreme risk of funds loss in the parent chain.

The mining company hashing this has stated they would steal funds, and attack via hashrate the parent chain. The developers include an unapologetic copyright thief.

It's a fucking attack, you idiot.

Lying to yourself is harmful.
All I know about that series is Ikumi Mito and that she's all about meat.

And frankly, that's all I need to know.
"well, usually I like mine with onions, mayo and pickles." She said. "That sound alright with you, hon?" She asked

In the 7th ed. Grey knights codex it lists a set of psychic powers that they have for default by just about every unit. Must they always use this loadout or is it just to give a bit of consistency if you dont want to roll on powers. And if you can choose other ones, can grey knights units excluding the libby only use sanctic?
Weird. I wouldn't really include it, but at the end of the day. I don't care. Whatever gets their socks off.
Nah GameFAQs looks like it's from 1998 (with some archaic AF rules to boot), Reddit looks at least ten years newer. 

…You *are* using Reddit /r/Enhancement Suite with it… aren't you?
People did the same for the 290. So we just need a rebrand of the initial Vega to calm people down.

I agree with all this. It was the same for me. My LL partner wasn't actually low libido. That's why we were able to rekindle the sex.
Would you give him the number 8 shirt though? 

A lot of weight on the number you know. The previous chap who wore it was a stud.
This. Stanford might have won a couple national championships with Luck if they had a threat at wideout. Baldwin is more of a standout as a pro than he was in college.
Hooray!! But for real, we need like a giant international troll mixer.

Since asians earn more than white people will you be demanding they accept their asian privilege? 
Jews also on average earn more than white people clearly asians and jews need to check their privilege...
Working as a package handler, which is essentially a free gym membership for cardio alone. I'm wondering if this will interfere with any muscle mass that I'll be gaining. I do hit my macros pretty easily, so I hope I'm fine.
[Gott Mit Uns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIlQLWTLGZk) is probably my favorite off that album
Coming online right now.
Utilitarian is one form of being principled. 

Being principled just means sticking to your beliefs, but doesn't say what those beliefs are.

So you'd have to define a second set of beliefs to compare it to. Believing in adherance to a religious text? Believing in always defending the weaker person. Belief in doing what it best for you and being okay when others do the same.
That if I ate the crust off my sandwiches I would grow wings.
There will be one for the next major competition, so don't worry about that!
Is there anything else in my binder that interests you, or would you be open to trading the Slayer and origin for Shiranui and Divine Wrath?

No one knows
is this the last match ?
Not even close. First you'd have to provide good reason to think god even exists.

Thank you very much for your reply. 
If it's indeed related to alternator, is it typically worn/damaged bearing in alternator pulley (so to replace pulley), or alternator itself? I changed alternator probably 5 years ago (20k miles ago). 

Is there troubleshooting steps to rule out other possibility: bad belt, bad bearing pulley (power steering pump, A/C, idler pulley, tensioner pulley)

Once again, Thank you very much!
Lol...mine is also R1 (and, oddly enough, is missing the exact same number of shards for next rank) but overall in a far worse shape :P
Wow thanks you saved my life.
Yes, easier to handle.
How much time did you spend on r/place?

I'm sure he did. I don't think Isaac Newton himself would feel comfortable enough with his physics calculations to jump in a pool and fire a bullet at himself. I'm sure that this guy fired the bullet under water a few times and if he didn't, props to him. I also agree that this is something genuinely enjoyable by anyone, regardless if you understand the problem solving involved with it. Its just a cool experiment regardless your physics or even science backgrounds.

Would you take 20? I've got 5 of them and will just have to get rid of them separately. Or would you sell me only the ones I don't have?
What the fuck
Christianity is the antithesis of Globalism, so that makes sense.

With Globalism, you accept everyone -- no matter how destructive or perverse their ideology or way of life may be.

With Christianity, you accept just one -- Jesus Christ, the perfect atonement for all of humanity's sin and wrongdoing.

You could use Mathf.SmoothDamp (a personal favourite) . Or use x&lt;=y and set x to y if x is greater than y, using this you should do the check directly AFTER setting the angle. Or use rotation=rotation+someconstant*DeltaTime and perform the check i just told you afterwards.
I don't know that the Spec or even the Record are as likely to close down as the Mercury. There were 23 full-time jobs at the Mercury. You can see that many in every direction when you walk into the offices at the Spec or the Record.

I'm not defending TorStar in any way, but when I did some contract work for them, they were very interested in me talking to the circulation folks at the Record and Spectator, but didn't feel like I needed to talk to the Mercury. I think the Merc was a spur at best, and the writing was on the wall even back then.
Yeah probably, but I don't really know what it could stand for.
That's not campiness.
Hey guys.  Some sad news.  
Just got back from an 8 hour day.  Got skunked completely.  No bites, no nothing.  

I was throwing out a couple of different spoons, power bait rigged with a sinker and leader, power ball with a real worm, and got so desperate that I tried a normal bobber and worm combo to try to catch anything lol.  

I was fishing near an island, tried a couple of random other spots, tried hitting the shore line, everything.  I don't know what I was doing wrong but I definitely was in skunk city.  :(
This is so me. I know the common perception of people who are bad with names is that they're arrogant and just don't care enough to learn the name, but for me it's crippling fear that I will be wrong. My brain freezes up. This especially happens to me when I'm not expecting to see someone.
Holy shit.

Remindme! 1 day. Please let this be real.
These are people who spent $100,000 on a liberal arts degree from Vassar. Crying they can't find a job and these loans are so hard to pay. Bernie will fix it! Make someone else pay it!

College. I actually had a really good time. Had a good group of friends. Had some crazy times. Same could be said for law school. Now all I do is work at law firm for most of the day.
Yes. Look at the problems of climate change, drought, war, etc. All of these things are exacerbated by overpopulation. Unfortunately, it seems that only the most educated people are concerned about it. We need to stop incentivizing fertility treatments and people having children that they can't afford to take care of.
The new Kitten seems to currently be unobtainable without cheating.
Thanks I can't believe I didn't see that
I kind of disagree with that. All our previous games at SS have involved our old game style of precision kicking and posession. Our current gamestyle is lots of dwarves applying record breaking forward pressure, which I would think a smaller ground would support. Taking the most damaging midfielder out of the other team would probably make a difference.   

But who knows, it's Richmond.

I did the same thing, I actually jumped a little bit when the pic zoomed allllll the way in to Hazel's face. What an adorable doge! Sorry for your loss OP. :(
I stayed in brickell 16 and then double tree this year, honestly I liked my brickel extended stay more than double tree. The walk was literally the same distance. We also payed $1000 more for double tree(Canadian) and it was not worth it at all. So I'm going back to brickell and I'm super pumped. Metro mover there is a dream and the walk back is great!
lol so did the mooch

As far as shit finishes go, that was pretty good!
See the ["Encoding decoding method of communication"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication) from The Birmingham School, which can be read as a declaration of the end of cultural Marxism as a response to massively centralized media.

To quote Frankfurt School historian, Douglas Kellner:

&gt;"During this period, mass culture and communication were instrumental in generating the modes of thought and behavior appropriate to a highly organized and massified social order. Thus, the Frankfurt school theory of the culture industry articulates a major historical shift to an era in which mass consumption and culture was indispensable to producing a consumer society based on homogeneous needs and desires for mass-produced products and a mass society based on social organization and homogeneity. It is culturally the era of highly controlled network radio and television, insipid top forty pop music, glossy Hollywood films, national magazines, and other mass-produced cultural artifacts"

We no longer live in such a centralized Culture... and at anyrate, Cultural Marxism is the **critique** of mass culture; it is not the cause of it.
Do you mean you have very generic viewpoints?
Just wanna say thanks again for giving me some advice for that whole situation. Ended up making contact with her mom who was surprisingly calm about some random dude massaging her about her suicidal daughter. But all in all she explained she gets like this some and we both talked to her some and now she's back to being normal and actually seems happy! Feels great to know I helped her

Broken earth is fantastic. I read over 100 books last year, and those two were my favorite. The author uses a second person narration, which is unique and really works... It made me feel a lot closer to (and vested in) the story. The audible narration is top notch too.

After dealing with similar situations while living with my parents I ultimately just had to move...   the best advice I can ever give to anyone is to always stand up for yourself. YOU are your best investment. Living in a place where it hurts mentally and physically isn't worth it... You need to finish your education as well. So if there's even a chance that you can go to school and live either with a roommate or alone for that time I would suggest that.... if you decide to tough it out I would suggest talking FIRMLY with her. State that you won't tolerate abuse. I would so suggest telling her how it makes you feel but I can tell she isn't going to listen. 

Also from experience... living paycheck to paycheck while in school with a full time job is far better than living in a place where you are abused. I wish you all the luck and courage in the world. Inbox me if you ever need advice.
I just recently finished the whole omnibus and it was extremely good! Enjoy!

I really needed this there's been someone I've been into for a while now but it'll never happen and I needed to hear this. Idk if it's my self esteem or what but I'm trying to work on myself and this helps more than you know. For some reason I can't get past being awkward or ever getting past a first date but I'm slowly getting better thank you all I love you so much.
I was looking for something like that, and so confused about why these white bricks were being called handmade tiles that I double checked that I wasn't in /r/SubredditSimulator. Then I finally realized it was plain white tiles that someone massively overpaid for, because Portland.
I won't argue with that.

On the other hand, we might consider the possibility that a 14-year-old Togruta might actually be considered an adult. It might be equivalent to an 18-year-old (or older) human, for example. (I realize there isn't any evidence to support this, I'm just throwing it out there.)

They actually do address real values and decision-making with consequences.

Edit: MLP is cool, but I only see the cartoons my kids put on.
Smart point, but if the violent firm can successfully remove its competitor swiftly, won't the benefit of its monopoly outweigh the intermittent higher costs?
This is my daily struggle for the next few months because we are too understaffed and don't have the money to hire that many more employees (no one is showing up for interviews in general either)

It's a bit of a vicious cycle at the moment. Barely anyone plays because Diameter pubs are basically dead, but Diameter pubs are basically dead because barely anyone plays. 

We really need new players, but even then, the challenge is to keep them around, but with Oceanic activity on what feels like a pretty rapid decline, it might already be too late.
What OS are you using? Honestly, **the** most effective way to increase FPS on a machine like that is to install Linux on the machine. With Linux, you can make a potato contend with a modern low end computer. (I reccommend [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/). I've personally used it on computers 10+ years old and got decent results). If that's not a possibility, then I would recommend that you make sure there are no other non-vital processes running in the background, and perhaps try making the window smaller.
Hi my name is Nathan and I live in north Texas. I just bought a Granny Smith apple tree, and I was wondering how it would handle a trunk cut. I plan to cut it in the winter, leaving about two inches from a bud, any advice would be gladly needed.
I hear that if you soak a towel in milk and apply it to the affected area for a few hours,  it helps alot.  can't speak from experience, though.

The capacitor has two plates than can hold charge. That is, the plate connected to the negative terminal will be able to fill up with electrons, and the other plate will give up electrons to the positive pole of the battery. No current flows between the plates, but current can flow from the battery to the plates along the wires.

When a neutrally charged capacitor is first connected to the battery, it is like connecting a wire between the poles of the battery. The electrons flow as fast as the battery can provide them. In the ideal case, the resistance is 0, the current is infinite, and voltage is undefined. A voltmeter will measure the voltage at the two points as the same, just as if it was a short circuiting wire.

But immediately, the plates become partly charged, which reduces the current flow and increases the voltage reading across the capacitor. In the ideal case, the voltage increases asymptotically to the voltage of the battery. That is, it never quite reaches the battery voltage, and the capacitor never becomes "fully charged." In practice, the current drops to near 0, and the voltage is pretty well the same as the battery.

For a large capacitor, this can take quite a long time, like an hour or so. To speed up the process, you can charge the capacitor with a higher voltage source at first, then hook up the charged capacitor to your battery. Make sure to get the polarity correct! The explosion can be quite dangerous.
It's not terrible, I will say that. But they are ruining it with the presentation of being "live" and ending in the ring, it's just an insult to intelligence.
Mmmmmmmmm you just made me so horny
Since they have said that the Green Lantern Corps movie (as well as the unconfirmed leaked casting call) will feature a veteran 40ish year old Hal, it is highly likely that in the DCEU Abin Sur died some years ago. He could appear in the ancient war segment but that would make him thousands of years old, which is possible but probably unlikely. If anything we will see a GL in that scene but it won't be Abin Sur, and perhaps if Hal is secretly in the film we will have some reference to Abin.
The WRT54GL is super ancient.

Interface speed is independent of CPU routing speed, simply because a router has 100 mbit interfaces doesn't mean it can actually route 100 mbit of traffic.

In this case you'd be looking for a new device.  You could also do a top or htop while you run a speed test and you should see the CPU peg out at or near 100% during those transfers to confirm said bottleneck.

Definitely not the saddest moment in the entire series but it's worth mentioning general tarpals death in tcw he was the only gungan I actively liked in seeing him go down in that badass fight with grevious was sad but a worthy end for him.
Why do you consider them cheap garbage? I loved my 91 vr4. :(
Definitely. I can put a whole 4-tops plates and drinks on a food tray and take it to the kitchen in one fell swoop. Today, I did it with a drink tray (just plates only) and I remember thinking, "this is great! I don't have to balance these plates!" However, I'm not going to go get a tray if I'm already in my section and need to clear plates.
y = 3\*2^(x) (given)

y/3 = 2^(x)

ln*_2_*(y/3) = x (take log base 2 of both sides)

So since we have to take the log of a positive number, y/3 &gt; 0, so y &gt; 0 for the range.

How? I am actually curious.
I need more context. Here in Canada, privitization generally doesn't mean turning over a service to the private sector. It means the government hires a privately owned business to take over a function formerly run directly by the state. The commies love this and generally call it public private partnerships. Ancaps call it corruption, crony capitalism, and rent seeking. It usually ends up worse than the government running it themselves.

If you're a beginner and at 30% bodyfat there is almost no such thing as too few calories (almost, not literally) and you will still build muscle while losing weight easily if at 20% or more defecit.

Use IIFYM.com calculator which takes into account both your job activity, and your workout activity to calculate modified BMR for better accuracy.

I lost 17kg (from whatever I was to around 20% bodyfat) while on 1500 calories (Way more than 20% defecit) while putting on muscle. When My lifts started to stall at the gym is when I increased calories. Now i'm pretty close to goal weight so only on a 15% defecit as that is now what lets me keep building muscle while ( very slowly) losing weight - but it doesn't bother me that much as I look decent at the moment just not quiet at my goal.

not only Greek tragedy, but Wagner's operas too! You'll have your work cut out for you if you want to read that. But I think in a broader sense, Greco-Roman history/culture is one of the things you should have some knowledge of in order to get the most out of Nietzsche, the other two (in my opinion) are Christianity and, of course, philosophy (especially the history of philosophy).

I guess I have noticed that with small venues too. Nothing at Emo's in Austin when Wolfmother performed, or with Primus at the Aztec (which was a fucking awesome show, if I may say so).

At the Wolfmother show though, the audience did start moshing, which I thought was kind of odd considering the music. They played a punk song and they got it out of their system. There was also a guy holding a foam music note in front of me waving it around the entire show. Odd duck but it seemed like he had fun.

&gt; It's one thing to hang out with your SO's friends, because they're cool and all and you all have fun together, but they're not your friends. They're hanging out with you because you're bringing your SO along, and you know that if something happens between you two that they're not really going to take your side.

EXACTLY. They're really nice, but I'm pretty sure they won't comfort me when I'm hurt or something like that. I just want something that's...well, mine.

As I was reading through this thread, I was thinking it would be helpful to have a small note in the menu explaining any local or regional customs a visitor might not know.  Of course, 99% of the time it isn't needed since most patrons are local and already know.  

It can be a challenge not knowing if service for ones table is shared by the staff or only from a specific server, if the check must be requested, or how much it is appropriate to tip.  I have found many guidebooks to lack adequate coverage of this topic, and when there is also a language barrier between the patron and the server, it can be awkward.
I think this is all up in the air, especially considering defeat on healthcare reform. Watch for Congress talking about the budget. I'm sure the initial proposals will change significantly.

I honestly feel this is something very important for people to do for their friends too, not just from their parents

Diesel cook tops suck ass. Don't like altitude and slow to heat up.

Well technically Sombra isn't really Talon since she is working for her own gains, and a hack to Zen in lore could probably shut him down

Thank god, I don't know how you could've afforded one on 24k/ month

11+ *if* you work 7 days a week. So how much do you sleep? Gym time? Any hobbies? How do you manage three plates?

She was capable of generating an aura, this is an ability of the soul according to pyrrha.  
That suggests Penny had a soul, possibly through some weird implant/transfusion to a robot body.  
Whether the soul died or not is entirely up in the air. However I would regard Penny as a person, just a person who's body was entirely cybernetic :P
Well you are a girl, sitting down in a coffee shop, drinking coffee, random dude sits next to you and says, 'Hi there how are you', doesn't the girl go like 'wtf is going on...' ?. About your question, i don't know.

&gt; As cool as some of the r India mods seem

Kek, none of them 

Knowing them, there is no doubt that they play the "main indian sub" card to poach those amas. 

Those suckers are even copying whatever little we do on this sub. They started all those weekly threads and provided them sticky after we had been doing them for a while. One of the randimods even started posting RDD all of a sudden and stickied it when there was none posted from at least half a month. And when we were toying with the casual AMAs with redditors idea on RDDs, boom, they started doing it themselves within a week. 

I have absolutely no doubt they are trying to stop further leakage of non-political crowd to indiaspeaks

Wow! You guys go to a lot of effort. You obviously love it and make it a lifestyle choice.
“It's time to come back to reality, Rose.”

Without opening my eyes I could tell it was Abaddon speaking to me. I was laying face down on the rug, and as warm as it was I had to pull myself together. 

“Is my family dead too?”

“Straight to the point I see, you didn’t seem to care too much about your family when you thought I was some random sexual encounter.”

“How dare you! I may not always show it, or act like it...But I love Jakob, and I love my kids.” 

“That’s why you cheat on him?” 

“It’s...complicated.” 

“It really isn’t, and besides, there’s no point in trying to convince me of anything. I know everything there is to know about you. You aren’t here to prove your innocence, because you aren’t innocent. You’re here because I have a deal for you. A deal that if you truly love your children, you can not refuse.”

 “What kind of deal is it?”

“Well, I should tell you this first, unfortunately your husband died on impact.”

“Oh my God.” 

I fell to my knees and wept, not holding anything back in front of this man who felt nothing relaying heartbreaking news. In fact he hasn’t stopped grinning since the second I opened my eyes. 

“How can you smile through all of this?”

“Oh it's nothing personal, believe me. I have to deal with so many of these stories that I have no room for tears anymore. I was once like you, I'm not actually the devil, well, not the original anyway. There are so many humans on the planet now that the real devil had to start using avatars to process all the damned souls. Heaven and Hell are a lot like the DMV. Actually it's a lot like mall Santa's, but we are all part of the real devil.”

“Who the hell would want a job like this? Who could stomach this awful responsibility.”

“That's actually a nice segue, Rose. You see, while your husband is dead, your two children are not.”

“Oh thank God.”

“First you blame him, now you're thanking him? No matter how many I see, I still can't believe how fickle people are. Yes, your children are alive, but them staying alive really depends on you at this point.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, let's go back to your other question. Who the hell would want a job like this? Right now, you would.”

“Why would I want this job?”

“If you don't take it, your children die. You were the only one who's meant to survive this crash. You also happen to possess every quality needed to be successful in this line of work. So think of it as a fair trade, a down payment for your services if you will. You work for the devil, Randy and Caroline live. It's a win win.”

“What do you mean by that? I am nothing like you. I have a heart.”

“It’s not about morality, and it’s not about right and wrong. It’s about what is, and what must be. You have an exceptional knack for lying. You would have to, to keep the countless affairs from your husband. You also have a lovely face, and a soothing voice. Making people feel comfortable in this kind of situation is a necessity. Most of all, you do truly love your children, and that is what’s going to make you accept this deal.”

“Why don't you let all three of us live? I can work here when I die naturally. That way everyone wins.”

He frowned, and then walked over to me and placed a hand on my cheek. 

“I'm afraid I don't win in that situation. As I’ve said, I was once like you. I was offered this deal, and now I'm working it off. For every soul I recruit to work here I get a year off of my sentence. FYI, if you save your kids, you get the remainder of the kids lifetimes as a sentence. And before you ask, yes, all deaths are predetermined.” 

“How long have you been doing this? And what happens after I fulfill my sentence?”

“I've been working longer than I can remember, and I can't answer the second question just yet. For now sit down and eat, contemplate this tough choice.”

“There's really nothing to think about.”

I brushed his hand away from my face and limped over to the table. 

“I have nothing to think about because my answer is obvious. My kids need to live. No matter what I have to do, I want my children to live.”

“So you're saying that no matter how long you have to work here, you'll sacrifice yourself for your children?”

“Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Just let Randy and Caroline live, please.” 

A broad smile spread across his face as he walked over and stood next to me.

“Wonderful Rose, but I'm sure you'll come to regret this decision. God knows I have.”

He snapped his fingers and a plain wooden door appeared behind him. It slowly creaked open and in walked an extremely small creature. Creature is the only accurate word to describe this knee high little devil. It’s skin was bright red, and it had the face of a goat, with large horns sprouting from the sides of its head. It flashed its jagged little teeth at me and I nearly threw up. The little creature was carrying a silver platter above it’s head, that had to be bigger than the creature itself. 

“Ah, thank you, Lump.”

Abaddon reached down and pulled the lid off the platter, revealing a contract written in beautifully flowing cursive, and an old style pen with some ink. He dipped the pen in the ink and handed it to me. 

“Just sign here at the bottom.”

I took the pen from him and quickly signed my name. 

“The living should really read these contracts before signing them. Oh well, at least I don't have to deal with another lawyer. “
Fair, it just kinda came back to me with how Redditors have been mocking the FineBros guy about his eyes. I disagree with what they did and think mocking them is fine, but keep it to mocking their awful trademarking move versus things they can't control

Beat him until the trauma is both physically and mentally noticeable. Then shelter him from the outside world, condition him to not make any decisions for himself, and punish any independent thought until he becomes an adult and is incapable of functioning in society then laugh at him and call him a fucking loser then blame the outcome of his life on him even though it wasnt really his fault until he start to crumble under the false guilt and works a dead-end job living off cup noodles and paying for your gambling addiction.

Thank you for pointing out these flaws. Unregulated capitalism (imagine no government to regulate it at all, so anarchy) will always lead to monopoly eventually, it is the natural state of it.

Only through regulations can capitalism be anything different. The middle class is an anomaly within capitalism, since it is created through regulation, otherwise it would be just a tiny sliver of working professionals (lawyers and doctors maybe, just the people who make a ton of money but don't come from old money).

I don't know why someone would vote against their own interests other than by ignorance or irrationality, which are both abounding in the age of the 24/7 news cycle, unfortunately.

First off, you can't even check what division im in. Like no site allows you. Second off Im Gold 2 right now. But if you're really thirsty you can go way back before the reset and see that I was playing with almost exclusively high plat/low diamond people. I still am. If I was low plat I'd be playing with people who were gold last season. But I'm not. I'm literally only playing with high plats and low diamond.


&gt;What. Fucking. Vacuum.

&gt;What is math to you? Just a nuisance? A fairy tale? Here, why don't you take the chalk and do the math and prove your point. Oh wait. You can't.


applying math in a vacuum is when you dont apply basic logic to numbers. if you have 20 balloons and you want each person to have 3 balloons, you cant invite 6.66666667 people to your party, no you invite 6, because you can't get .6 of a person. Ignoring this is applying math in a vacuum. You're not adhering to logic.

Both statements could be true, they are not stating the same thing. The first statement appears to refer to a host's overall rating, and the second may be referring to all the star ratings a host gets on all subcategories such as location, cleanliness, etc. There may also be quirks in how Airbnb calculates overall host ratings, such as generous rounding up.

Any system requires some degree of force to keep itself working. Socialism is the worker's control of the means of production, so the punishment system will be a voted, democratic one. Leftist ideology will have punishment if needed, but the aim of the ideology is always to remove the existence of dissenters by having lots of harmony and a content populace, thus removing the need for force, punishment and vigilance. Much like how in a good family house, there aren't cameras or police to guard the refrigerator. People simply organize by talking and trusting each other.

Blur wasn't being biased. First off, he's a massive s2j fan, they're both from socal, etc. He was just trying to hype the match up and make it seem like something more was on the line than just a placing. With Blur's statement, for the less knowledgeable viewers at home, the outcome of this match could possibly move Wizzrobe one notch closer towards being considered the best falcon. It adds hype. He was just being a good commentator by exaggerating a little.

As a person who's dealt with it for the last year, I still don't know how to correctly. I'd love to take drugs every night because they do the trick, but I don't want to get addicted and depend on them.

I've tried reading a book, melatonin, all that shit, just end up cleaning the house or some dumb shit at night.
Sjovt som den slags historier er cool og progressive når det er en kvinde og to mænd, men hvis det var en mand der valgte at supplere sin aldrende kone med en yngre model han installerede i kælderen, så ville minen nok have været helt anderledes stram.
I upvoted anyway, it'll be interesting to see if the gestapo visits me
The biggest enjoyment for me was the Socializing, I LOVED to talk to pretty much anyone and be friends. I loved all the customization options with the house builder and the variety of objects to decorate. Also lots of really nice people on their(not all) that we all came together had RP sessions and races, clothe color game. The clothing was another great aspect of Free Realms. Lots of options for the color, style, and different achievements to earn them too. Then the mounts, loved most of them except the spaceship one, everyone spammed and made those red/orange streaks all of the screen. Other than that I spent everything I had to get all the mounts/outfits and TCG cards. I owe a lot of joy and happiness to this game and it's developers. I can't wait to be reconnected with all the Nostalgia!

It's not the people that simply prefer Melee that are the problem. It's the people that think it's the perfect end-all-be-all game, and say that anyone who prefers Brawl or SSB4 is stupid that are the problem.

I like Melee. It was the first Nintendo game I was ever introduced to. It holds a special place in my heart. But I'm not going to delude myself into thinking that it's flawless, or that Brawl and SSB4 didn't do many things better.
Good for you on calling out the truth. Asian's and especially mainland chinese are more dangerous than many of the other minorities. 

They come into the west with cash, drive the fuck up out of property values in one area, then use that base to push Asians into politics which allow the shit to spread to neighboring areas. 

They then get into jobs where they hire and promote mostly Asians or the occasional minority feminine male to throw off discrimination claims. 

All the while they love socialism and marxism and best of all, they hate and discriminate against the native population. All the while they're quite about it and few people are willing to speak up. 80% of Asian women in the US voted for Hilary. Bam.
I hate that. Didn't no we could change our preferences.
Personally, I use the Requiem Cereplate.  It allows you to overflow a certain amount of essence, and tends to keep me fairly full.  The gear is representative of fairly intense (but casual) farming, but [here's the d3planner for a general idea](https://www.d3planner.com/157336297).

There are various approaches to it, most of them require one or two pieces of gear.  Notably I also use Shadowhook (cubed) to generate additional essence.
You have the exact same arguments we hear all day defending Klab. Seriously, read any **well-made** post about why this anniversary is not OK. I'm pretty sure we're all tired explaining it over and over again.

We're not entitled to get anything,  but they don't want us, walking wallets, to leave either, it works both ways. They did a great job on attracting new people to the game, while doing a terrible job at keeping old ones playing. We'll see how it works out for them in the future. 

Now please, if you have anything NEW to bring to the table of arguments, I'll be glad to hear it.

Thank you! :)  I like to include detail sometimes. I thought this would be a perfect time to do just that lmao!
Supposedly illegal on the NA server, according to the OM Mod Pack installer.
TV news crews do this all the time where I am.

The knife I caught was only 6 stitches I guess I got lucky
That was a gnarly barehand
Great article.
In the movie they modernized the setting in weird ways (there's a mall with an escalator, for instance), added stupid sidekicks that weren't in the book, made Ella way more damsel-y, downplayed both her intelligence and her friendship with Char, made Mandy young and hot (which she wasn't in the book and that's why Ella was surprised to learn that she was a fairy), and made the magic book into Mandy's boyfriend who she turned into a book by sucking at magic. Just all different kinds of campy and stupid and shitty.
You can get an aftermarket 1080 for $450 on any decent sale. 

$450 for 1070*ish* performance is a terrible deal.
Oh, well it's not the kind of long story that's interesting, it's the kind of long story that's kinda complicated! Haha. I'll try to keep it short and not bore you. x)

I only took myself, a friend, and a car-full of stuff to NC. I left everything behind and my dad didn't pick up the stuff from my mom's house in time and she ended up being the reason a lot of things went missing. She eventually lost the house, and with it whatever random stuff I left behind that my dad couldn't salvage for me to bring to me later. It sucks, because every now and again a memory will pop up and I'll realize another item of mine never made it to NC to me. There was a lot of silly things that were materialistic such as blankets, clothes, my stereo, etc. But there was a lot of memories, too. I had a poster tube full of things I drew and things people gave me, like an art print my favorite art teacher gave me. Gone. I've learned to get over it.

I forgave my mom because even though I lost some stuff, she lost everything. Repeatedly. She's an on-again, off-again addict. At this point, 2016, she probably has a handful of items to her name from her entire life. Anyways, sorry to get all dark about puzzles!! Hahaa. But that's where they went, probably in some estate sale after my mom let the house go.
2.5 years old. Had him try Rec Room. I left him with the HMD strapped to his face while I went to get more beer from the store. He seemed OK when I got back so I figure he liked it.
That's just politics in a nutshell. The GOP has it down. Distract them with what's in this hand while fucking them with what's in the other hand.
Neville is a god damn genius.
Yeah, I'm familiar with when they came out. I just sorta consider there to be a line between ToS and ToD just because he was able to have much higher production value. I'll check out Monomania though!

I buy a lot of cheese, sometimes mixed nuts, jerky, small yogurts. I know what I crave, and it's salt and fat. Sometimes also carrots with dip (cream cheese, or an artichoke/parmesan dip - the Smith's I go to and a few others I've seen have one with INSANELY low carbs if you're looking for that), easily-grabbable fruits like grapes, berries. I'll admit, that for the sake of limiting myself and not being a monster, I do pre-portioned or I portion them myself (string cheese and babybel cheeses are my friend, here), which I understand is wasteful, but it makes me think twice about walking back to the other side of the office to the fridge to get more.
You've gone deeper than most
Yeah...super weird about people wanting to see attractive women naked...who would've thought?
The families I've seen going down this path usually started off with a parent who came into a whole lot of wealth in a high-stress job. Whatever they did to earn the money makes them obviously unhappy, so their kids get obsessed with abstracts like "self-actualization," decide that they don't want a career, and end up kind of bored and aimless because they're never really been challenged or pushed out of their comfort zone.

I also know plenty of wealthy families who expected their kids to work for a living and put limits on the ways they planned to provide for them (although they still gave them lots of help with things like graduating college debt-free), and those kids turned out way happier and more successful. It sounds like you're in this second category and don't have to worry too much.
99% it's the tv. Look for a game mode in the settings. If there is no game mode or setting such as that then your tv just has hella input lag.
Well there's me, the master programmer...

Sadly the left one is the current Germany, after they've been enriched by the Islamic truck of peace.
"Shoots fired" Okay.
The quote in question:

&gt;Statement from Donald J. Trump:
I don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech. Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:
“When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you (pointing to the audience). They’re not sending you (pointing again). They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us. They’re bringing drugs.They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people! But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast.”

How exactly do they "pick and choose" who to send, and why? What is the Mexican government's motivation? That just seems like hogwash; the majority of people coming are people looking to get away from the crap that is said government. I thought the rhetoric was they come to take up our low-paying blue collar jobs. Or has that changed now?

Exactly, nobody is going to wait 3 hours on youtube for ice to go live like he was on this video.
The snow, can be done with the 2 inch brush as well as the knife.
I'd keep it dude. Once the event ends, his price will rise and who knows what they have planned for earned event rewards. 

The fact they released mediocre ones tells me that they have some sort of plan. Unless they are really trolling us.
Buying KA10 will also give you two trait rolls for Sora EX. The average player will never get an EX medal apart from Sora EX so I don't think that should factor into most people's considerations...
u dont need to rebuild. sign cp3 and blake and hire a gm that can actually find underrated talent.
Does the shield bash needs to deal damage for the target to be knocked down, or is the hit and then the success on the strong-strong test enough?
I was in the same boat as you I had to email Debra Frazier she's the advisor for Hispanic studies her email is dfrazier@central.uh.edu
Yonge and finch? Is that one of the best places to go for tons of gyms/raids?
Conversely spending the dust by combining it into a single UTXO reduces the size of the UTXO set which must be kept in memory by all full nodes. It's good to eliminate dust, especially if it's affordable...

Yes that part always felt surreal to me.
Another vote for Planet Fitness. If there is one near your apartment they tend to be cheap and practical.
Enjoy!! Pokemon is the best.
Just 3 Brillant Fusions. I ordered a serahpinite weeks ago that never showed up. I can do a great deal on them since no serahpinite.
Based on what I've heard, this is the app that you want: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.myklos.btautoconnect

I'm not exactly sure what you need to do within the app to fix the input lag though.
Everytime i went to the dentist i got a tooth pulled. Growing up my adult teeth started growing faster than my babyteeth would fall out, so i ended up having to get a vast majority of them pulled. So all my dentist experiences were the worst.
Stuff my wife cooks.
Rudy. The scene when all his teammates band together to make sure Rudy has a chance to play in the final game. The first time, I choked up and nodded respectfully for the behavior of the star players... Then it panned out to show the whole goddammed team in the hallway, each of them with their jersey in hand. I cried quietly, tears down my face in the theater. He worked so hard. 

I openly cry now every time. I don't give a shit what others think.
I like him better this season than I did last season.
Yes he sure did.
It's a reference to another askreddit post comment. The topic was what was the hardest "would you rather" question you know. You can figure it out from there I suppose.

Please stop.  You have no idea what you're talking about.  You are far out of your depth.
Oh, there's a time limit on commenting? Sorry, I didn't get the memo. I actually had a very busy weekend and didn't get to spend as much time on Reddit as usual. Thanks for putting me in my place, I swear it will never happen again.

In case you weren't sure, /s.
I don't particularly like Seth Rollins or Dean Ambroses' theme songs.
It's all good. I honestly quickly read the title..

Thompson cannot guard Melo. Feed him!!!!!
Guys have a similar one, which I guess could extend to girls too. But being relatively unattractive and undesirable with women makes it super easy to spot when they're trying to manipulate you. It's almost like a super power.  

edit: those aren't really similar, should have said it made me think of that. oh well
Hey, I'm a little confused about the difference between the NA or the EU card choices.

Were the differences tech choices for the meta? or were they mainly based on card availability?

Thanks for the deck! Super fun!

I once had a lady use the word "castrate" in an interview. She was referring to humans. 

No, we didn't hire her.

If sites like Breitbart are any indication, they hated her from the start, but saw it as pandering to us disgusting reprobates. 

Honestly, I'm not sure who's on Jenner's side right now. The trans community sure as hell isn't.
You must be new to GW. Redoing their lines is what they do. At our expense.
I mean, not right away it was like 500 or 1k I think? And a year or so ago I asked to get the limit raised and somehow they came back with a 12k limit which is where I am now. It's with a credit union but I'm not sure if that makes any difference.

I think Civil War reenactments are a very different thing than waving Confederate flags in the streets of an American city. Remembering and reenacting the devastation of the war might help these racist battle-flag wavers understand what their flag really stands for.
They're just glorified belt sanders.
Love you anyways

What a beautiful look!  Beeper is a really ugly brown on me.
Original OST is way to go.
*smiles a bit*

I'm chill, I don't expect you to change...And it's not just about what you say...Yeah, the flirting is annoying, but I can't think of an occasion that you've actually meant harm to me...Nah, it's the other stuff that bothers me...I mean, shooting Font, arguably the lest threatening person here, going and whining to Dan about the Walmsley thing?...That's just sad...
Yeah.... RIP paint.
Except one paragraph in and he seems to be confused, unless I am. Affection and passion are certainly descriptive of the character of God's love and even motivation. I would recommend "God's Spreading Goodness" by RN Frost

You're not alone, my first thought after reading the first few lines, then the contact name was "Hot stud muffin? That's a pretty gross nickname for your Dad...wait a minute."
* What is the output from the generator? AC? DC?
* What is the maximum voltage?
* What is the voltage at the maximum power point of the generator? (depends a bit on the person riding the bike)

You should use a charge controller to charge the battery. A person on a bike will take a very very long time to charge a decent size marine battery, so overcharging is probably not an issue, this is just a much easier way to approach the problem.

You mention delivering a constant current to charge the battery. The constant current phase of charging a lead acid battery is a current ceiling to prevent the voltage across the battery from going above (approx) 14.4V (the battery will start to generate gas). You don't need the current to be constant, the battery will still charge fine if it is varying. The charge controller will limit the voltage across the battery when the charging reaches the constant voltage phase, this is where the charge controller is more important.

Don't worry about 'rapid changes in current', no changes in current or voltage from a person pedaling on a bike would be considered rapid in the electronics world.

I would recommend using a generator with a DC output.
If you knew the output voltage of the generator while at a comfortable riding pace, then I would look for a MPPT charge controller with a manual setting for the MPP. Set the MPP voltage to the generators output voltage at your comfortable riding speed. This will make charging the battery easier for the person doing the pedaling.

So I should dismiss them and get new ones?

I should add that I've played this game many times before on PS3, but am now getting back into it on PC.   I don't remember mage pawns being this useless.
I love Metamucil &lt;3 I buy them in capsule form, which you could always take with an unblended banana and a few big glasses of ice water :)

Some people defend themselves differently. If someone is trying to kill, some may respond with lethal force, others may retreat.

look i'm not gonna say we have a great team but I'm pretty sure you don't need a 300M squad to beat fucking Empoli and Crotone so even though our team needs some upgrades it isn't as simple

I'd probably be considered a weak 37 because I tend to power up more "fun" Pokemon rather than gym sitters/attackers.  That said:

I don't do gyms much; I generally get 2-5 coins/day (well today, 6) and that's enough for me.  I live in a HIGHLY contested area and the aggravation of battling spoofers/botters/multi-accounters just isn't worth it to me.

Mad Max: Furry Road

Same plot, just furrier.
Except they are printing a bunch of double sided tokens in each box?

I don't understand why people are always so caught up on this whole "separate print run" thing.

FANTASTIC.
But "could've" means "could have" so the phrase "could've been" is really "could have been". It just sounds like the word of but that's not what it is.

Lol. There used to be a hog rider deck with cannon where the ice wizard was a better option .
I couldn't find exactly what I wanted, and wasn't too keen on sharing the info with a 3rd party. So I wrote my own in Tasker that uploads data to Google Spreadsheets. I primarily just track bm's (count, Bristol rating, symptoms such as cramping), but have it set up for weight as well. It started as an effort to digitize a food journal and BM tracker and kind of grew from there.
I came on to say the same thing.  Streamers don't have to try that hard to avoid this stuff, sure accidents/trolls happen, but when it happens this much?  Dude is either a straight up dumb racist, or worse, he isn't but thinks that these racist 'slipups' are a good way to generate traffic.
Oh really even in the case?
My uncle puts the emphasis of photography on the first syllable so it comes out as PHOtography.

A friend of mine pronounces controversy as conTROversy... Pretty sure if that one is just to be annoying, though
Or maybe on the flip side, leaving the health amounts of both Mech and baby DVa alone, and slowing down Call Mech charge a little bit?

I can't even begin to assess the deeper ramifications of such a change, beyond the obvious: it'll make the loss of Mech more punishing for DVa's team, and it'll mean more to get the enemy DVa out of her Mech.
So if there's ever a balance change needed to "nerf" her, this would be a decent one, maybe?

Edit: Though this may be encouraging baby DVa suicides :(
A bot. That's Marvin, the "paranoid android" from the Hitchhiker's Guide. If you type a number the bot attempts to link it to a skip.

So if you type say, 689 please Marvin he should reply with a link to that skip.
You know that traditionally 6.5% on an auto loan would be considered very low.  It's only in the past 10-15 years that we have become so accustomed to such low interest loans.  Hell, through a good portion of the 70's and 80's that would be a rock bottom rate for a mortgage.

When you said high interest rate I figured you meant 19% like some of these "Buy here pay here" places pull on people.  Wait your six months and refinance.  Your locked in it by the sounds of it.
Thanks for the feedback and input! Yeah, I can see where you're coming from on that, although, now that you mention it, I forgot I have a couple future/deep house tracks I'm also working on. The biggest thing is I want to have one signature sound/style, so if I have a couple I was thinking multiple aliases would be in order.
I'm a fan of those wheels. They look great on the car!

I would agree with that last statement about the hope if it weren't for the fact that he didn't play during the second session when everybody else did. That is kinda the nail in the coffin as far as his status in the game goes. 
EDIT: there still is the possibility of steam bugging out, let's just hope that that is the case.
BURN IT DOWN
I think Bayley should have also worn her Ironman attire so Alexa could yell at her about it.
Not fully sure who to bring. I think Vanille with USB is one...wanted to go Agrias with BSB/Gaia's Cross/Guardbringer for the second, but might not be the smartest. Ramza Shout/OK BSB are always good options. Raines BSB can still hit everything. Gilgamesh BSB won't work, it's all NAT except for the counters, but that still could at least removes the annoyance of the counters. Gordon Goddess Bell would be good, extra mitigation. Maria BSB to burst them down. I've got options, it's just a question of which one is best.

Can confirm. I've spent a fair bit of time driving in central and northern New Jersey. People there drive hard and fast and rarely have any common courtesies like signals. At least they drive with purpose though.
A banker does not provide labor.  They create wealth.  Investment banking is a zero sum gain where labor isn't.  You're comparing apples and oranges.

I want to apologize to the 5-10 people who visited before all this started... these assholes are literally paralyzing my brain with their bigotry and racism, and it's really hard to ignore when every post ends with /u/tragicsociety.

Tea is a natural source of fluoride and is a protective factor for teeth, as long as there is no sugar added. The only potential downside is stain with frequent consumption, which is purely a cosmetic consideration.

I'm a furry - I've been going to furry cons for seven years and I have a partial (as in just head, arms/hands, and tail) fursuit. Talking about this shouldn't be any different than saying I like to go to sci-fi/fantasy cons and cosplay. I like art, costuming, and performance; I like to get together with friendly people who like the same stuff and party. I'll readily tell people about my involvement with other aspects of nerd culture, but I keep the furry stuff under wraps in general since nine out of ten people will interpret that to mean a.) I go to conventions specifically to fuck people in an animal costume, b.) I identify as an animal, c.) I want to fuck actual animals, or d.) all of the above.
29-31% viability sounds more right to me for five month-old yeast than 0% or 10%, based on my past experience with fermentation using 5-6 month old yeast with a single-stage starter.

&gt;From one of the Wikileaks. Scroll down to see Soros paid pope 650k 

This document describes us$650k used to fund two groups, PICO and the Center of Faith in Public Life, neither of which appear to be associated with Pope Francis. The Pope connection seems to revolve around his visit in 2015 and financing the groups to allow them to take advantage of that publicity to further their goals. 

I see Jonathan Soros' name a bunch, but George only mentioned once. I presume they are related?

What exactly are we looking at here and how did you take from it that Pope Francis received any money?
You are not alone!

Actually, there was a National Geographic episode (or Discovery Channel) where they disproved that.  They now believe that the people stood up there statues and with ropes walked them (waddled them back and forth) to the shore.  Decedents indicate from their stories passed down from generation to generation that they "walked" there.

I have stopped pulling after spending 37.2k crystals, and so far, only 1 set of 6\* Iron Fist from the East. So, this gentleman's statistics are quite close to my experience....1 out of 31 pulls, 1 set of 6-star for me.  And this is the number after Season 2 started.  Zero 6-star pieces in Season 1 from pulling or ToD. All my 6-star pieces in Season 1 were from Alchemy....
I don't remember any of this. I'll have to go through it all over again to refresh.

Thanks for answering!
You kinda just realize that they've got some good points, practices, and ideas.
I'm talking about incredible gems. They have nothing to do with DS.
I was waiting tables and a woman with her family asked for a side of mai-neece with her burger. Sensing my obvious confusion, her family translated it to mayonnaise. I think they'd been through it with her before.

I had done drugs and committed crime all my life. I had just been arrested on drug charges. I was 18 years old. The United States was now run by a brutal dictator who oppressed poor citizens such as myself.  I had the choice of going to prison for a long time or fighting to the death against four other criminals. I didn't want to go to prison at all. If I won the fight I would go free, so I figured I would take my chances. I'm 6'2 and 225 pounds of muscle so I thougt I could win.

We got to the room it was about 1000 feet by 1000 feet. It had a one way mirror where the elite family would watch from. The guards brought me in room. I was given a large kitchen blade. One by one four other men entered the room. They all had blades and they where all huge and muscular. "Shit what have I gotten myself into" I whispered to myself. 

DING. The bell rang and the fight had started. I retreated to the corner. Two guys were already down. The other two guys were wrestling. I got some courage and ran toward them. I stabbed the guy on top in the head. I couldn't get the knife out of the guys skull. "SHIT" I yelled. I backed up and pulled a knife off on the dead guys. The other guy ran toward me and tackled me. He tried to stab me in the head, but grabbed his arm and stopped him. He was strong. I knew I couldn't hold him much longer. I was covered in blood and ready to die. Then I said aloud "let's not give them what they want." He didn't let up. 

He said "sorry, but if we stop they will kill us both and its better one of us survives." I punched him in the face with my free hand. He collapsed to the floor. Now I was on top. I'm pushed his knife away from him. He realized he had been defeated. I didn't kill him.  I dropped my knife to the floor and sat. The guards came in. The two guards walked to me. Quickly and ferociously I slit both of their throats. I pulled the guns off the guards. I gave one to the other guy. We grabbed the keys off the guards then we walked to the entrance to get behind the one way mirror. We opened the door. We then saw the dictator and his wife 
BANG! BANG! We shot them both. The revolution had begun.

Well everyone's definition of success is different but for me I'd say accomplishing major personal goals is worthy of being called successful. I've been dropping for the better part of 5 years now, on average we'll say about 4-5 times a year. I graduated University with an honours BA and started Law School this year. That's everything I've wanted to accomplish in my life so I'd say it's a success story thus far. Also, moderation and good friends who are willing to call you out on your bullshit and keep you on track are great. Sometimes we get carried away, so it's good to surround yourself with positive and levelheaded people. Everyone can accomplish their goals if they prioritize and stay determined. Be safe, have fun, and live life. Don't let the small things bring you down, I find it is much easier to set and meet daily or weekly goals. Looking at the bigger picture can be intimidating. You caught me in a sharing mood, I apologize for the essay but I needed a break from all the reading. One love!

I'm glad to hear you support a woman's right to choose, but I don't understand the point you're trying to make by your post. The part about forgetting medicine altogether and letting evolution do it's thing?

Not because he flipped, but because he waited till the last day to flip. Had he flipped earlier, then we could have had Leonard Williams.
It's perfectly fine, it just doesn't work for me. You have to figure out the sense of humor your friends have and what type of teasing they take to vs. what kind makes them really uncomfortable.

I dont understand the need for people to conflate the personal opinions of an actor to the charatcer they are portraying. 

Shatner didnt write the script, Roddenberry did. Shatner is an actor, its a job you morons.

How does the actions and opinions of a persom lessen the virtues displayed by a character on film from over 50 years ago??
The 2 at least could stand to be improved, I actually found it worse after the Xing Tian patch where they supposedly updated it to be clearer. The 4 I don't think is a huge deal since you shouldn't be looking at it anyways

I bet there is a good chance he resigns. Either to avoid an impending impeachment if somehow that occurs, or he gets frustrated about everyone being against him and tries to blame everyone else for his failure and still tries to claim victory in quitting somehow.
A former friend of mine thought Spic was just a casual form of Hispanic.  She lived in a very Hispanic neighborhood. I really don't know how she managed so long without getting killed. Or at least being told why her language was offensive.
Well instead of saying "you can make it, do (insert miracle learning method here)" tell us the hard truth of: "You suck, git gud."

Because that's what it is. We're bad players, and a majority of us will forever remain bad. Stop treating us like cute little puppies in need of encouragement.

I agree, it's gotten rough to navigate through all the obsessive, intense opinions. I see this everywhere these days, it's impossible to have discussions.  You're either Team A or Team B and have to be a sworn mortal enemy of the other. I don't know what's causing this but it's making being a fan of anything a lot less fun. I am glad some of us are trying to bring a little chill to the table. :-)
Thanks for clearing that up.

That sounds enticing.
It's way less serious in tone than FFT, but you're still getting a Grid-Based Tactical RPG with tons of character classes [47 I want to say off the top of my head?], with lots of different abilities and a whole system of sub-classing to unlock new passive boosts and abilities. It's got a ridiculous amount of postgame too, there's an easy 70+ hour main campaign, and the postgame more than doubles that, before even getting into the randomized dungeon content
That's better, but that's music you hear during a race in an ATV/BMX game
You're describing any heirarchal system in the united states. People working at walmart, fast food; virtually any job falls under this category.

It's how business works. I don't know how this concept seems so abstract to people. I guess because you don't see yourself as a worker when you're in college: yes, you are an employee and the university is a business. 

Actually, I'd say that a student is one of those employees for a pyramid scheme, where they pay to be in it and only get compensation if they get other people to join in too. 

You're paying to be there and you only get compensation if you get your shit together; the college makes money regardless.

Not necessarily. Plenty of people with returns like that file through TurboTax et al all the time. I know someone in that same situation who uses TurboTax and hasn't had any issues. Conversely, I know someone who has an accountant and an equal amount of complexity who just got audited. It's not cut and dry at all.

Many of the large companies doing this provide audit support. TurboTax has pretty thorough audit support for an extra fee that is good for 7 years.

Pay the extra $60 for audit support that, very worst case scenario, you use with a CPA, or pay $1000 on having a CPA do taxes that may never get audited, and that you can do yourself when your schedule allows.

This is a little misleading.  Like, for example it shows that the White Day set is in February, but... Valentine's Rin will still be around til the 14/15, and then White Day Umi til the end of the month. Hanayo won't come around til the very last day of February/beginning of March, followed by Kotori in mid-March and Eli in the beginning of April (and it kind of staggers from there).

Like if we're looking at it strictly based on which month each card is FIRST available in, yeah, but the time frames don't quite match up with the graphic.  It's still very helpful, but everyone should be mindful that this graphic predicts them to come earlier than they actually will based on the current progression of the game.

My go to comfort food is a tuna melt, but I don't use mayo (if I do, maybe half a tablespoon since 1 tbs has 11g fat) and I don't fry it. I toast the bread to make it crunchy and warm to melt a bit of cheese and mix the tuna with my favorite seasonings. I like cumin and coriander, but feel free to use what you prefer! It's not quite the same but it curbs my cravings and I find it nostalgic (I ate a lot of tuna sandwiches as a kid)
I also do well with oatmeal which I mix with mashed bananas, occasionally peanut butter if I think I can handle it. Sorry I know that's kind of bland but I find it a lot more appealing when it's made this way rather than the typical brown sugar and cinnamon.

Try to get in to see the Supreme Court in action.  You can go in for a brief period (20 minutes or something like that), or you can go in for the full session.  Different lines for the two.

Also, contact your Congressman's office and get tickets to the Senate and House galleries.

If you do these things you'll be seeing the government in action (sorry, "action") rather than just looking at buildings.

No. It isn't. But it's not a true answer. It's like saying that Colgate, OK is as big of a BDSM scene as San Francisco. One can measure the size of the scene in a city and one can compare it to another city without it turning into a pissing contest. This is what I attempted to do.
It has to do with the feeling of the podcast more than the podcast itself for me.  
When I listen to it it's like I'm with some of my friends and we're just goofing off making fun of something. I don't live near my friends 9 months out of the year, so I don't get to do that that often, so this fills that gap.

But if it's not for you then it's not for you, my brother listens to a ton of podcasts that I find boring and unfunny but he thinks are awesome and tells me to listen to specific episodes.
Awesome thanks.

You can play around with expected voting levels all you like, and say that compared to previous years Bernie voters didn't actually stay home any more than expected. That's not the point. [Young voters don't turn out.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/20/the-lopsided-age-distribution-of-partisan-politics-visualized/) They're liberal, they're young, and they don't fucking vote. That's why Trump won. That's why he even had a chance, because of that s-shaped chart. Young liberal voters don't vote at anything like the rate the boomers vote at, and anyone chasing them is an idiot and is going to get fucked over in the end.
I read in the Karen Reddit that someone doxxed her on r/Nintendo switch, and someone got banned for 2 reasons. 1 doxxing and 2 bullying, because he referred to her as a "him" and someone pointed out it was transphobic. So I think she's a transgender but I need to confirm so back to digging.
The analogy that would be more appropriate is that the nuggets are the game, the base thing you paid money for. 

The sauces are the DLC characters, which augment the game and add a little spice to it, and you have to pay a little extra to receive it.

The skins and shaders are the box, the change how the nuggets are presented, but they're still the same nuggets.

Also, if you're getting dry nuggets, then you're getting overcooked nuggets. They should have a crispy interior, and a moist tender interior.

I have a very, very poor sense of smell. My sister (playfully) called me 'stinky' fairly often as we were growing up. Now I live in the constant fear that I smell, my room smells, and everyone knows it but nobody says anything.
I get that people want to push towards a goal, see progression, and feel bad ass with awesome stats. I just don't understand the whole "I want to be there now" attitude, especially when people finally get there and are always disappointed with the amount of stuff left to do.

Thanks! It actually started as a bunch of my house-rules for D&amp;D, but diverged. My group likes D&amp;D and not really anything else (although I've been trying to get them into world of darkness). The d4s is so that you generate more average ability scores, because having a bunch of 13+ ability scores in this game would break it. We've played about 3 campaigns with this method, and I've never seen any score be higher than 14 or lower than 7 at character creation, and my group has enjoyed that.

Go to your LBS of choice and talk to them. Best case scenario is they agree to assemble it and you pay them for the service, but also let you hang out and see how they do it. Just with that you establish a relationship with the shop and learn at the same time. Wouldn't recommend assembling yourself unless you know what you are doing.

That's because the world doesn't need more Objective-C books, and Swift books are obsolete 2 months after they're printed.

It hasn't 'dried up', there's just not a big reason to keep making documentation and tutorials for a language that's been around for a very long time.

Three dozen Swift books in 18 months because only the latest one is still relevant....which kind of proves the point that the writer was making.

Yeah. There's parsers you can download as addons so you can monitor your DPS as well as the rest of the party's. Some people use it for self improvement, some people use it to judge others. Parser users themselves can be quite toxic (not dealing maximum DPS 100% of the time? Why are you even **alive**?), but parsers have their uses.

The differentiating factor in BA and BS degrees isn't so much the major field of study but the supporting core classes in your general ed requirements. For instance, the naval academy only gives bachelor of science degrees, regardless of major, because of the amount of science classes the require every midshipman to take.  And as a counter example my brother has a Bachelor of Arts degree in computer science... go figure.

Hershey. By design of the company's ownership, most of their profits go to funding a boarding school for disadvantaged children in Hershey, PA and other charities. Milton Hershey (founder of Hershey) was raised in a very unstable home and his wife, Kitty, was infertile so they never had children. They founded the school to help originally orphans, which later became simply disadvantaged children. The school is endowed with the entirety of the founding family's fortune which was bequeathed to the school after Kitty's death. The Hershey Foundation now owns a majority stake in and control of The Hershey Company and all of the Hershey theme park. And the Foundation's primary beneficiary is the boarding school, making it the most well endowed high school in the world and amongst one of the best endowed educational institutions globally.

It is completely unbelievable, the stud fee wouldn't have been anywhere near $1 million.  Looks like it was $2,000.  

Of course a son of Secretariat existing in Texas is possible because they were super cheap, they were all over the place.  It's the $1 million that was absurd.  

I think the highest recorded stud fee was $500,000 for Storm Cat, but there have been a couple of stallions with private fees that are rumored to be $1 million.  American Pharoah's is now private.

I doubt Clonidine would ever cause zombification in a reasonable dose. It will lower your blood pressure and help with any shaking/sweating/other peripheral anxiety symptoms... but that's probably about it. It's an alpha blocker, not a benzo (you might have it confused with Clonazepam).
Screw machines were made in the time before CNC. These machines had multiple tools that could all move on one axis. By breaking up the different cuts into stations, the cycle time is reduced to the longest cut. 

This machine turned out a part every 13s. In a similar single station cnc, this part takes ~25 seconds. 

Overall, it is the gatling gun approach.

I think there's this misconception that anyone who has the issues that we do are currently young and going through that phase that every teenager goes through "I'm 16 and will be alone forever woe is me." People see that and assume that anyone on the internet complaining about our issues must be young because *"of course* you'll find someone eventually, everyone does!" I see this attitude a lot on the metasphere and it's positively infuriating every single time I do

"It gets better" is both patronizing and completely ignores anyone old enough for it not to get better because that's inconvenient to their perspective

Same wavelength here.  Always felt the only reason for the marriage contract on the wall is if someone is going to have kids.  Even then, it's a concession to societal pressures, and it's still no guarantee of anything - as so many people want to believe.  Who needs the financial entanglement otherwise?  Why would anyone want their SO to be around because of a contract rather than an innate desire to be there?

IT's a bug,

Same thing happened to be a few weeks back, (my game had crashed) but i was still in the world, my other mates who i was in that squad with (On voice) told me that people were shooting me but i was not dying.

I also saw this happen to my brother who had d/c. People were unloading into him and they couldn't kill him.

How does the freshman lottery work? The information on the form seems confusing to me as to when the parking pass is valid.

From the form:
"These parking permits are available for the McCutcheon Parking Drive Garage only.  Cost is $150.00 and normal purchasing rules apply.  Purchases may begin October 2, 2017 online at www.purdue.edu/parking. **The fall parking lottery privilege is only available through November 30, 2017**."

Is this saying that the pass is only valid for a month and 18 days? It doesn't make much sense for it to be this way, but it's how its worded. If it is only for that brief amount of time, then how would you park the rest of the year?

Ninja edit: or is it saying that you can only purchase the pass from October 2nd to November 30th?
But... I'm supposed to here.. ;p
I know you're being sarcastic, but damn that statement is kinda scary when you realise how many people believe in religious deities.

Yeah, I've played football for like 13 years now, and still playing. Currently in my last season for the U19 team of my local club. 

When I was little my dream was always to become a pro but I got a pretty bad injury when I was 12 that fucked up my legs. I was quite decent, but most likely never would have become a pro regardless of the injury but would have been interesting to see how far I could come if I didn't get that injury. Still have it to this day which limits how much football I can play.

If we’re defining ‘Centrist’ as someone who’s political leanings align with the majority of the electorate and ‘Radical’ as someone who’s politics veer much further away than the average voter. Then Bernie is much closer to being a Centrist than a Radical. A majority of voters agree with Sanders on many of his proposals including Getting money out of politics, increasing regulation on the financial sector, breaking up the big banks, providing tuition free college education, among other things. However, Bernie can be considered a Radical when it comes to the Israeli-Palestine issue in that he supports a Free Palestine which is something not many Americans would agree on.

I agree. Taking notes in the margins works hand-in-hand with highlighting. And, as you say, these book-briefing methods are perfect during cold calling.

In addition, I find that coloring a judge's opinion really allows you to visualize the figurative 'layers of the onion' to each judge's opinion. You soon start to understand that there's a method to the judicial madness; that writing an opinion--the epitome of legal analysis and reasoning--is as much an art as it is a science.

They care, but resisting Itachi is meaningless at that point.




 They both knew Itachi would win should there be a fight. Secondly, Fuguku's goals were crushed the moment Itachi started to wipe the clan. The Uchiha couldn't go on with the coup after that. It is evident that the village wouldn't let them, even if the Uchiha had the manpower that was just slaughtered.








Fuguku knew there was simply nothing he could do, but give his son a few last words of advice. You're right though; it is impressive to have clarity right before being killed.

Thanks for the review! Not every style of book is for everyone, and I'm not offended that this hasn't been your cup of tea so far. 

I wrote this book with a style of pacing that's more similar to a web serial than a traditional novel - that means there are a lot of lulls, as you mentioned, and some bursts of action here and there. It's not a traditional rising tension -&gt; climax structure, which was absolutely deliberate, but I can see why it wouldn't work for some readers.

Prose, pacing, characters, and humor are all about resonating between the author and the reader. This discussion has been interesting because it's interesting to see that I've accomplished that with some people much more than others, and in varying different places. The split between people who liked the school vs. the tower, for example, has been fascinating.

It's also been really interesting to see the split on people who did and didn't enjoy the style of humor. 

&gt; I haven't a clue what 'resh' is meant to relate to other than be an analogue for 'shit'.

This particular one is explained in the War of Broken Mirrors novels, which take place in the same universe. I probably should have re-explained it here, I was just expecting that most of my readers were coming over from the other books, since this was designed as a spin-off. Oops.

&gt; There's enough to keep me interested and I'll read it to the end. 

I'll be curious what you think of the ending.

[Folsom in San Francisco](http://www.folsomstreetevents.org/gallery/) is an actual permitted street festival, but even Vanilla sitcoms use green screen to do scenes on "New York streets".            

For Eastern Europe and the US rustbelt, there a whole pile of empty derelict streets.    Call it an art flm and the council will do your paperwork.   Call it a guerilla art film if you don't want to leave a paper-trail.  

But here's the thing, if you have a film crew, you can literally walk the streets with guns and balaclavas and people won't call the cops because they think it's just acting (if they don't see the camera then they may call the cops)

The gotcha for producers making commercial movies is unwitting background extras can sue you for money, if they are recognisable in the final movie and haven't signed a contract agreeing to be in it.       So for real films, anyone with a face should be an extra, any blurred blob can be real.

I'm rewatching the feed from earlier today where Paul is talking to Josh and Christmas about ways to provoke Cody and get in his head so that Cody gets aggressive and I find it repulsive that Christmas is using her own military experience to tell Paul that Paul needs different ways to say it bc Cody will just block it out if he heard it a few times and then telling him specific calm and superior ways to talk to Cody to truly get under Cody's skin bc Christmas knows how they're trained in the military. That's grosses me the fuck out that Christmas is using her own military training to help Paul torment Cody. What a disgusting human being. 

Edit: ok so I just looked it up and stand to correct myself on semantics: she was a contracter to support  the military and spent 4 years in Iraq with them. Not *in* the military. My point still stands though that I think it's gross that she's clearly helping Paul by telling him tactics she learned by working closely with the military in Iraq.

&gt;If you shape the artificial agent to have similar goals and limitations as a human, it would give a shit. I think human values emerge from the 'game' of life we play - meaning and emotion for us are value states and expected future reward for reinforcement learning - useful for selecting actions. 

Not at all, it's simply following instructions. If the instructions tell it to bang itself into a wall, it will do it. If the instructions say "jump off this bridge", it will do it. It will do anything its programming says to do, without reflecting. This doesn't reflect care, as it understood by heideggarians, care is what directs us to disclose meaningful (ready-to-hand) relationships between entities, hone skills, and 'unveil' the world without following rules or logic. This sort of 'care' is very difficult to understand in our western, materialist, cartesian culture - which very much believes that humans are merely biological machines following primitive desires and being controlled by our genes. All notions of free will, love, skill, and intuition are reduced to epiphenomenal occurences coinciding with brain activity that is the direct result of stimulus, nurture, and physical determinism. Human beings have no real freedom of will, they do only what their 'programming' tells them to do - this is an implicit belief for people who think we can create hard a.i. using representational schemas.

I suggest actually reading and studying some heidegger before being so dismissive of it and digging your heels into computational theories of mind (which I keep reminding people are entirely outdated nowadays anyway, if you still think the brain is a physical symbol system, you simply aren't up to speed with the latest in cognitive neuroscience).

&gt;meaning and emotion for us are value states and expected future reward for reinforcement learning

Just an asserted premise. This is not an obvious fact. To reduce all human activity to the 'anticipation of future rewards' is just naive darwinism. There are many things that humans do which cannot be predicated on future rewards, sacrificing yourself for ungrateful children - as just one example. If I am to take 'reward' as some tangible pleasure, something we can measure - then I just don't see it. Unless of course you balloon your concept of 'rewards' into something so ambigious and generic and empty that it just stops being scientific.

&gt;An AI placed in a similar context could rediscover human values.

You're confusing 'values' with logical facts. Human values are not based on brute, measurable facts. You might say "well the reason you like Dinosaur jr over Weezer is because when you listen to one, you recieve more dopamine than when you listen to the other." - but all you've done here is *added more facts*, because I can simply ask, "well *why* do I recieve more dopamine listening to weezer? "Well because your genetically predisposed towards it." "Why does one genetic structure release more dopamine than another?" "well, because..." etcetera, we could just go on infinitely, you could pile more and more facts on top, but we will never arrive at *values*, just more facts.

If that argument wasn't clear enough, imagine the fact "this surface is 39 degrees celsius" - is this fact a *value*? Not at all, it's just a measurement. A physical state which we have represented logically by units of measure. This 'fact' cannot have any value in and of itself. It has '0' value, and adding more facts, with '0' values, does not ultimately create values.
Totally disagree.

I'm not a fan, but I respect the hell out of him as a fighter for sure. I've been around long enough to know what is actually happening during the fight so I was entertained on at least some level. Can't really expect casual fans to pick that up.

There is an element of "putting on a show" but there is also "winning the fight." Woodley was pretty much in a lose lose situation because "putting on a show" would mean being vulnerable to submissions. So he had the "win the fight" option which was his game plan executed pretty flawlessly. I don't like it, but it worked. Can't be mad at that.

All Netflix originals have audio description for the vision impaired as an extra audio track.  It's professionally done, and they're usually pretty good about only describing things you wouldn't pick up otherwise (i.e. It's not constant narration, just a sentence here or there when necessary).  I use that a lot when I want something in the background.
I can honestly say I can never remember dancing in my life (I'm very anxious) until I started drinking a lot this last year, and it seems like fun.  The only downside is I'm terrified of doing it while sober and am too anxious to go anywhere that dancing would happen.  But at least I can dance during drinking games I guess.

The problem is you are trying to apply Ohms law to capacitors, capacitors and inductors do not function in terms of ohms law, they depend on a difference in 'phase' between current and voltage.

So when you switch the 5 Volts across the capacitor that is not charged already, you will draw a lot of current at first and then as the capacitor reaches 5 volts across it, the current will reduce to zero (virtually zero anyway).

So it is about "rate of change" of voltage that determines the current through a capacitor. That is the reason capacitors block DC and pass AC, because AC has 'rate of change' and DC is DC (no rate of change). 

A way to think about caps in a circuit is that a capacitor does not like to see changes in voltage, and will supply current to stop that change.

Inversely, an inductor does not like to see changes in current, and they will change their voltage to stop the change in current.

So in a capacitor the current "leads" the voltage, and in an inductor the current lags the voltage.

A capacitor stores its energy in an electric field that is established on the plates of the capacitor, and inductor stores its energy in a magnetic field that is stores around the coils of the inductor.

But if you try to understand them in terms of Ohms law you will quickly get a little muddled.

I highly doubt ATVI came up with this idea in the first place. Treyarch (and most likely PCDev in particular) must have fought hard to get the idea to the higher-ups, since it is for the sake of the MP community. People that don't like the decision are a minority anyway, since most Zombies players would buy the season pass regardless to experience all the maps.

I like people's vampiric idea, someone that's like Reaper that has weird inexplicable non-scientific powers.

I think it'd be cool to have DPS single target healer that blends Zenyatta and Mercy but with a unique mechanic: Life as a resource healing.

The character would need to be tanky in some way (either with shields or just large amounts of HP) and has a short ranged powerful beam (I picture Mercy's beam in my head but red as fuck coming out of his/her hand).

When targeting the enemy it will rapidly drain their HP (before shields and armour...which'd be weird) and heal itself. If it shoots an ally it will rapidly heal the ally while draining its own HP.

Now, the first thing you'd think is that such a character would be a massive fire magnet so there has to be some considerations. Firstly it should do enough damage that anyone stupid enough to get into mid-short range combat should pretty much guarantee their death, however teaming up would be fine.

The character would need to either have some sort of maneuverability techniques or at least a temporary shielding/damage immunity skill of sorts.

Finally the ulti should 100% be a vampiric aura, all allies in LoS gain like 20% damage as health whenever for 8 seconds.

Edit: Everyone else had the same idea. Cool.

Don't get hit.  Do you see a destroyer?  No?  Take evasive maneuvers anyway.  Do you see torpedoes?  No?  Take evasive maneuvers anyway.

Are you by yourself, far from friendly ships?  What are you doing out there?

You know what's really, really frustrating when I'm in a DD?

When my torpedoes keep missing enemy BBs because they keep changing speed and course, and when I can't get close enough to an enemy BB without being spotted by planes, cruisers, or a screening DD I didn't know was there.  Torpedoes are so slow.  They take so long to get there!  The enemy has so many chances to evade them that I simply must pray that the captain of the enemy BB is unlucky or not paying attention and that their team is uncoordinated.

But if you end up getting chased by a DD, sometimes you're just screwed.  If that situation sets up and there are no friendly ships to chase off the little pest, the DD has arranged the prerequisite conditions for victory.  Small, fast ships with torpedoes are a counter to battleships.  Meeting your counter can be unpleasant.

...Although if you're in a Fusō with HE loaded or you're in a Nagato and making them chase you through secondary fire, the destroyer's victory is hardly guaranteed despite favorable circumstances :D

There's a film I just watched, Inside Llewyn Davis. Give it a go. It'll help.

And just remember, for lofty goals such as these (wanting to be a rockstar, astronaut, actor etc), remember to aim high but be grounded at the same time. 

My advice to you is, make sure you have a backup, but NEVER give up on it. What you should do right now is pursue it. 

But.

If this is truly what you want then you have to do something. Everything you do from now has to be towards that goal. Mould EVERY decision in accordance to your ultimate goal. Accept your failures and learn from them. Enjoy the little things along the way and their little nuances. Rejoice in the small victories you have.

Good luck.

It's a weapon with a very high variability in damage multiplier. Most weapons have a small window of variability in damage, like 90-110%, 95-105%, 70-130%, etc.

Setzer's TM has a damage multiplier of 120%-650% which means it could either do typical weapon damage (not ideal since the weapon only has +1 attack) or crazy high damage or anywhere in between.

you would have to do a very robust rebuilding of the mechanics to reflect the variety and versatility of  real historical weapons, but in 5e, I don't think its necessary. the game is built around picking battle mechanics you want to use as you level up, combine that with an accurate weapon description ( the game might say great sword but that can be a claymore, Odachi or any other variety.) that can mean and you can build your own fighting style that reflects the qualities of the weapon of your choice.  Especially with the battlemaster.

I'd compare it more to a car having no lighting on the dashboard/wheel controls (radio, HVAC, cruise, etc).  Entirely unimportant during the day but could be really annoying at night if you need a control you don't use regularly and thus haven't memorized the location of.

I can touch-type just fine and could easily get through my day-to-day on blanks, but every now and then I need a symbol I don't regularly use. That said, when that does happen I like being able to just look at the keyboard and find what I need.  Backlighting allows me to do the same even when the room I'm in is dark.  Since I'm using my computers in dark rooms a lot, I consider it a very important feature.
It's from a comment on this quora post, and while you can see his response to the question, you won't be able to see comments if you don't have an account. This is the context.

"Only Neo-Darwinians, what few are left of them, still try to make evolution about “species” or “populations”. Evolution is organismal and entirely within organisms. It is about how change causes diversity and increased complexity in the biosphere, not about static populations in a static environment staying the same for long periods of time. Evolution causes selection, not the other way around. You are reversing cause and effect, a flagrant chronological order problem.

Trying to mix stasis with evolution is what is confusing the discussion. It isn’t a matter of whether we break down the scale to individual nucleotides in one individual or the entire population of the earth. The point is you can’t conflate stasis with evolution as if they are the same thing. If you want to discuss populations, fine, as long as you can distinguish change from stasis. Anyone saying “evolution by selection” is confusing the cause of stasis as if it could be a cause of evolution. Its like saying “working hard gets you money and allows you to take vacations to relax, therefore, vacations make you money.”

The examples I gave may have been lost on you, but they were intended to show that proliferation is NOT required for evolution. An endangered species is just as much evolved and evolving as it would be if it were more predominant in the population. Out of 10 to the 40th power living organisms in 4 billion years, 10 to the 39.5 have been bacteria. They outnumber even our own cells within our own bodies some 10 to 1, yet they are almost identical to the ancient bacterial genome. On the other hand, as evolved as elephants are, their population is minimal. Population percentages and evolution are two related but quite different topics. You are just not being relevant to the conversation of evolution.

I had to laugh imagining your alleged groups of scientists sitting around asking if they think traits beneficial to survival would proliferate or not. Laypersons on Quora talk about “it conferred an advantage, thus it exists” but few scientists blow that kind of non-explanatory hot air.

Actual scientists talk about genoplasticity, transposons, polyploidy, hybridization, duplications, deletions, activation and silencing, symbiosis, frameshifting, transcription factors, environmental monitoring systems, homeostatic regulatory systems, intercellular signaling, extracellular vesicles of genetic elements, codons, horizontal genetic transfer, chromosomal fusion events, DNA repair mechanisms and epigenetic methylation, histone modification and nuclear localization, not to mention the study of precise molecular folding and allosteric sites on complex proteins.

No scientists in THIS century are interested in “competition for limited resources” as a faux cause of evolution. They just can’t dumb down that far anymore."

The serious attraction to abuse is a whole new range of issues, which is far removed from normal sane interactions. That is connecting to her in a very primal way, and because females have not left the paleolithic era behind they really love it, though none will ever admit that to ensure they maintain their special snowflake membership.

It is mostly accurate that she won't or can't "remember" the beating she got the day before, because of how her brain operates, which is always the clock analogy I mentioned.

Outcome independence is also a separate issue from the that, because it's a male drive or action and not dependent on whatever insane shit she can rationalize. If you thump her with a bat she will crave it more and have no intention of leaving so the IDGF attitude just magnifies everything in her warped mind which is why the female will never leave the abuser, and that ties into the "I can change him" attitude which is also running at the same time.

Think of it like this, you have Beating V1.0.3 running, and in another window you have obsessive v2.59 running, then you open another window and run IDGF V2.7.9 so while they are all different programs, each one is still consuming memory and still needs the right hardware to run correctly.

Original data 1100111 1011101 0111001 0101001 are split into lines, and you take the parity both horizontally and vertically. The parity of course is just the XOR of those bits so the vertical or horizontal strip has an even number of 1s.

 | data | row parity
:- | -: |-:
data | 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 | 1
data | 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 | 1
data | 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 | 0
data | 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 | 1
column parity |  0 1 0 1 0 1 0 | 1

When you transmit, you'll add the row parity to each block, and you'll also send the additional final block: 1100111*1* 1011101*1* 0111001*0* 0101001*1* *01010101*.

If you change a single bit anywhere, the mismatching parity in both the row and column means you can pinpoint the exact error and fix it (you know the parity is wrong when there's an odd number of 1s in a strip). But can you change two bits such that the error is detectable but not fixable? Basically you need to break our ability to pinpoint the exact position.

I like how the commentator is oblivious and talking about them throwing you under the bus as your PoTG is going on.
I really like what you did with the writing!

No.
For my clinical medicine class, I would write up my study guide during the lecture of guest lectures. All our guest lectures were presented in different ways but I need the material laid out the way I like it. By writing up my study guide during class, I had more time to study after class and before exams. Clin med took up, by far, a majority of my study time (other than anatomy first semester, blehhhhhhh) and this helped me save a lot of out of class work time.
I just listened to it, it was there. Check in at the 16 minute mark or so?
Actually Rickrolling is just a lame old-fashioned form of trolling.
Got to say that Roman is selling it pretty good this match.
It's the autofocus. My wife as a 7D, the USM lenses focus insanely fast on it and servo mode works really well for sports and dogs.
It might be.  My right grey joy con always appears less charged than my left one and I always get the 'low battery' notifications as well.  I called Nintendo Customer Support last week and they told me to charge it w/o the dock.  So far its worked but they told me to test it out w/ another joy con to make sure the system is not defective :/
sorry can't get on right now. Can you give me ~2 hrs?
Thanks man. It's really been a struggle this season but getting that cortisone shot in my wrist a few weeks back REALLY helped. It's felt like having to relearn how to throw the ball, but hopefully this is the start of a good trend.
Sabo being alive was blindly obvious, though. Why would Oda even show those flashbacks introducing a new brother if he was just going to stay dead?

So it's not a speed run?  A speed run would probably just rush plateau and then kill a few dungeons in the castle then go straight to Ganon.

Like what I would imagine cum tasting like. Not really like ecstasy though... even in small doses. It's the farthest thing from MDMA, being that Ecstasy is commonly used as a psuedo-psychedelic methamphetamine. I would almost consider GHB a barbituate or a tranquilizer.

Thought so! Thanks :)
I had an iPhone 6 running iOS 9. It was really laggy. Or maybe it was just me. Anyone else think iOS 9 was terrible in terms of framerate in the UI? I have tried iOS 10 on an iPhone 7, and I have to agree it is buttery smooth. We'll have to wait and see what apples planned obsolescence does to the 7.
I went to an American high school, and am at university in Canada now. In high school, people just seemed to do things with the sole purpose of writing them on their resumes. I was exceedingly difficult to make meaningful contributions to groups because they were stacked full of uninterested people and run by people who each ran 8 other service clubs and couldn't care less because they got their title.

In university, and I don't know if its because people have grown up, or if it's because it's a different country, but people are much more selective in what they do, and they mostly do it because they enjoy it or because they care. Getting those volunteer and leadership experiences are much more organic, and people aren't really doing it as resume padding from my experience.

But that last sentence is too real. It just about kills me when the employers are like "we want risk-takers, who can do exactly as they're told, and take no risks."
**Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, conditioner**. Not for dandruff but it keeps my scalp psoriasis in check.

Just had my hair cut short for the first time in years so I'm trying out a few styling products.

**Lynx** (called Axe outside of Australia) **Black Featherweight gel foam**: Seems pretty good, hair looks wet/shiny for the first hour or two but then dries out and looks fairly natural.

**Lynx Messy Look paste**: A bit more crunchy and shiny than the other one, don't like it as much.
Looks good to me! I picked up a Fender Mexican Jazz and an Ampeg BA115 for my first setup 6 yrs ago and it hasn't got old.
Flat Rate movers. You tell them what you have, how you want it packaged, etc days before. They give you a price and there's no surprises in the end... If you decide to go with them.
&gt;but XP was clean and stable

**After** Service Pack 2.  Some even say Service Pack 3 wasn't that great.

The initial release of XP was buggy as all hell, and had so many back door vulnerabilities the Village People thought it was a little bit promiscuous.

In regards to your question: Drawbacks

* A cursory glance at the Microsoft Website sees that Service Pack 3 for XP is no longer available.  You'd need to go to a third party website to download the service pack.

* XP is no longer supported, this means

Any new vulnerabilities discovered will not be patched

Any issue you have with drivers, programmes, whatever not working are you own.  You're probably just going to have to accept that it just won't work.


* You may find it hard to get driver support for your hardware - most definitely if it was released post XP support shutting down

Just to name a couple of things
Couple of my buddies came in at 23 and 24. By the time their contracts were up they felt like it was too late for them to get out and start another career or go back to college. Both legitimate concerns in my opinion. They ended up re-enlisting. One hates it, but they're both doing alright for themselves. Not to be negative, just food for thought.
Yeah I've been subbed there for a while and know their cool guys. Looking through this thread has shown me that  non-tankie left subs actually exist

"You're from Australia? Wow, your English is really good!"

I wasn't quite sure what she meant by that, until five minutes later...

"Your English is great, you probably don't need to practice anymore"

I can't speak for her, but since I'm dating a non-dancer, an amazing Valentine's Day present would be for him to go to a dance with me, take the beginner's lesson and actually give it a try. Not sure if that's something you'd be willing to do (maybe you have already), but think about it. You wouldn't have to become an amazing dancer, you just need to have a relatively positive attitude. 

Your actual Valentine's Day date can be dinner or something, attending the dance would be the present.

As a fellow Australian, i don't think we warrant a server of our own at the present time. Maybe when the game is fully released and if we have more Aussies, kiwi's and the Asian Community playing the game but for now during alpha/beta, then my answer would be to say no to it as we do not have the population to support a server.

I don't think he does know it's going to hit. He was just being cautious and trying not to celebrate too early.
"Optimal" accuracy is a bit of a misnomer, it's the length of barrel needed to achieve a fixed (1 degree?) amount of accuracy. Inaccuracy is inversely proportional to barrel length (minus the usually negligible casing length), so doubling your barrel length will double your angular accuracy.
What do you think my chances are? I'm a high school senior and I'm planning on applying and majoring in physics. My gpa is 3.98 UW AND 4.3 W. I got a 33 on the act and last year got 5 and 4 on the ap music theory and ap physics tests respectively. I'm a white male in California. My parents are divorced and both not working, though they remarried. Because of that, I moved around a lot on high school and live with my grandparents now. For EC's I did competitive show choir and classical choir and played football. I'm a life scout, working on my eagle.

Almost half his tackles are assists and combined he has missed an entire season due to injury. Not once has he played a full season. I thinks it's time to draft him some competition. He either steps up or we let him walk next offseason.

Long-shot candidates love to hang around, until the caucuses and primaries happen. They can do this because they're well-funded (as opposed to candidates Rick Perry and Scott Walker who dropped out early). When the primaries and caucuses take place, there's hard evidence that their campaigns won't succeed. Funding dries up and they generally drop out and endorse a remaining candidate.

I can't tell you O'Malley's thinking but presidential candidates are generally assertive, type A people who have been "on top" for much of their careers. They're surrounded by yes-men who tell them how wonderful they are and that they should run for president. It's just not in their ego to quit. If I had to speculate I'd say O'Malley is hanging on to press issues that are important to him, or to attack Clinton from the left and force her to take more left-leaning positions than she would if she had no serious competition for the nomination. Clinton has presented herself as the inevitable Democratic nominee during both her presidential campaigns. Dems don't like being told a candidate is inevitable. It's a challenge to them. So they want to run, and if not win, at least make Hillary work for it.

All of those beliefs are intrinsic to Christianity and are in the bible (perhaps not transphobia though). You cannot seriously choose to believe only some parts, can you? What's the point of this religion if you're making it mean whatever you want it to mean?
No I only see them in the comment section not on the list that's probably what threw me off.

Note most domestic Tokyo flights are through Haneda and not Narita. So if you're arriving in Narita from your home country and want to connect on the day of arrival, book now. E.g. We are arriving at Narita on Feb 7 and want to go directly to Sapporo. There was only one flight available after 3pm and it only had 2 seats left at this rate. Snagged them, then posted this. :)

I will not pursue this current motion, as the senate has shown it is not needed.

Junot Diaz doing Harry Potter would be amazing.
Yep. I grew up in the country and getting punk music was so difficult. I'd wait until my parents could take me to the record store in the nearest small city, special order the CD, wait for the album to arrive, and then wait for my parents to take me back. It could take months. Now I can get those albums in literal seconds. It was a little expensive pain in the ass but very special.

You can't really be a "poser" anymore (not that I'm complaining of course). If a kid asks you if you've ever heard of Bad Brains you can immediately access their catalog.  Wild.
In the intro to S2, there are multiple animal-type titans seen.  I get a "every living creature has a spark inside" kind of feel.

It's being laid out very clearly that the titans inside wall Rose were created there, since they didn't find any breach + what I presume to be Connie's mom titan.
Budget cuts for diplomacy and increased budgets for military. I wish the optics were better. Why we conservatives are not showing equal enthusiasm for the increased security and travel costs for extended trump family which is all over the place.

Aww poor bubba. Did the mean man yell at you?

You and your mates are riding like a pack of fools. You made multiple surrounding and intimidating maneuvers and pissed off more than one vehicle in the short space of your doctored video. 

How about learn how to ride like an adult. Or expect to come off your bike sooner rather than later. 

If you did that to me in Australia id get out of my car and beat you with a club lock and other vehicles would probably join in. 

You're a dickhead, you ride like dickheads so don't cry when you're treated like one. 

Also feel free to post the full video of your ride so we can see how innocent and safe you were all riding.

I like to do art, but I always have a vision and whatever work I do, it always falls short of that. So I figure that it's not worth the effort if I can't get perfect results.

Now I like drafting, but it's rarely ever used in today's workforce, often opting for digital drawing programs which take the soul out of everything.

You can't be you're if your you're...
**Tuition costs**: when I was in high school, more than half the kids graduating went to trade school instead of college. And the degrees in college were degrees in subjects that actually related to careers, like aerospace engineering or pharmacology. I have a niece who is a Performing Arts major and her boyfriend is graduating this year with a degree in Linguistic Anthropology. How on Earth are either of those degrees going to turn into careers, let alone provide a background for a job that will pay off the ridiculous cost of such fluff?

**Low wages**: That's a side effect of having an unmarketable degree and no skills that people will pay money for. Unskilled labor doesn't earn high wages, and never has -- even back in the Boomer days. If you want to make money, learn a skill that people want to pay money for. And there's no shame in learning a trade. Learn plumbing or carpentry or roofing or electrical wiring, and you'll never want for a good paying job. 

**Housing**: it's always up and down, and over time it's a great investment. If it's too expensive where you live, move to a less expensive region, like the Southeast or Nevada. Unless you're on parole, the only thing stopping you from leaving town is your own mental inertia. Strike out to new locales and find better living conditions. 

**1099 employees**: Go a step further - - form an LLC and go corp-to-corp. I've been my own boss for 15 years now, and the idea of working for someone else now and listening to all the nonsense about wondering whether you're going to get a raise or get laid off or get your benefits cut is so ridiculous to me now, I can't believe I put up with it all those years. There is no advantage to making money for someone else. Be your own boss as soon as you can, and you can set your own salary and decide on your own benefits.
We had one. Just a normal family.
I know a guy who is a registered sex offender for public urination. It was the middle of the night, he was on a dirt road miles from the closest house. Unluckily for him, a deputy sheriff drove by and caught him. 

He's a pretty nice guy.
what if it was a bomb... and he was hijacked right befroe the show and they have to do a good show or it'll blow up
It looks like a Haitian port-a-potty in there.
Lol!
I guess it makes sense though.

I mean, if it was the archers that killed St. Sebastian for example, wouldn't it be natural for him to pray for his killers? Thus, him being the patron saint of archers and archery can be seen as a sort of prayer for his killers, in a way I guess.

Oh I definitely lose my temper, I just try hard not to inflict my temper tantrums on other people. We take a moment to calm down, or table the discussion for later, once we've thought about it. 

I study brain activity during certain mental states, which helps me understand what I'm capable of. Basically, when you're furious, the lights turn off in the front of your brain, b where all your communication, reasoning, and empathy lie. Pretty much all that's working is your brain stem, so you're essentially an angry lizard at that point. Nothing really beneficial is going to happen if my husband is trying to talk sense into an angry lizard, or vice versa. So we just chill down until our other parts of our cognition come back online and we can have a productive conversation. 

Knowing this also helps me with my children. If they are freaking out, I never bother trying to get them to listen or do what I want or whatever. It never, every works because they are neurologically incapable of doing it. I calm them down first, and then talk. 

And honestly, the idea of myself as an angry lizard is so funny to me, that just remembering that that's the mental state I am in in that moment can sometimes be enough to help me snap out of it.

His story about that on the podcast was pretty funny.
the first seat belt boobs.  one small click for man, one giant shtick for mankind
Some look pretty cool. No plans on getting any myself, but my cousins have some intricate, well-designed ones and I appreciate the time and artistic ability put into them.
Yea, when you take a shot like that, the smart thing to do is either clinch or take the KD and grab your bearings.  The sound on that punch was amazing...
no problem, good luck
Just one episode ago, everyone was like "wow, that's a HUGE nevermore", and there was all this buildup about how it was powerful enough to break the stadium's barriers, then CHOP dead in fifteen seconds. Ruby even swatted it away with one of Penny's knives, which was just a regular knife in Ruby's hands. Like...what is going on in this show? Have we even seen a grimm actually manage to injure a regular person? What am I supposed to be worried about? Cinder getting a powerup? I know she's going to get the powerup because nothing ever doesn't go her way.
Yup, this is totally unexpected, but very welcome. Finally, something non rng!
You make it sound like Ugin's the good reflection of Bolas or something... X3
Still nothing. Ive been told to expect something the last week of May.
You know, if there was a vamp hunter he'd be able to read that chat. Just saying
I already feel this strange presence of cult-ish Fieri fanboys looming. 

*shudder*

I've broken some sacred reddit law, didn't I?

Not that slutty, I guess, but I was big into cars growing up, and wasn't that much of a drinker. I went to a class party at the beginning of summer when I knew that all the cool guys would be getting wasted there.

I waited until the end of the night, offered to drive all of them home (with my friend helping pick me up and go back to the house party), and every single one of them made out with me in their totally-fucking-souped-up cars. So fun. I had gone for the possibility of driving their cars, and got some serious lip service too.
&gt;more *typical GRRM stuff*

So we definitely won't see Return of the King and Two Towers is going to be shit.
&gt; Very convenient that we see no imperial flagships ripped asunder by mysterious weapons, hulls aglow with an unknown substance and all crew and data obliterated. Very convenient indeed.

So I'm guessing you haven't [seen this yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D4k8_v4xzo)?
you have to do all the decisions about what fights to start and which to avoid but never get any credit for it, and you get the usual games where you have to solo-support a bunch of self entitled peruvians, it's not fun
Exactly. They know what it's like to be at the lowest low but were able to turn themselves around. It's also great since the PC has doctors and such to help out. I think something like the PC is a great testiment to how far the WWE has come in the years since Jake and Golddust started. Of course it's not perfect but it's so much better now.
Damn son
I just hope he's honest. He was clearly unprepared when it came to fighting from his back.
Poutine..
It's a hot one today, huh?
I don't think normies know how to 7 proxies. They're fucked.
The girls are gonna be totesss excited about your surprise Cynthia
It's supposed to be, yes, but there ARE plenty in this sub that are genuinely upset over it. It's ridiculous.
had no idea who he was until VSL started, but ever since then i've been a fan. seems like a really decent guy and that's a slightly unfortunate, but ultimately nice reality he finds himself in. hopefully he can spike a tournament or two and make it onto the PT.
And now you're secretly being investigated by the government.
I do and it's just something I've never understood because I've always been able to move on easily.
I play the exact opposite way. Set up my tunnels of death and pick off anyone that makes it through.
That's never stopped this sub
**AROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
Done!
I work as a custodian for my local school district.  While I was working at an elementary school I was cleaning the Special Ed room when I saw a name tag the really stuck out to me.  A little girl in that class was named Karma.
Could you add something? :)
yea, just drops you off a cliff doesn't it. i just finished it myself and now have more questions than answers.
''I got burned by you once. It's not going to happen to me again..."Dean Ambrose
Check out Genghis Tron's album: Board Up the House.
Why not link the broken page and get a real answer instead of a guess
Usually if you see makeup or brand names from china or HK, it's fake
Go for it! The way the story is told is a bit different from Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Without giving too much away, the book is divided into sections, each containing a story told from the perspective of a different character. These characters all have a certain connection though and they all tie up together in the end. Brilliant.
One day in high school, I reluctantly found myself on the Cross Country team after getting cut from soccer. Six years after graduation, I'm still running. I learned how to not hate running, which has given me a sport I can do as I age.
I bought a $125 one on sale... two years go though. I want to said it was the old Aiden ones, but on the tag it says Modern Slim Fit, 98% wool, 2% spandex, I forget what I paid with the discount, but I know I waited a while for a discount and then got it in Dec 2015.
Wanted to make a transmog around my new PvP appearance. The new PvP S1/S2 set looks great but appears WAY too bulky on female Blood Elves, so I switched it up.

Item List:

Shoulders, Chest, Leggings, Wrist, Belt: S1/S2 Legion Horde Hunter PvP set.

Boots: Dead End Boots

Gloves: Fine Link Gauntlets

Back: Seacursed Wrap

I think my TV was close to $2K.

On a related note, I think it might be interesting to hear about people's most expensive impulse purchase. I impulse-purchased a DSLR for like $700 or so.
Like down the drain!

*Ohhhh!*
I value that well below heat.
Does you ass get Jealous of all the shit that comes out of your mouth?
[Pesky? I heard they were ok.](https://youtu.be/QgaRd4d8hOY)
I'll forgive you
Just this once
More like CNN'd it. Also, Yogi Bear has higher ratings.
They also frown upon hosting a server from your personal computer (within reason), and torrenting (not Dtella).
Yeah, like what if they made her W also give a passive 2/4/6/8/10% CDR?
You don't watch her? Sorry, can't relate
Not at all, I was simply asking a question. I should clarify, I'm specifically referring to in the context of the debate and discussion forum that this subreddit is.
Sounds weird but peanut butter spread across stain and let it sit for approximately 3 hours
Also, nobody seems to note that the money is going to charity. DE isn't even directly profiting from it.
Seems like a good start, pussy fart. Besides, he has a huge following and I can guarantee you are not the first of his female fans to send him nudes. He comes to this sub often so he'll read this anyway if you don't feel like reaching out any further.
Use 'Nash equilibrium' next time, and see what he says.
I have mixed emotions about this. I see why they did it to mix it up really. I think the real issue is that the selection process needs some tweaking. This concept (two people) would be cool if the teams were real survivalists and not people like me who say "yeah, I could do that". Although I am pretty good at fire by friction. I may have a leg up.
It's amazing how being truthful and uninterested in talking about people is "weird" nowadays. I've been struggling with this in my life lately.
Rav4 has a locking differential.  Also has better safety/convenience equipment with no extra cost.  The Hybrid will get you much better gas mileage in the city, less maintenance, and more towing capacity.
In a thread about people being toxic, you come in with that hot toxicity. You wanna know why you don't get BM'd? Because *you're that guy*.
I know, that's kind of why I got the game because all my friends are getting it and I didn't want to be the only one without it.
This is completely normal for someone getting stoned for the first time. Especially if that person has anxiety. My little brother in eighth grade found my stash and decided to try it by himself.  Outa a huge gravity Bing. My brother thought that his heart was going to explode and he thought he couldn't breath right. So he ended up called the cops (true story) and hung up on them when they answered. So the cops and ambulance show up at my house to find my brother in his underwear watching dora  the explorer in Spanish covered in cheese doodles. Laughing uncontrollably.. I ended up coming home to see this grand finale. My brother has always dealt with anxiety, panick attacks and is a mild hypercondriac from time to timd.. So I guess he became over  conscience  of his breathing and his pulse and had an anxiety attack.. after knowing what to expect and what the high is like, he never freaked out like that again and has been smoking Tree ever since.. and all my friends rip on him from time to time.. the kid that got stoned and called the cops on himself.. 😀
Don't forget Strong Jaw which would stack with Animal Growth to increase your bite dice by 3 steps total. Also pray that the enemy wizard doesn't have Greater Dispel Magic since it will be getting rid of at least your top 3 spells (Animal Growth, Atavism, Strong Jaw/Bull's Strength). Or Blindness. Or Dominate Monster. Or Mirror Image. Or Invisibility (at least you can use Scent as a move action to locate the square if they're within 5 feet of you). Etc etc etc.
You joke, but this is a central tenant of feminism - anything which is good for women or bad for men is rationalised as somehow being part of patriarchy (either because it is actually bad for women, or because it justifies something that's bad for women).

It's like if you find a contradiction in a holy book - a true believer will say "Actually, there's a good reason for that, and it proves that our side is actually right". Idealogical libertarians (the kind who will find some way to blame the government for everything) get that way too. So do idealogical socialists. Ideologues of any kind, really ... it's sort of their thing.

But yes, EVERYTHING being part of patriarchy (thus bad for women) is a central tenant of feminism, and they can never admit otherwise.
brother.

this is one of my all-time faves!!
Do you know what field you'd like to work in? If you're interested in the tech/product design, see if you'd be interested in [UW](http://art.washington.edu/design/) in Seattle.  A number of grads in the last 5-7 years, like myself, have been working in Seattle/New York/SF(Silicon Valley).
I'm in STEM, so it may be different in the humanities, but I did the same thing when I transitioned from undergrad to grad in that I did a conference talk in the fall after I started on some research I did as an undergrad. It was totally fine, and I'm glad I did it. I also spent some time honing my undergrad thesis into a journal paper, but really all I did was do some calculations with the grad students and make some figures. My advisor actually wrote the paper.

Don't forget to have some fun in the summer and don't make it all work, though. It's (likely) the last free summer you will have in a while so don't burn yourself out before you even start.
Better not tell her about that Nazi, Frank Zappa, and his problematic views on free speech.
... AND FUCK MY MOM FOR MAKING ME CLEAN MY ROOM!
Aaah okay! You're the same guy that painted the amazing snow camo Chimera, right?
wish i had a firesweep bow i could give to my setsuna and I would have to keep life or death on her as i dont have a bunny lucina :(
Let me guess: Month five is all of these things at once.
Thank you for **Hidden &amp; Dangerous Action Pack**, I will definitely enjoy it. :)
Or they could have made a sequel with the original, competent actors that everyone loves. I'd rather see Dan Ackroyd take a shit than watch this film.
That and Stone Cold talking to himself walking down to the ring are two of my favorite things from that era.
~~you teamed tho~~
Well that explains it...
Basing off of what I saw on AMS
Exactly
I boosted a little. Contact in the 50s Power in 40s.  Discipline in the high 50s speed at 70. Arm at 73 and Acc at 71
yea, okay, this is cool but come on stop straying away from the research

go to thundersplace, of course, alot of the good things might get destroyed and this is IF there's no research or preparations done beforehand.

this is why we need people like you, reader, to ignore this dude and keep on- post your results to thundersplace.org, that's where all the research goes to

stop being a crab man, let things flourish, it's better than ignoring them

yea lot of things are destroyed trying to improve them but that's why there's innovation
No, he's a good dude and hasn't deserved the hate he's been receiving. That whole booing thing that happened at the United Center the other night was pathetic.

i feel like this odd push for people feeling heroic or accomplished for doing the most minor new tasks is indicative of a growing cowardice. i hope i'm wrong.
Ignoring the large gap in your story where the Club was champions.
Yeahya! I've had the green ones, but not the darker ones yet...I hope you have a nice one though! Live in love
Which is why I wish they would. Maybe it will put the thought out of her mind forever.
The Base game is a full game and the dlc is add on content because it adds on to the base game. You are still paying for a full game, which has more content than games used to for roughly the same price.

You can play and enjoy IJ2 without ever buying the DLC. In my opinion there is a subset of gamers that have just gotten greedy and continue to demand more from developers while wanting them to keep the price the same. 

I say this as someone who bought the ultimate pack without expecting anything extra than what was in it because Developing and balancing characters takes time and money.
This is actually normal to see in the railroad industry. You often see them throwing ties out of cars to do tie replacement jobs.
i dont even have a single ***good*** legendary
tried deleting your precompiled file for botw?
BOOOOOOOOO
LaCrosse Syndrome. Something to do with alcohol abuse.
you copied me
Don't ya mean "Free Willy?" (Bot)
This story isn't slutty at all so it doesn't count.
Yup, bad game mechanics are bad.
[](/HeyGuys)
Meredith and Suzyn?!?!?!?! Cmon!!!!!!!!
So raids that are like, 40 minutes later. I really wish I knew why this was working weird.
Ladies and gentlemen, the House of Horrors match is now a House of Horrors Fatal Four Way match!! grabs a refrigerator from under the ring...
If you bind LP and LK to RB and RT then put Heavies somewhere comfortable, then plinking becomes perfectly doable on a pad.

I actually can't think of a controller people use that you wouldn't be able to plink on. Fightsticks can do it, Hitboxes can do it, pads can do it, heck keyboards can do it. Just quickly go into the options menu and rebind your buttons.
Already read them. Though I was thinking of trying Half a King. Does pacey do that book too?
This comment actually makes sense!

The wonders of the English language never fail to please.
[removed]
I will have to tell you best of luck. I have shopped extensively. Lightly used mauris are extremely overpriced and the ones that arent are abused :x
Sign me up, do I need my parent's signature on any forms?
Shame on you.
I'll be up for the next 2 hours or so if you're available. If not, I'll be around anywhere past 11AM EST tomorrow.
I think the video was made in advance to the patch so he could upload it as soon as it went live, before that happens content creators have to withold said videos. That's the explanation I was given.
This is one of the coolest things i've ever seen
Yeah that was pointed out to me on /r/kitswap. The guy who gave me the kit told me it was authentic. My bad.
True, but that wasn't a stipulation of the original comment.
I can recite it with my eyes closed:

qwertyuiop

asdfghjkl

zxcvbnm
Yeah, when I remember my imaginary friend from childhood I recall him as an actual little boy.  I would become hysterical when anyone sat on him.  I'm open minded and curious as to what it was.  Oddly we lived in a Victorian house and he looked like a little Dickensian urchin.  Odd eh?
ohh! I was not aware of that
to win the match.
You'd be surprised at how many ppl I've seen start a raid without anyone near them as a couple.
Perhaps host dinner parties with your friends and force feed your guests!  
Then you have the win-win-win of not eating out if you want to socialize, getting rid of the food, and hearing their opinions/suggestions!
They are amaaaazing as a history nerd and a fan of the heavier stuff. I also occasionally play Manowar when playing CKII and EU4

Vaguely? Not really honestly. I know it's a thing, sorta similar to Dropkick Murphys or some of Bragg's heavier stuff?
If any of you want to help me collect the MLB  highlight video links, like the ones the game bot uses, for each HR I could add them to the viz in a way that will play the video when you click on the point for that homer.
My ex was abusive. One night he came home steaming drunk and proceeded to scream and insult me. He said awful things and I made him sleep on the pull out couch. My 13 year old dachshund waited until we were both asleep and she jumped out of my bed, went to the couch and took a shit right next to his face, then hopped back into my bed to cuddle. That girl has had my back since day one.

Just a little taste of how Cody and Jess treated people when they thought they had the power and the numbers!!

They stoked this fire and now dont like it when the wind changes and it blows back on them

This is so good! I wonder if Kiran thinks the same way about himself, seeing as how every game is another instance of the world.

See, the thing is, we really could have used a proper finale. One where the current story's dangling plots were ironed out (Braham and Rox, Rytlock, Aurene [where the fuck was Aurene? We've been away from here for ages!]) and then still transitioning into expansion stuff.

I'm really hoping that the reveal tomorrow is suitably impressive. I have faith pretty much only because of Team 1 and 2 at this point. And because the leaks made it look pretty hard to fuck up.

Jerking off / watching porn. Once a week has made my life so much better, I think a lot more clearly and I have more freetime / interesting things to do that isn't porn. When I first quit I got my first serious girlfriend, actually had sex lol. Would recommend only jerking once a week to anyone.

Federal LE hiring can easily run 2+ years. You should already be applying. That being said, some agencies will only take applicants if you're graduating that academic year (which typically means sometime between June and September). If you're graduating in December, you may be locked out of many of the federal applications until July or later.
Sorry, but I have my principles as an older brother.
Generally, we acknowledge that G1-G3 were genuine kids shows, and G3.5 is terrible. Bronies as a whole only like the 4th generation. It's understandable that you'd think kids' show, given its history, but in reality the series is a world apart from its older self. 

It's basically DnD-style fantasy, where the main characters are from a sapient race whose celebrations range from "Be friendly to each other on this day, or *or we will all freeze and starve to death slowly, because of hostile emotion-eating parasites*" for christmas, to "Gather candy *so you can offer it in a pile to spoil the appetite of a demigoddess who happens to be a cannibal who likes to eat children*"

You wouldn't expect it, but in-universe, that world is damn hardcore O_o

Funny you should mention it because I just finished (another) play through of DAII and I just love that game. I love all three very much but I've never felt as connected to my companions as I did in DAII. The way each character's story arc pans out and the amount of character development they go through is just amazing. It's so much more realistic than doing one quest, making a huge decision on behalf of your companion and somehow shaping their entire future (or even personality, in some cases) through one action. I love how each companion in II grows so realistically over ten years and they don't just listen to whatever you tell them. It really makes them feel like Hawk's family and not just her posse.

its pretty clear that battlefield one isnt as deep as battlefield 4, i personally think dice a shifting to a quicker turnover in their games for more profit. It's pretty clear when bf4 has like 80x as many guns  and its own engine/gun customization system, bf1 reuses the battlefront engine and animations.

Option 1: Somehow Roger Ver is completely ignorant of even the very basic level of the blocksize debate and has not read or listened to any of the arguments from the core developers outside his echo chamber. This would be a great example of how ignorance is spread over a mass via memes.

Option 2: Roger Ver does understand that disk space usage is a straw man argument, but would like his audience to believe it is a valid argument against the scaling roadmap and will increase the hatred and animosity towards the core developers. This would be an example of social engineering.

Given his history with public [low info judgements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4SCAw264qM), I think Option 1 is probably correct.

The whole reason I loved naruto so much when I first started watching was I loved watching characters grow stronger. Since it was my first anime, the shows I previously watched never really emphasized growing stronger and expanding arsenals like naruto did. Every time a character learned a new jutsu was hype as fuck for me, and the growing power element was got me so hooked. It was my dream that naruto would one day become a ninja stronger than any other, so when he mastered kurama and eventually gained God powers, that was one of the most exciting moments in the series for me. I also thought kaguya was cool as hell when she was first introduced, although I think she fell flat. But she served her purpose as an overwhelmingly strong final boss for naruto to prove himself against.
that's a lot more fun when you're out of the water than in it.

It's too much. These fucking people get such an inflated sense of themselves, they need to just stay in their fucking lanes before people stop listening entirely.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

Funny story, about PokeMMO. I have 7 friends that play it. They tried to introduce me (a PC-Pokemon noob ) into the game. I watched the how to install video on youtube and without noticing a video about P.R.O started autoplaying. I was blown away, I started asking my friends all about it (still thinking it was PokeMMO ) and nothing matched up eventually I found out I was watching a P.R.O video and not a P.MMO one.

That was on the same day I decided I was going where my eyes were aesthetically pleased. All 7 of my friends now play pro. 

I know this doesn't exactly answer your question, but almost 300 hours in a months time.  That's longer then I've played fallout 4, and Skyrim combined. This game is simply doing everything right. I absolutely love it.  If I couldn't play P.R.O, I wouldn't play any of them. End of story.
I know it's not THAT bad... but I'm unsatisfied and it's not done yet. it's not even flush with the rest of the coat. wondering if there is something I can use to strip the touch up paint off ALL the way that won't affect the factory paint, so I can just start over entirely with AMMO NYCs method.

&gt; Sub prime isn't risky.

Sub-prime is by definition risky. Being risky is what qualifies it to be subprime in the first place. 

Your own definition in that context is irrelevant--underwriters assess the means and credit worthiness of candidates, and those who pose a risk outside the 'prime' zone are sub-prime lending.

Sub-prime lending is risky, which is why it contains the larger coupon compared to prime lending. 

&gt; No bank will lend to you if you tell them truthfully that you have a 50% chance of bankruptcy.

A few years ago they would loan to you if you had no income, job, or assets (NINJA) because they believed the asset (homes) were guaranteed collateral that would turn a profit whether or not the buyer could afford the payment.

Banks have all kinds of motivations to make loans, and prudence or responsibility aren't always the most important ones.

Even after Crenshaw Phase I is complete, someone living in Hollywood will have to go through downtown, connection to Expo, and then connect to Crenshaw to get to the airport. Making the northern connection is going to be key to mobility.

I think its excellent we lost Kepler Prime this time, as the new players coming on board need time to get invested in this war (at least a week) before an enemy race gets eliminated. Having the bugs eliminated right before the new recruits join? That would be nothing short of catastrophic IMO. People might drop out before they ever got to experience Helldivers the way they should experience Helldivers, with all three factions.

Now all that said though, I don't think losing the war is good either. I would really like to see us win this one, because that obviously will have the best effect on the new player morale. Its inevitable of course, that we'll lose again, but hopefully it just won't be this one.

I'll ship the dfly to you tomorrow. What is your address?
Some changes that were made since posting to Facebook and I had forgotten to add were the possibility of picking which region you start on. To circumvent the story, the new threat's motive isn't fully known until reaching the newest region. Throughout the older regions, the threat is trying to take control of all the major landmark buildings and/or tallest point of each region, to which obtaining them will help their ultimate goal.
He would make for a great President in a political slapstick comedy movie...

My take on some, totally personal!

Best Overall Ninjustu: Sasuke. Like, sharingan + rinnegan, c'mon.

Best Taijustsu: Guy. 8 gates and stuff, totally wrecked Madara. 

Best Genjustu: Shisui, just because he has what's supposed to be the strongest genjutsu period.

Best Jinchuuriki: Naruto, because he befriended the beasts and is the jinchuriki for them all now.

Best Bijuu: Isobu. Marginally. Totally biased, but just because the backstory with Yagura and Rin is cool, and he ended up with Naruto. Plus, he's just this cool water-style-ly thing.

Best Character Growth: Sakura. For me honestly, she went from a totally whiny bitch to still a whiny bitch, but also useful.

Best Arc: Pain's Assault. Explanatory!

Best Villian: Madara, because he seemed like a legit/undefeatable threat at the end.

Yep, don't kill me if some are unlikable.
You are awesome!!!!

You can download the Tiger DVD image off of Macinosh Garden, and burn it to a disk. If you have a newer Mac with an optical drive, you can use the optical drive on that via FireWire to boot the iMac. That is what I had to do for mine. What is your reason for downgrading? There are a lot more modern programs available for leopard than tiger.
Midfield is a little weak IMO. Not too keen with Sterling or Townsend. Aguero's minutes are in question with the presence of Jesus as well, but i guess you could easily downgrade. I'd also think Cédric would be a better option than Dawson given Southampton's fantastic fixtures and given that you already have Foster.
&gt; Grand Rapids, which is a hardcore right wing Amway Dick Devos enclave that will go Hillary if neglected

I went to school at GVSU and I essentially never went into GR because I just never had to, but I still got the sense that GR was pretty blue. Lots of young people and artsy types. You sure you're not lumping GR in with the rest of West Michigan?
They still try to keep costs down even if they're higher quality materials.
Sweet :D

I appreciate this analysis. :) Thank you!  

&gt;That said... her grammer is a bit odd.  
  
I thought she just went and typed ahead like in those times when your hands just can't keep up with your thoughts? hehe. Anyway, I didn't think much of it. I actually like her reply more in a "lol that's cute" than in an "omg so deep" way.
That is so beautiful! I crochet, I can't handle two needles, just one hook. Call me a damn Pirate! Lol! So cool you completed it! I started 3 different blankets and finished zero. You go girl!
Read the article and get back to me.
lmao Raven is trying to make fun of Jess but all she's doing is complementing Cody on having a big dick.

She even sucks at insulting people.
Thank you my friend. We'll make it through. Congrats on your 60 by the way.
Exactly my point!
We had a code word but in a completely different way than the other replies to your comment.  Ours was for if someone other than my parents wanted me to go somewhere.  "Hey, PM_ME_YOUR_NOSE_HAIR, I'm your Dad's friend - your mom had an accident and your dad sent me to come bring you to the hospital."  Oh yeah, Mr.?  What's the code word?

I want to see when Tandy and Carol got remarried again because Tandy wasn't wearing his ring in the last episode and was in this one, a possible glimpse to if Pat and Mike are alive, what Erica's last name is because she is the only main character to not have it revealed and since it seems like she might be on the verge of death based on that promo, and how Melissa's state was solved and her reaction about it, and maybe even why Todd chose to regrow his mustache, and what Jasper's actual name is and what led him to speak.

I have so many questions, because of that time jump, but the jump was necessary to me as it helped move the plot up. But I was satisfied regardless, but it would give me more if those things were answered.
Yes. It's only 110 pages long so do it right now. Here is a pdf: https://media.8ch.net/file_store/916f7e1bd16f15767e50a485de09e5aaa895dfb3164e105fe3291b1c329c030b.pdf

When does it ever say Hashirama killed kids? 

Why do you like Sasuke so much anyways?
Choosing which spell to spam and how to get the most out of your turn is far more depth, as well as safeguarding yourself because the same thing can happen to you. That's far more interesting than any Final Fantasy game, where you just spam your most powerful spell no matter what.
Just look at the playable heroes. They have a little of everything.
It's weird that a married women has to publicly state she's bisexual.
You should have factored in the fact that some of us are stoned af
I miss the banter between Bobby and Crowley.

Bobby: "You sold your soul for two extra inches under the belt."

Crowley: "Just trying to hit double digits ;)"
That sounds like a presentation problem that's just kinda hard do fix with a live environment. I know people are worried about the Broken stuff because of the live crowd. So..what do they do? Do they just limit those kinda segments to a show like Raw and just have full matches on PPV? What exactly did TNA do when it came to that?
I totally agree.

It's hard to believe that Richard Curtis wrote and directed About Time, War Horse, Pirate Radio, Love Actually, Mr Bean, Bridget Jones Diary, Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and Comic Relief. So much talent.
Nothing wrong, its great! But because of mod rules you have to mark this NSFW
It will be a torrent server/web client setup. No problems handling multiple servers.

Someone else suggested OpenVPN and I liked that idea too. I will implement OpenVPN and maybe some other technology if necessary.

Plugins and scripts will be available

Moving torrents while downloading or seeding shouldnt be a problem.

I totally agree with your priority. CPU, RAM and HDD are a big concern, specially server side. Currently writting the code in C++ and being VERY careful to do things efficiently.

Sequential download and therefore streaming files while downloading will be a feature.

I have used RClone before. Thats a great project and would fit nicely for this pourpose. The idea is to make a lightweight client, so I dont think its a good idea to add this to the core program, however this could easily be done through a plugin or scripts.

This last one is tricky. Doing so may appear simple, but it actually is not. This would need a totally different program just to communicate with those clients. Also, efficiency has it's price and  a web interface that communicates with different torrent clients would probably have its efficiency decreased.

Thanks for your suggestions =)
OLGA was the shit while it lasted. So much free stuff on YouTube and torrents nowdays, though, not to even mention the legit free stuff like Justin. I only wish I had the internet when I first started banging out Sabbath riffs in the 80's. We had to buy those shitty Cherry Lane tabs for $20 per book, back in the day. Feal bad for the newbies like OP who don't know where to look for decent content and get duped by shysters, but it's still a hell of a lot cheaper to get an education nowadays than it was even just 10 years ago, let alone the almost 30 years when I first started.
I have white coat syndrome I was worried they were gonna tell me I was gonna die so I never told anyone and I too wish you the best
My guess: This is GW's best attempt to make truescale marines a reality, and put marines really how they should be on the tabletop, without invalidating everyone's current armies/miniatures. 

Everyone knows a marine should be much taller, stronger, durable, and be far more deadly.  A marine shouldn't have the worth of 3 guardsmen - but at the same time, they can't just re-write the way marines have worked, or retcon them entirely or they risk people being pissed off that their old armies (due to size, or equipment, etc.) is outdated.

I can see these guys being a new army in the forces of the imperium. I doubt they are going to be just a type of space marine, but instead, the 'new generation' space marine. With the new system, perhaps they will get 2 wounds, or higher strength. Maybe their basic transport will actual make sense (i.e. rhinos not being able to hold 10 marines in your wildest dreams).  I think GW learned from Age of Sigmar in that they can't ever hard reboot a setting without losing people (although I'd argue fantasy has more players now than it did before, but I don't even want to get into that, and risking something like that with 40k is far more eggs in the basket) - but they can soft reboot it.  Make it so that the new marines are way more appealing, and cool. Slowly pull people out of the old stuff, and into the new stuff. I imagine one day the old marines will just stop getting updates - 5, maybe 10 years into the future, just like they are slowly phasing out the less relevant fantasy armies or units.
I think she heard the audience reaction and wanted to be on Canada's good side.

In the 70's, Drive In Movies and Chill. In the 20's, Nickelodean and Chill. (Back in 20's, Theaters were called Nickelodeans, you didn't have movies at home. They were called Nickelodeans because it costed a Nickle to get in. That is where the popular kid's channel gets it's name from)

Honestly same. When SRIV got the embargo lifted people kept uploading unfiltered spoilers on YouTube, I am just afraid not to run into anything like that.
Yeah, the team was more to get me some defense wins than as a offensive team, as its rare that one of those heroes will be on the banner. I am also debating switching taco for Klien, who should be able to easily kill any of the blade tomes or reinhardt, but then it would lose the meme power. Plus I am not going for ultra high teir so it should be fine.

The last two are apparently how many times others mute you, which would indicate that you're getting on their nerves.  If they report you for communication abuse but didn't mute you, they weren't THAT offended, were they?

Cat knows not to eat the dragon, 'cause it's owners would get angry. Also, cat was exposed to the dragon enough times outside of it's cage that it sees the dragon as part of it's environment and not a snack. Plus owners probably watch them, so accidental mauling doesn't happen.
I mean, it depends. How hot or cold is it gonna be?

I'll get down-voted to help for saying this on Reddit, but video games are a big sink hole of killing productivity. I haven't played them in 8 years but they ruined my early 20s (Age of Empires, Half-Life 2, GoldenEye for N64).
Pretty sure it's becoming more of the Latter.
I thought I was the only one that cared about this.
Youthful scene isn't exactly high on priority list, just the type of people we are. Prefer saying in and cooking to going out.

What's a social life?In all seriousness, though, I have Monday night and every other Saturday night that are set aside for D&amp;D/Pathfinder, which is about the only way I keep my sanity. Forget about this life and imagine another for a few hours.
i mean you just reinforced the double standard again. both leffen and Mango have placements in 2017 that equal or surpass Plup's greatest career achievements and for them that's underperforming

plup gets exactly the rank he deserves if all he can get is 5th, even if he gets it all the time
he said that they are worth 50k pure. is that true?
I thought of it as some sort of unique character trait. I was only 10 years old at the time I was diagnosed and really didn't know what I was getting into.

[Not sure whether to respond en masse here in the comments, or edit my post.  What's the etiquette??]  

I appreciate all the responses.  I think what I'm most interested in here is this: do you trust the yeast labs?  I do.  When White Labs specifically calls out "does not ferment well below 62", I listen.  Well, if I read that before I brew, I listen (lesson learned).  As it turns out the WLP 029 is from PJ Fruh in Cologne, while 2565 is from Weihenstephan.  These are different yeasts.  Many of the responses here don't even include which strain the poster is using, just assuming all Kolsch yeasts are the same (which is what I did until I looked into it!).  

So I think this whole post is part question, part PSA.  These Kolsch yeasts are not the same.  They respond differently to fermentation conditions, and I experienced that... twice.  My experience what consistent with White Labs' documentation.  

Have any of you experienced that?  Do you trust the parameters the yeast labs provide?  Just curious.  

Thanks for the good discussion!

Oh. If you have projector housings, there's no doubt you should use HIDs. I'm only talking about older halogen housings. That's all.
Perhaps someone realized how much of a mistake construction was and is doing their best to keep it from infecting deeper into the game.
I've been mostly watching the later seasons, but have seen some episodes of the earlier ones. The latter are much grittier, but I enjoy it.
Agreed.  It looks like West Elm or something.
Oh. How bout that
There is an increased risk of drug use in transgender youth, but this is corollary to the amount of [homelessness caused by parents disowning their children.](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2010/06/21/7980/gay-and-transgender-youth-homelessness-by-the-numbers/) and the amount of immigrants was already declining well before Trump was elected.


That aside, do you think that the people he's nominated; Pence, Sessions, etc., who he chose for their positions, are free from their own personal biases?
I had this problem as well. One trick I learned is to hold eye contact for about 10 seconds then glance away at something else, then make eye contact again throughout a conversation. After a while you don't have to count and it becomes second nature. I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I hope it gives you an idea of how long to hold eye contact
Thanks. I am someone who's totally down with crazy stuff as long as it's consistent. Like in Star Wars, I don't nit pick when they have the Force. As long as it's fairly constant and doesn't suddenly let people teleport or do something out of character. 

Yep. You nailed it on the last part. In the comics that portray him correctly that's pretty much what has to happen. They try to reduce or greatly increase gravity (cuz he's strong but he's not superman, put him on a spot where it's 30x gravity and he's going to be almost unable to move). The Flash is one of the most powerful beings in the D.C. Universe.

Look at quicksilver from xmen. Cool stuff right? He's like the rc car compared to the Ferrari that is the Flash. He's on a whole different level of speed, to the point where he can literally go back in time on accident if he's not careful lol
Would i be able to enjoy it if i went into it alone? I have never played ARK so i have no idea what to expect but would the PvE be enough to keep me interested in if i were to do it alone?
I notice you apparently felt compelled to put "game" in quotation marks. This implies you know the difference between a game, and a profession, in context. So, thanks for your input.

I love the idea of dressing up guys as girls (I'm a girl btw). I've only succeeded in doing this once when I put my brother's friend in my old school uniform. It's thrilling. You look so cute in that photo btw!
OP's mom?
&gt; I made about 20 liters of it and froze most of it. Fed me 2/3 meals a day for over a month. Total cost of ingredients: 40 dollars canadian. It's mostly water, but the vegetables and a small amount of meat make it nutritious.

Eating borscht 2 of 3 meals per day is not an actual plan. Yes, you can live but way more stringent than most folks could stand.

Please be sure to take a multiple vitamin with one of those meals each day.

I do admire your tenacity.
Isn't CSGO gaining more players? What you said doesn't apply because we are getting more and more players even if the game is filled with cheaters.

probably the biggest thing that will be an issue is copyright claims. Usually when you go live the vod uploads to your channel but the youtube bot will claim the video if it hears copyrighted music and they will get all the profits from the video.
I was never able to gear a lon frenzy thorns barb in season. I main barb every freaking season and even went full meta zdps last season, and I tend to play out the full season start to end.

My non-seasonal barb has a decent lon frenzy set just from my attempts for like 3 seasons straight to gear it properly.
To bad I didn't pull anything that good though :'(
I have a 2008 like that one, and it looks identical.  The bodies were chambered starting in 2008 I think, so they are a little lighter weight than a earlier models.  It's normal for the finish to rub off on the white case lining.   They were around $650 (US) new in stores,  I paid about $500 (used) for mine a couple years ago.   I don't think they make anything this cheap anymore so they appear to be holding value fairly well.

Yup.. why go through the effort of figuring out how to line up a shot so that you know you are shooting at the corner of the window perfectly when you can just randomly shoot in that general direction and hope you get a few hits and don't hit the edge of the wall!

Eh, he had skill in generating hype. The idea behind BC3k is seemingly nothing more than to mix Elite with Starflight.

Hi, thanks for posting! We do appreciate you thinking of us even though we have to moderate.

Posts in /r/streetfighter must be related to Street Fighter directly and can't be about general FGC stuff, X looks like Y comparison meme posts, or other topics that just have SF as a title, etc. This is listed in our rules, [which you can read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetfighter/about/rules) and the original thread on the subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/2ylngv/rules_discussion/)

This means that any game that has Street Fighter characters and plays moderately like SF3, SF4, or SF5 is allowed! (example: CvS: yes, Marvel: no)

Please check out /r/fighters to see if you think your content is a better fit there for general FGC stuff or /r/gaming for an image macro friendly subreddit.

Eep! That's not good :( Definitely check the ingredients for allergens - lanolin does that to me and red dyes are a big one for many people - lipgloss is usually pretty moisturizing so it's odd to me that it'd dry you out! Does it have a minty or cinnamony taste? Mint oil and cinnamon oil can dry and irritate lips
This is actually a spoiler for a movie but I won't say because then it'll be spoiled.

Just don't do h&amp;r block, they made an error on my taxes last year and now I owe CRA a significant amount because of their error. H&amp;R Block isn't accountable for the screw ups they make, I know that much. My taxes weren't even overtly complicated, just school and a couple t4's. 

Taxes scare me but this year I'll go with a company that has staff that take more than a tiny amount of training.

Not really.. Reason people are getting on the Fine Bros case is because they're trying to not just steal money by watching someone else's content, but they're getting greedy and trying to steal even MORE money from reactors.

They can do it because they have so many subs (well, not as many now.)

A channel like Jinx's couldn't, because not only does he just watch videos on his bed like a lazy asshole, but he does not have nearly enough revenue.

Increases the bodies response to cortisol and raises cortisol in some people. Seems to lower it in others though. One good way to tell if it is happening, is if you have really bad anxiety upon waking. Your body uses cortisol spikes to wake you up in the morning and weed can make this process unpleasant for some people. You will also experience this, or late night panic awakenings from prolonged stress periods.
Thanks!

Yeah, having a more dynamic movement system would be really interesting.
That is very possible. Although considering we never hear from origins Samantha again lve always wondered if real Samantha is still "in the house" and the origins one was nothing more than an Apothicon troll who tricks the origins guys into releasing them with the EE.
Instead of going back to 1955 they could go back to 1992. I would like to see this.

No, I think when Lorelai looks at the portrait on the wall, it's just her recognizing the class she "would have" been a part of, whether at Harvard, or Vassar, or somewhere else.
Right? The Civil Rights Center is not too far from where the NRA convention is, and there are multiple references to blacks obtaining (or the inability to obtain) guns. Real world oppression, not wondering how to stop "senseless" violence.
Not really.  BMW had switched to metal and composite (not plastic) impellers by the time the 328 was being built.  It's usually the radiator hose flanges, t-stat housing, or expansion tanks that fail.
Just took a new job that is taking me back to Knoxville. Would love this. We have an NPSL team but it is run by some Christian youth org. Would love something with a more normal set up.
Me too. Congrats to both of us to find our happy places.
Agreed, its being disqualified was bullshit.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-the-soviets-got-scooped-on-their-own-historic-moon-landing) reduced by 87%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; Fifty years ago today, the Soviet space program launched Luna 9, the first spacecraft ever to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, or any extraterrestrial world for that matter.

&gt; You would think that in the midst of the Soviet Union&amp;#039;s intense rivalry with the United States, its leaders would want to flaunt the first postcards from the Moon, taken by a Soviet lander.

&gt; British newspapers scooped the Soviet press on their own Moon landing, and images from the surface were rapidly disseminated outside the USSR&amp;#039;s borders several days before the average Soviet citizen had access to them.

Instrumental is good, but the clean + harsh vocal combination just make this sound like generic metalcore to me. Oh, how I miss Adrian...

Edit: Oh, wait, this *ISN'T* Northlane, duh. I thought they released an EP named Polaris. Anyway, I actually liked this quite a bit, although the first two songs were kinda boring, IMO.
I've just always had a place in my heart for winter-themed armies so white it was! I do have big plans, this army is my one and only for 40k - currently working on 1000 points worth of models with plans and funds laid out for another 2500. Once I get all that built and painted I'm buying a titan, just not sure which one yet.
fuck, I thought it was code for a hug

Someone else mentioned her briefly, but want to throw in a word for Patricia C. Wrede. Her Enchanted Forest Chronicles, especially the first book Dealing with Dragons, are excellent fun. She also collaborated on Sorcery and Cecelia and sequels with Caroline Stevemer, of which the first one (all I've read) I found to be a total delight--a regency-era Fantasy told entirely in letters. 

Good luck with the reading challenge! I've never done a full year challenge of the sort but I've done No White Dudes for bingo and have found it enormously rewarding. The universe of books seems to paradoxically expand once you deliberately look past the most commonly-recommended sure authors.

So much this. I was told to get off my ivory tower for using full sentences in an email chain. At work. I wasn't correcting or making fun of anyone, I simply don't use letters to represent words and used punctuation. But you know what? If that's what it takes to live up in an ivory tower, count me in. What is the point of educating oneself just to dumb down the language, then struggle to remember the rules when it's needed? Just use them! 

God forbid someone think you're educated **especially** if you *paid* to be educated!
Yeah. I haven't gotten one yet in this phone. Probably should get one very soon though.

I mean, I'll admit it was a mess, but I loved the Jedi Knight series, and it sucks that Kyle Katarn isn't canon.
I just got one the other day (some say Calicase on Amazon are the same, but I wanted the blue one). The cutouts are the same as my previous case, which didn't cause any issues.
Yep.
I cannot say for others but personally, my experience has been that such scenario is similar to any regular games when playing next to huge blobs. Unless you have made your older blob too strong and solid to be broken, it can be done with some effort and tricks.

**Castlevania: Order of Ecclessia** Even with all that indie Metroidvania boom, I'm still finding myself returning to old 2D Castlevania games. Glad I did that because Order of Ecclesia is a damn good game. At first I didn't like some of the new ideas like overworld map but after a while got warmed to them. The game is also gorgeous for a DS game with beautiful animations and sprites. I feel people interested in Metroidvania platformers should definitely give DS Castlevania games a chance since even today they still remain among the best of the genre. Shame Konami is not making them anymore. R.I.P. Castlevania.

**Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright** Not enjoyed it as much as I expected. It feels more like DLC to the Awakening than a proper new entry to be honest. Lots of shoehorned and fanservice elements like marriages, children, sauna and house invitation stuff. Also found the castle feature pretty pointless. As positives the cinematics look great as before, the cast is decent with good support conversations and anime artwork is nice. Balance is also way better compared to Awakening so there are less ways to break the game and trivialise it. That said, I forced myself to finish the last couple of missions. I was planning to play Conquest after finishing Birthright but at this point I feel a bit burned out. Will still give it a chance later on.

**Heartstone** Ever asked yourself what happens when a Legend rank, 6-7 Arena win average Beta-Naxx Heartstone player returns to the game? The answer is he gets destroyed. It was so brutal at start that I burnt all of my gold amounting to 3K in Arena in a very rapid fashion accompanied by rage-inducing BM from my opponents. Fortunately I got the hang of Arena meta with the help of that stupid addon called Heartarena and climbed to 5.0 winrate including free wins of late. Managed to craft two competitive meta decks and tried my chances in ranked as well but I gave up  after I realized it's gonna be a long grind to legend for nothing at all really. All in all I already started to lose interest in the game again since I realised what made me quit the game at the time of Naxx is still present.

**Heartstone Rant** First, Arena is completely unbalanced since some classes like Mage have better chances of building functional good decks on top of having a OP hero power for Arena. Aside from that sometimes RNG screws you so hard at drafting phase that you are forced to play a curve/tempo/minion deck without spells, combos, synergy etc. Those decks can win games of course but they are so boring to play that they sap the life out of me. This applies to ranked and other modes as well but I feel the amount of RNG in this game became just ridicilous especially with the addition of discovery and other RNG mechanics. From what I can gather, Blizzard increases RNG elements to make their games more casual friendly and prevent the gap between hardcore and casual players becoming too large (they pulled a similar trick in WoW with RNG legendaries and forges). Their approach is probably genius from business side of things but doubt same thing can be said when it comes to game design. Last of all, I think the game is still too stingy when it comes to rewards and its business model. It's a F2P game but only if you try really hard (you are better off working and spending real money instead of trying to earn valuables in game). I feel their approach is just scumbaggy because you don't necessarily need to starve players to make money since the majority of the income will come from whales and they are luxury spenders so they will spend their money whether they are starved or not.
Huge K right there.
Okay, goddammit that was funny.
Had a smaller dog, Cocker Spaniel mix, about that size, who kept getting out of the back yard and chasing the mailman. When I would go to put her back in, the gate would always be open. First couple of time I just figured someone had not latched the gate, but she kept doing this everyday for about a week. 

I finally watched out the window when I knew the mailman was coming. What she was doing was, reaching up and flipping the latch open with her nose, then reaching into the chainlink gate with her paw and pulling the gate open. I had to put a damn rubber strap on the gate so she couldn't get out.
I'm going, but to be honest the whole process sounds like a huge pain in the ass. I just want to go, listen to someone talk, and vote. I have zero interest in debating with people.

Okay, so ignoring that haven already has a VERY GOOD 2 COST REMOVAL in blackened scripture, how about comparing her to other 2 drop followers? You know, like what we were talking about before you tried to weasel this comment chain into removal. 

IF blazing breath or zombie party enabled a 2/4 ward the following turn, maybe you'd have a leg to stand on. But they don't. Your logic is like minerals to chocolate granola bits.

Oh no, she can't trade into 2 drops and survive! Oh wait. she *does* trade into all the 1/2's in your list, AND leaves a 2/2 body behind. The other vanilla 2/2's she can't trade favorably into without using either her last word or an evo point... but she *can* trade evenly into most 3 drops anyway, so its a moot point. 

Such woe that a legendary card can be played around!

Last time was when I was in school. As soon as I went to college I was told to go on a first name basis by the teachers and then in uni I never spoke to my lecturers. 

So yeah, never. Unless they're actually a sir and I've yet to meet anyone with that title.
I love that wouldn't corrected to workstation.
My experience as well...things creased and faded really fast. I got lingerie lover, glitz factor (fave), no faux, wild nights and 2 others I can't remember off-hand, one was a dark purple with some sparkle and the other was too pale for my skin tone (wish I can get a diff one).

I find they are gorgeous swatched and okay on the lid, kind of difficult to apply with a brush but doesn't last for shit. With or without primer. 

I did find that it helped when I put primer potion, then a nude shade base on my lid from urban decay and then used them. It seemed to last better with that as a base. Still didn't last long as other shadows on me though.
Beautiful picture
Our house is very well insulated and has relatively new windows. I'm hesitant to accuse anything but I do have a theory going that our hallway (motion sensor lights) that all tenants use is on our meter and the basement, which has the washer and dryer. We've been calling national grid to come check it out and sent a very kind letter to our property manager but it also explains the increase when we reduced our usage. The first month we were here no one lived on the second floor. Then someone moved in which increases the foot traffic in the hallway AND they use the coin ops in the basement, which we never did. I wish they'd call us back.
It's an amazing song but if I throw that on, no matter what mood I'm in, I'm suddenly gonna see every woman I've ever loved and I just can't handle that.

I have no moral problems with porn. However, there is lots of evidence to that says porn is bad for brains of young men and women. It causes serious issues with cognitive development and can lead to lots of mental health issues.

I guess full-time roles for women in some organisations are going to have to be split into part-time roles to get the numbers up.  The only way you're getting more women into areas like manufacturing is if you have as many secretaries and PAs as you do operators and maintenance staff... see how long that company stays in business.

He drove me crazy how Shapiro would address something that Cenk would say, methodically hit his points why Cenk was wrong, and Cenk would then, in response to Shapiro's argument, drift off into another argument without properly attacking Shapiro's positions. He was frustratingly consistent in making pathos based arguments (wouldn't it be a great nation if we all had free healthcare?) but was unable to attack Shapiro's positions on healthcare as (not a) right, or how this universal healthcare idea is just redistributionist at it's core. At one point he made an appeal to populism. He might as well be Donald Trump for how poorly he debated.
NO ALCOHOL WITH EXERCISE.  NO ALCOHOL WITH EXERCISE.

Watch / listen / observe any kind of training for a competitive sport.  The first thing out of any coach's mouth is NO ALCOHOL.

Alcohol is a poison.  Your liver is responsible for removing poisons from your bloodstream.  It also regulates vitamin production, protein metabolism, clotting, on and on.  You put alcohol in there, it will abandon all other activity in favor of clearing out the alcohol.  Your liver could be weak, or your liver could be overloaded.  But either way, it's sending VERY CLEAR SIGNALS:  NO ALCOHOL WITH EXERCISE.

Pretty much anything that makes it different to sf4 or whatever game they used to play. I can see people complaining they have to learn 3 characters, high damage of climaxes, the different neutral or the different jump arcs. Technically KoF has stuff like jab anti airs as well, though it's an intended anti air method in the game, but can easily see people complaining about it anyway.

We had corn on the cob during a summer when my friend from France came to visit 
(I'd been her corrés when I was 15, but got sick at 16 so she couldn't stay with me the following year when she came to the US, so she came to visit during the summer when I was 17) 

She was so confused, because apparently corn on the cob is only a food for farm animals, and any corn they ate was canned or frozen kernels. 
She loved it though. Kind of have to have fresh summertime corn on the cob when in Illinois! 

She also was weirded out by the water. She's from Grenoble, one of the few cities in the French Alps that has basically mountain spring water from their taps. It's amazing. 
She mentioned how odd our tap water was and that it smelled strange. Apparently the fluoride tasted weird along with the small amounts of sulfur making it smell. This is Lake Michigan water, it's some of the best tap water in the Midwest. 

Something I've noticed since I moved to rural Alaska, my fiancé was raised within a community where the second language is Alaskan Yup'ik. So he'll say a word and I'll be confused, and only then does he realize that that particular word is actually a Yup'ik word and not an English one. Pretty neat actually. We always say 'Kenkamken' as it means 'I love you' in Yup'ik. 
Some words he didn't know weren't English; Nuq (basically poop) amuq (boob) stooks (claws) balalook (maggot) balook (type of tree fungus) 
Of course I wrote them all phonetically as I'm not sure the correct spelling. I've been told that there isn't much of a written record of Yup'ik as it's one of those languages that's passed down orally, so it's often written phonetically afaik.

This one time we are out at a KTV with some girls, all is good. Then somebody decides we need to change to another KTV, where more friends have more girls.

So we change. True that, more girls already picked. I get a girl. She's 18. At least she says she's 18, whatever.

And she wouldn't shut up about me dating and marrying her from the start. I tell the bitch I have a R****. Doesn't buy it - wanna marry still.

So I just proceed to drink with guys. Wtf bitch, you are paid to entertain, not to talk marriages.

I was burnt pretty badly with the over adherence to the formula in Commander 2016 (where I predicted legal nephilim generals), this being a 4 deck set alone breaks a lot of convention. The 3 commander options is likely going to be maintained but I really can't see them only have 8 new legendary creatures unless they're running out of ideas. Hell 8 is pretty close to the average for a large standard set.
Clinton statistically has the best chance at being the next president. She has a substantial amount of money in her campaign and frankly her polling numbers are much higher than Bernie Sanders. It's unlikely that a Republican will win with the shitshow of candidates they have and the damage that Trump has done to their party with his rhetoric.

The top clubs here would probably pass for a lower mid table side  in the championship.
I actually did not, I know little about Classic Who. Well I concede my point then.

Okay, so from what I remember War Doctor activates a weapon (also Bad Wolf is there) that somehow gets him, 10 and 11 together. Shenanigans happen, then these 3 and previous Doctors help save Gallifrey (including Capaldi). After they save the planet and return to that museum, someone says something about after they split up no one will remember, for some reason. Now I don't remember the particular reason, I think something about timelines being out of sync, but my issue was with how they explained why War Doctor and 10 (and subsequently all previous iterations) don't remember any of this seemed kinda weak. It's a minor issue really, but the did need a reason to not remember so alright then.

Hmmmm. That's true, especially since they want out later.

All I'm really saying is the number of regenerations helped focus where they would want to end the show. Without a number anymore, it's the wild west.

It won't keep me from trying it, I'm just saying it sounds kinda like a running out of ideas kinda thing. Or "Hey this sounds cool, let's just do it cause the Doctor is quirky". But context is important and you gave some, so now my mind has been somewhat changed.

I'll give it a shot in the near future

If it's an original rt or pro the kickstand will only have one position, so see if it just happens to be clicked back further on any pictures. That would narrow it down to a gen 2. The rts are much slimmer than their pro counterparts, the pros are about twice as thick. Pretty much all surface 2's are silver, pretty much all of the older pros and original rts are black. I'm also pretty sure that the rt units had mini HDMI ports, whereas the pros had mini display instead.

Someone could probably narrow it down if you could post a link to the pictures?

Couldn't tell ya. In a similar vein, if there's nothing to any of this speculation, then why doesn't the Trump administration support an independent investigation? That would keep it from becoming a partisan witch hunt and would exonerate him. And why have they lied so often about their interactions with Russia?

&gt;They only allowed the one private sector company

An arrangement the FBI agreed to, by the way.
So we're to conclude that, dealing with a highly vocal trans activist, constantly talking about trans issues, who looks distinctly like she's not biologically female, and has a visible Adam's apple, there's a reasonable likelihood that she has a rare medical condition and the rest is purely coincidence?  While that would be a theoretical ideal of openminded rationality, people simply don't WORK that way.

Consequently, I don't think it was Milo's intent to out anyone when he wrote that piece, I think he just believed he was discussing something people already knew was the case.  In fact his article writes extensively about Brianna's past disastrous involvement in online transgender communities, and quotes statements she had made in 2007 publicly referring to herself as transsexual.  Ergo, Milo did not out her, she was already out, Milo simply connected her to past actions.  I do not believe that a person online somehow has the right to be publicly out, reinvent themselves under a new online persona, then accuse someone of having outed them simply by connecting their current online activities to their real, out, identity.  As I said before, this can be argued to be doxxing, but it's not outing.

I will not deny that Milo wrote a hitpiece pandering to the schadenfreude of certain sections of GamerGate to see a bitter enemy taken down a peg, I won't deny there are ethical issues, but there are also justifications in that Brianna is a flagrantly dishonest bad actor, at least in the opinions of most GGers and frankly even a lot of antis who are sick of her crap, and exposes on the chicanery of dishonest individuals are hardly new, or inherently unethical.  That said, I find Milo's attitudes on transgender people deplorable and the focus of his article on irrelevant information meant to embarrass rather than discredit her.  You might be surprised how many GGers think as I do, Milo is quite polarizing within GG circles, he's not nearly as universally loved as antis seem to believe.

So yes, he did a bad thing, and yes, many GGers, some out of bigotry, some out of anger or spite, cheered him on as he did it.  But it wasn't SO BAD that I'm willing to condemn the whole movement over it, just encourage my peers to be bigger people in the future, listen to the angels on our shoulders, not the bleached-blonde devils.

Haven't tried it that recently, but I could not get as close to the sensors without losing tracking as I can with the Vive when I tried it.  I also find the requirement for more than two sensors, and the requirement for USB connection from sensor to PC place a lot of limitation on room set-up options.  I'm not saying you can't get a decent experience with Constellation tracking, just that Lighthouse is pretty inarguably better in every way (range/accuracy/simplicity).

This is what a lot of Bernie supporters miss. They're not actually interested in politics so much as they are in the man himself. Elections usually aren't this exciting, so the minute Bernie loses the nomination or (inevitably) the general election, they'll be angry for a few weeks before forgetting about the whole thing, his message, and "Political Revolution"; making the whole ordeal worthless. As someone who works in local politics and is helping the democrats prepare for the General, I applaud your activity in politics, even if I may not necessarily agree with your positions. We need more people, young people especially, to take a vested interest in the political process of the country on both a national and local level, even if it is merely voting.

He mixed his thoughts together into something worse than he meant. Started with the story of his childhood and tried to make it into a witty joke about the priest raping him. Then was talking on the serious subject of young men (he used the term boys at the time but gad meant guys in their 20s) should form a relationship with an older man if they are gay. To have the older gay pass down their knowledge to a younger gay man. Problem is of course that he did both of these in the same speech and people naturally thought he meant gay children should seek out older men and tgat he was promoting that relationship.

Best leave that one in the desert.
I was also fucked up by this movie pretty bad too. That scene with the lion creeping in the shadows then attacking while the kids were in the attic...*fuck* that did some damage to my psyche. 

Since seeing that scene, I was 100% convinced there was a magical lion hiding in my bathtub, but only when the shower curtains were closed. Before I could sit down to pee I would *have to* open the curtains to see if the damn lion was in there. I also always wanted them opened so I didn't have to be locked in a closed space (the bathroom w door shut) if it so happened that the lion was there. My mom was so frustrated with me for this, because to her the bathroom looked really messy and unkept with the shower curtains opened. Many arguments were had over this...

Anyone who sits around the Discord knows what I'm about to say. SunnyB has gotta get the axe...he's just not good enough in my opinion, the team can pick up a better player than him. Because of Tommey's versatility though, they can really look at anyone.

I'd love to see someone like Wailers come in personally, with Tommey running a more aggressive role to basically fill Sunny's spot. The team as a whole would slow down somewhat, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

&gt; 10% of profits were returned to shareholders in 1970; this figure is now 70%. 

Ideally you should not blindly throw around figures, especially those that come from political advocacy organizations like OxFam, without understanding what they mean. The claim you're citing is that at some point in the past, on average UK corporations in all industries returned 10% of profits to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, and that now that figure is 70%.

There are at least three problems with your use of that claim to debunk the aforementioned investor's complaint. First, the investor was talking about the US airline industry, not UK corporations in general. You have no idea whether the same is true in the US airline industry.

More importantly, the OxFam claim is about what happens to profits, and the investor is complaining that profits will be low. Even if 70% of profits are returned as dividends, 70% of a very small profit could reasonably be called "leftovers," e.g. if labor gets 30% of revenues and investors get 2%.

Finally, in general investors don't necessarily care that much about dividends vs. reinvested earnings. If a corporation can reinvest earnings profitably, in a way that causes the company to grow and increases its stock price, that's still good for investors, because they have the option to sell the stock for capital gains. Usually, dividends and buybacks are only in investors' interest when the corporation cannot profitably reinvest all of its profits.

I have no idea whether the investor's complaint is valid, but the statistic you cited certainly doesn't prove that it isn't.

I hit the same problem as you. I had mistakenly changed the index attribute for a bunch of files and noticed some strange behavior with Windows search after. Not sure if it's related, however, I was able to fix the problem by toggling the "allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties property on the C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData folder (I just did the entire dir).

Ultimately I set it so that the option was checked/enabled for the AppData folder and that fixed the issue for me (note: mine was already enabled, so I just toggled it, not sure what the attribute is set to in the default install).

EDIT: note I toggled the attribute for all sub files/folders when asked. Not sure why this fixed the problem for me, but it seems like there might be some bug with search links / indexing
Seems like a cheap way to win the fight but we'll try that the next time we run the instance - if the fight doesn't work properly in the first place, then people need to come up with creative ways to cheese it.

1. Nothing priebus said looks close to abolishing it. 

2. Saying an amendment = abolition is flat out wrong. 

3. Libel laws should be expanded. There should be a small fine for first time offenders that ramps up after that. If you post legitimate fake news, like saying the president pissed on someone with no actual corroborating evidence, there should be some sort of penalty. This is how we've gotten these terrible news networks, on both sides, by allowing people to not have to do actual research and reporting on stories that may or may not have even happened. 

4. Saying expansion of libel laws is equivalent to abolishing the first amendment is fundamentally wrong, as the right to free speech isn't the only right enumerated in the first amendment. 

5. If libel laws are expanded, it isn't an abolition because trump wouldn't be suing from the government, legally speaking, he'd be suing as a citizen. Now, if he changes it to say he's using the government to sue, I'll be right with you, but he's not, and as of now he can't.

&gt; So when such a clueless guy runs into a transparent slut (or just a woman who is very vocal about wanting sex), odds are that he'll assume that she's far less selective than what actually is the case. It basically goes like this: "hey, she puts out easily, so it should be a piece of cake to get laid with her".

Holy fuck, this makes too much sense. Far too much.

It reminds me of a night out recently with two of my friends. There was no woman with us, but the basic clueless beta thinking behind what you describe was the same.

So I was out having drinks with my non-clueless beta incel friend A and the most clueless Gutmensch incel guy I know, I think I need to give him a name ...Ben.

A was talking about his job and I asked him: "By the way, does Chad still work there? And does he still hit on all the female coworkers?" One of my ex-girlfriends had worked at the company for some time over 10 years ago and she always talked about how Chad was hitting on every single one of his coworkers. I actually met him. Good looking, masculine, but unintelligent and unlikable on first sight. Picture a professional fake-tan Ballermann Schlagersinger. 

A said: "Yes, he is still working there and coincidentally, we have a new really pretty 22yo college-educated intern. I like her, she is intelligent and nice...and now she is together with Chad."

Me: "Wtf? He must be 40+ right now? Chad and a college student? Really?

A: "Yes, I can't understand it."  

We described Chad to Ben and his eyes lit up: "Isn't that GREAT?! If such a dork can get a pretty intelligent nice young girlfriend, it means that it must be ridiculously easy for nice guys like us!!"

A and I tablepalmed and I said: "No, Ben. No. This is the *opposite* of what it actually means."

Ben: "But...but...but"
Cool. Thanks

From experience, you can do pretty much most, if not all your tests at a polyclinic for a pretty hefty discount compared to a GP. Usually those tests with a ridiculous mark-up are the ones from executive health screening programmes.

They had a thanks post up of their wife.. and my brain thought that meant he was a girl, and girls are called mommy.
Yeah, who needs tournaments?
I wear a 34 inch waist partly because of my quads and ass by that measurement at 5'8 I should consider my health. Again on a macro level sure this a great tool. But when you take it to the level of individual their doctor is a much better indicator of health than a fucking measurement. I think even the people who did the studies referenced would agree with that.
Just a despicable person and  setting a horrible example for her poor children. It's people like her that provide the excuse that racists need to justify their hate. She's so stupid, that she thinks that documenting what a self-entitled, angry hag she is is a good idea.

The NHS is pretty fantastic. The UK government spends 60% per capita on healthcare compared to the US government, and provides universal coverage for everybody. There is also a thriving private market with insurance competition, insurance from your job etc.

Yes.  When the sentence is over, it's over.  That's the punishment.  Even when in prison, they are still a citizen.
This is an awesome post.  What you are preaching is the best lesson I ever learned.  It took me a really long time to learn it but man is it true.  I thought I was mourning the person he was at the beginning of the relationship.  When I finally figured out that he never was that person in the first place it set me free.  Thanks for sharing.
Yes the signs are my worry. While most speak English, most are also rude. But i have Google translate and Google maps so i think I'll survive

EDIT: The point being, that's my metric for happiness when I want to evaluate how happy I am in life.

I should have mentioned that my experience with these is explicitly for software.  And I may be biased because it's very frustrating to throw away work based on a 7 year old patent that didn't get developed by anyone else.

I would bet that a &amp; c are not true, b may be.

&gt; it just means they need further improvements.  

On that we can agree :)  I just happen to think that they're doing more harm than good in their current state.  If I make an idea, and someone can do it better, then the general public deserves to benefit from that product (albeit, at my expense).
Excellent contribution. Five stars. Thanks for the info.

&gt; Da sich dein Spitzensteuersatz verringert brauchst du wahrscheinlich weniger als 10% zu ersetzen.

Hab mir das von meiner Gehaltsstelle schon mal kursorisch ausrechnen lassen, was genau Netto vom Brutto bliebe, so dass ich schon genau weiß, welchen Betrag ich abpuffern muss. Aber die ESt-Erklärung wird sich dann wegen der "Günstigerprüfung" für mich auch positiv auswirken, so dass ich mir da ein bisschen was zurückholen werde können. 

&gt; Das größte Risiko ist das Sequence-of-Return-Risiko. D.h. wenn du Aktien verkaufen musst, weil du Geld brauchst und die Aktien gerade unten sind. Wenn das am Anfang passiert, hat das die größten Auswirkungen.

Ja, davon hab ich auch schon gelesen, dass bei der SWR die ersten 10 Jahre den größten Schaden am Portfolio anrichten können. Auch die SWR ist halt nicht in allen Marktmodellen ein totsicheres Modell, zumindest jedenfalls dann nicht, wenn man partout 4% pro Jahr abgreifen will. Und nach dem jahrelangen Aufschwung, den wir bereits hinter uns haben, dürfte eine Rezession in den nächsten 10 Jahren ziemlich wahrscheinlich sein. Aber wer weiß das schon genau. 

Ich selbst bin eher ein Freund der Dividenden, denke aber jetzt auch über einen Mix aus Ausschüttern und Thesaurierern nach: Die Ausschütter für's jetzt benötigte Zubrot, die Thesaurierer würde ich erst dann anfassen, wenn ich mit 67 in den gesetzl. Ruhestand gehe. Bis dahin sind's noch 17 Jahre (außer das Eintrittsalter ändert sich bis dahin noch fünfmal), das würde den Thesaurierern genug Zeit geben, sich weiter zu entwickeln... 17 Jahre Vorlauf wären genug Zeit, um Aktien-ETFs den Vorzug zu geben vor - zumindest zur Zeit - miserablen Zinsen auf Sparprodukte. UND ich hätte das Geld zugleich für einen Notfall trotzdem jederzeit griffbereit, bliebe also flexibel. Denn was die Zukunft bringt - an der Börse wie persönlich -, weiß ja keiner von uns.
Both went unsuccessful.

Think we might have something lost in translation, tbh. Do your buses go various different routes? Does bus A go straight-left-straight-left-straight-right and bus B go straight-left-straight-left, starting at or intersecting at different bus stops, or the like? We have buses that go N-&gt;S, S-&gt;N, E-&gt;W, W-&gt;E. Buses don't make weird turns(I mean at intersections, obviously the bus follows a curved street :p) *usually*. Sometimes there will be the main bus line that goes from point A to B and stops along the way, but there might be a second bus on the same street that goes from point A to A and a half then start going a different direction along another part of the city, but they're rare. The routes are generally intuitive, usually straight.

Very cool. I wish I had a GBC with an SP light in it.
In my high school me and my friends were in gym when people started running out to the hallway. We ran out with them and saw 2 seniors going ham on each other, and of course because of that there was a sea of children surrounding them. It started normal but then the one guys girl friend came out to stop it and immediately got socked in the face and was knocked out. One teacher got sucker punched and by the time he got up there were 3 more teachers running down the hallway going to stop the fight. Then out of no where one of the kids pulls a knife from his backpack. Luckily before he got to do anything he got tackled. After the fight I was talking to one of the kids friends and he said "Oh ya they were fighting because NAME said he was better at football, and then NAME 2 got angry." I was dumbfounded when he said this... pulling a knife... over football... what the hell.

people overhype how much confidence turns on girls. if you're attractive you can be shy and they don't give a fuck, they will think its cute. if you're ugly, your "confidence" wont tip the scales. they'd rather fuck a hot awkward dude.

the REAL advice is, work out, get fuckn ripped. girls will fuck a guy with an average or slightly ugly face, if he has a mad body. just like i'd fuck a girl with a fuckin hot as hell body if her face was a little beat, its no big deal.

But why?  Developers take funding to offset development risk, so I don't see why that's an issue.  The alternative is to argue that developers should limit their funding and/or absorb more of the business risk.  Which in some cases may mean no development to begin with.

Really not seeing the argument here...
It isn't an urban myth, it just takes more than a few chocolate bars to actually cause damage.
may I present a dissenting opinion? I would recommend the SP3.

For one, you will get better specs for your money. $699 at the Microsoft store will get you the top of the line SP3 but not even the sp4 with m3 and 128G of storage (it is $749). 

Moreover, I think the SP3 is a better machine. I don't disagree that the SP4 improved the thermals, but nearly every SP4 review says that it has about an hour or hour and a half LESS battery life than the SP3. This is for two reasons: the screen is larger and higher resolution, and they actually shrank the battery (!) to make it thinner.

Moreover, the "better keyboard" is fully compatible with the SP3. I am typing this on an SP3 right now using the "SP4" keyboard with fingerprint reader (which I much prefer to the unreliable face-detection camera on the SP4). 

Maybe if you are an artiste who needs the very best resolution possible then you should go for the SP4 but otherwise SP3 is in my opinion a better choice. I have both SP3 and SP4 but never use the latter. It was also incredibly buggy at launch (mostly addressed). I have also owned SP1, SP2, S2, S3, and SB.

Lastly, if you can buy SP3 refurbished from MS Store do that. I got mine on Amazon because I did not know that MS was selling them, but that would absolutely be a better option. In fact, knowing that now I may return this unit and get one from the MS store, if only so they will process the warranty and possibly sell me MS Complete.

Good luck to you.

&gt;Well, I'm no historian 

Yeah clearly from what you wrote so far.

&gt;but from what I do know, the Japanese were already engaged with China and they needed more oil to continue the fight, otherwise the Chinese would counter attack. The Chinese had been dickish to Japan for like a century prior and now that the Japanese "modernized" they had the military capacity to expand. 

Oh yeah right. Please tell me how 19th century china was dickish to Japan when that was china's century of humiliation? You know the century where European colonialism was humiliating china with all the wars they lost to Europeans, ports they lost and had to "lease", trading zones, etc.

This news article is either poorly-written or I have terrible reading comprehension skills. The thread and article title says "full ride" to Harvard and then in the text of the article it says, "In addition to the $10,000 scholarship..." Wouldn't $10,000 pay for only a few months' tuition? I know Harvard and some other schools waive tuition if your household income is below a certain threshold.

If you plan on having root for Lollipop, use [Sunshine](http://theroot.ninja/) to unlock your bootloader while you're still on 4.4.2, otherwise it may not be possible, or more difficult, to gain root once you've upgraded. Once you've done so, you can go about upgrading to a newer version, unless you don't care about keeping root. As for the stock recovery image, the one for 4.4.4 is available [HERE](http://www.filefactory.com/file/17tvxl6b90d5/XT1049_GHOST_REPW_4.4.4_KXA21.12-L2.7.2_cid6_CFC.xml.zip). That's the full 4.4.4 stock rom for Republic Wireless, I think flashing the recovery image from that zip should allow you to be able to take OTA updates.

After being treated like shit by this game for most of last year I finally took a nice break following the disastrous x4 GFE new year's crap. So I barely played at all this month, wasted lots of stamina because I started a different game, regularly checked in, did random shit but not really giving PAD much attention. Saved 35 stones and figured WTH, I really don't care anymore. 

**Arcline**, a decent start but surprisingly the only time the light gala interfered, after taking massive dumps on me most of last year. 

**Alrescha**, oh you're new, an actual featured unit, first time I got that in about 6 months. 

**Sharon**, oh the water wizard, got the red one too, just need your green friend to complete the set. 

**Freyr**, well aren't you a surprise, already got your sister so now you 2 can have a reunion. 

**Rodin**, finally, could have used you a long time ago buddy but welcome nonetheless. 

**Satsuki #4**, there's my shit luck, still on the fence about selling the 3rd, certainly don't need a 4th, sold. 

I think i'm done here. Wait...the GF description says increased rates for Kali's? Screw it, last 5 stones, not like i'll actually get DKali though, not with my luck. 
Final roll was indeed, **DKali**. O__o

It's like this game knows I stopped paying much attention to it and is trying to win me back by giving me stuff. :P

I'm really happy to see a real modder give out his/her opinion about this. I rarely code and even I know that updates break things, it's a law of programming nature.

Have you tried the Pro Bleed Kit? Much better at actually getting all the air out, just make sure you don't pull so hard you pull air in from the lever piston... For pads, make sure your running sintered (metal) pads. Organics will have more initial bit, but less overall power and they wear _very_ fast.

After riding Elixir 5s for a while, and trying friends' bikes with Shimanos (new and last gen XT mostly), I would say avoid Shimano if you like the Elixir feel. The XTs are very strong, but modulation is more difficult, they're very on/off compared to Avids.

Perhaps try the mid range SRAM Guides,  or treat yourself (it's brakes, they're quite important) and go with Hope. The new Tech 3 lever has great modulation, very Avid like, and the new E4 caliper is quite powerful. And they're simple to bleed, it's like a car or motorcycle: open cap, fill reservoir, open bleed screw, squeeze lever, close bleeder, release lever, repeat until fluid is clean and/or no bubbles, done!
Ironically my hatred for Communism besides listening to stories from my father in South America was reading about communism and what communism did to innocent people.

Know and protect your weak spacings in the ground game, and if they get exposed know how to respond accordingly.  Air to air with jump back/neutral jump or using forward dash to dash underneath are effective tools in avoiding your bad AA spacings if you can't control that spacing on the ground.

Sure, there are always exceptions. But for the majority of cases out there in most disciplines, if someone wants to be competitive right out of the PhD, they need to have a strong ass CV with some solid pubs. I know this becomes less important the lower tier one goes, but for research universities this is overwhelmingly the case.
We are a family of five, with three children 8,7,5.  We have lived in Denver for two years now and I would really like to spend some time up in the mountains.  I'm looking for advice on where we might camp, or a great hotel to stay at.  We have a tent and everything we need and would love to do some "roughing it" kinda camping.  In contrast to that we would love to stay a couple of nights at a really nice place where we can hike and swim up in the mountains. I would also like to keep the drive under or around 3 hours cuz, well I did say I have three kids right?  Thanks for any advice!

Invest in ship in both GW and Fleet until you can do the challenge, then only grab the Fleet only ships you want and use the rest for characters or zetas (depending on what you need more at the time).

Getting the fleet challenge going ASAP is important as any zetas you get there are essentially free from that point on.

Again, the show isn't about Batman's origin story, it's about Gotham City decaying.

Bruce isn't the main character, try to stop thinking of Gotham as a "Hero's Story" / "Coming of Age" narrative and more of a pulp crime story, which is what it actually is.
you learn that you can't hold one persons actions against everyone else.  Its not fair to you or others.  Its a terrible thing but you'll lose out on lots if you let 1 person impact your entire life.   I should also mention it takes some time to be ready to do this

So then your original comment of "The NVA only started gaining ground after the US left South Vietnam to die" is incorrect considering the NVA were inflicting *more* casualties on us after Tet than before. We left Vietnam because the war was escalating, not because it "looked bad on TV."

I would say about 80% white. Indian and Asian make up 15%, and the 5% is black. This is an upper-middle class high school in a suburb.

Officially no, but I personally feel many of them would have stuck around longer if they in heavier.  Reaching a point of emaciation puts an added stress on everything. Had Larry began with an extra 10lbs of fat hanging on him, I think have gone another week. I'd be curious to know which of them actually lost the most body weight.

None of the tap outs on season 2 were officially because of starvation. Dave probably would have won regardless, as I think he would have stayed 'till they medically evacuated him. Also looked as if his weight balanced out towards the end (though that would have probably changed come winter). 

Jose in particular always left me wondering. I feel like he may have felt more optimistic about beating hypothermia if he had, say, 10lbs of extra fat on him. That guy went in relatively light and left on the cusp of emaciation.

I feel the same about Callie in season 3. She decided to leave on her own terms, tapping out before getting to a place of desperation. I wonder if she would have felt like going longer if she began fat rather than relatively thin.

Again, though, that's all speculation. Dave and Fowler won the contests they were competing in, not the hypothetical contests they weren't.
This is outrageous. It's unfair!
Five feet of fury, excuse you.
I will give her credit for admitting she made the mistake.
Well I know that, I gave up on life a long time ago.
I have super oily skin and this is my favorite in the mornings when I shower to get the oily gunk off my face after a night's sleep. It doesn't get my makeup remover/oil cleanser (currently a homemade mix of Albolene and Cromollient SCE) off so I can't really use it for a double cleanse, but it's perfect when I don't have to remove makeup and I want something gentle.

Bad writing: 

- FF5, the characters and story were bland and forgettable, especially the villain Exdeath.

- FF8, the story jumps the shark later on and does a horrible job rationalizing it. 

- Breath Of Fire 1, most of the characters besides maybe Nina didn't have much personality besides their unique appearances.

Good Writing:

- Grandia, like a lot of people who've played this say, the game has lovable characters while evoking the feeling of an epic adventure.

- Dragon Quest 8, some might say this is tropey, but I actually really enjoyed the character's personalities and the way they reacted off of each other, and I also enjoyed the way the story managed to balance lighthearted humor with dark and dramatic moments.

- Chrono Trigger, this is the game I feel did the best job fleshing out all the characters. Having the option to explore their backstories further as opposed to rushing it into the main game was genius.

- Mario And Luigi: Superstar Saga, still one of the funniest JRPGs I ever played.
Google Earth and Street View are both so fucking amazing and underated.

Ahh. My 770 is barely chugging along. For recent games, I have to download games on my 2nd SSD and then connect it to my brother's laptop with a 970m. Then I plug my HDMI, mouse, and KB to the laptop and play from there. I do this almost every day on my small desk. All because I returned my 1070 in december expecting Vega to release sooner. And then the miner craze......yadayada

I'm probably gonna get the i5/8gb/256 for $1399 from the official store as the discounts right now seem great. Although it would be nice to hear any update on the surface book 2.
Your life is only pointless if you don't decide you're going to do something with it. If you're sitting around waiting for someone else to provide the meaning to your life, then yes, it will be pointless. We will all eventually die. That doesn't mean we should quit living now.

The energy portion of my comments is completely unrelated to the travel ban. If you read my original post, I say that we should be looking at renewable sources of energy beyond oil. The biggest reason we support Saudi Arabia is because we depend on them for oil. Take away that dependency and our reasons for supporting them collapse. Does that make sense to you?

Welcome to Night Vale. I've heard it described as "A Prairie Home Companion meets The Twilight Zone," which is fairly accurate. It's a community radio show about a weird little town in the desert with strange people like John Peters (you know, the farmer), the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, and Khoshek, the floating cat in the station bathroom, to name a few. The episodes stand alone, but each season there's an overarching theme. It's incredibly well written with both hilarious and moving moments. 

"The past is gone, and cannot harm you anymore. And while the future is fast coming for you, it always flinches first and settles in as the gentle present."

And the voice of Night Vale, Cecil Baldwin, has the most amazing, beautiful, smooth radio voice. I would listen to him read the dictionary.
it's just a bunch of hot air.
Yeah, that's not right.  If I was a parent, that would super piss me off.
Bernie supporters are great.  When of campaigns, superpacs are scared, they'll do anything, like pretend to be Bernie supporters.  Almost always people follow the direction of a leader by their actions.  Bernie is polite and committed.  From what I see, so are his supporters.  Hillary is dedicated and wants to win at all costs, no matter what.  A few of her supporters might that really means win at all costs.
A lot of subs ban based on participation in "wrong think" subs.

Its also possible that because your post was popular that a "good citizen" quote mined your history and reported it to the proper central authority.


In either case that sub's existence is a perfect encapsulation with everything wrong with their ideology. Its almost poetic.

They are living proof of the failure of their ideology.
Wow, thanks for all the positive feedback, guys! It was truly a fun trailer to make. I loved the game so much and the official trailer gets me emotional every time. Nintendo's launch trailer was a **REEAAAAAAAAALLY** tough act to follow.  

I gotta give thanks to Audiomachine for allowing creators like me to use their (EPIC) music for personal projects like these. While I'm not making a cent out of it, the trailer wouldn't have been possible and would not have had the same feel, so they'll be getting all their deserved revenue. 

The work and time put in was well worth it knowing you guys enjoy it. Thanks again!

I was a gullible kid.

My grandfather loves Ford cars and hates Chevrolets. He used to tell me that anyone who rode in a Chevy would sink into the seats, never to be seen again.

One day my uncle came to the house and picked my grandfather up in his Chevy fan. Cue a five year old me in hysterics. I lost it. No one in my family could console me because I literally thought I've lost this man for life.

It wasn't until he came back home I realized it was all a lie. He still likes to tell this story at events and I'm 23

You may be to fragile to exist in the real world then. If you grow up with the internet and still can't take criticism on it, I'm not sure what to say.

Imo he got what he deserved in the end. I totally agree as a character he was fucking awesome but it makes 0 logical sense to even contemplate welcoming him back, which is why I wanted to bitch slap Ann when she tried to welcome him back.

You're trying way too hard, dude, when the explanation to the question you asked (why the downvotes) is really simple. You've even gotten the answer more than once; but seem to be reading more into it. But really, it boils down to people protecting what they want to see in the community. 

It very much is sad people feel the need to brigade TrollX, much less any sub, but it happens - and requires upkeep to deal with. Members here are inundated with bullshit elsewhere, it gets used as a retreat. So they made their own space to escape some of it. Every community has its own jargon, and a sense of what is and isn't acceptable. They have things they want to see and things they don't. Most guys that come here seem to get our deal. It doesn't make this community or its members broken to enforce that, it makes them people tired of bullshit. 

So yeah, maybe you should chill about the dude getting a few downvotes. Being that most of us don't obsess over post history, he's going to have lots of chances to earn more Internet points back based on each post he makes. And! he gets to be secure in the fact that even if people disagree with him here, trollx isn't the kind of place where its members doxx, harass or stalk you for it.
Because liberals hate America. They hate the idea of American exceptionalism. They believe that our success comes at the expense of other countries. This is how they view individual success too.

Find something to do that makes yourself genuinely proud, and that can't be compared to others. I like working out for that reason. Sure, you can always look at the most muscled guy in the gym, but making progress for yourself always feels really good, and after a while I started comparing myself to others in a positive way, as motivation instead of envy.

Pokemon GO is what made Twitch IRL, not social eating. The social eating was created to attract the Asian audiences (IRL has killed it) after they saw what cooking did in creative. The eating was suppose to be a strict activity; they literally wanted food (and not snacks) in front of you. If you remember, people like Ice would rush to go back to other sections when food was almost done in both those sections because they didn't know the full rules. Pokemon GO is what opened up activities.
 
The Ice_Poseidon pokemon go stuff that went viral is what convinced them to bring over IRL no doubt, as he had to keep getting clarifications on how long he would have to have gameplay up and that would interfere with the soon-to-come IRL action. He was in constant contact with twitch which sucks because they've used him as an experimental streamer for this whole thing and kind of tossed him aside as new streamers have come in.

I know that for me, one I leave my bf after a visit I always go through a rough readjustment to the distance and am really down. It's really difficult to get back into the swing of my old routine and I end up a little more distant from him because sometimes coping with the emotions that come along with separating are easier to deal with if  I don't talk to him constantly. Maybe she's just going through a normal period of readjusting to her life ( 5 weeks away is a long time). Although, talking a whole day to respond to a text is a bit odd, I'd definitely just be open and communicate with her why there's a sudden shift.

imo, they are good. I learnt somewhere that the highest rated CB should be in the middle for all odd def formations. Which you are using it now.

Maybe some expert players could verify the theory above.

Another thing is since you are using same league only boost players, try to keep the players from same league. This can increases your OVR 11.

Last summer I ordered a pizza from my favorite place one night.

I have one that's quite similar which [I just listed on /r/watchexchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/comments/43jooe/wts_vintage_bulova_surf_king_175/). I've had a tough time finding any information on mine, but it's similar to the late 50's Surf Kings- yours looks similar.

I think people get a little bent out of shape when they hear about "taken people" flirting.  It's not like sexuality ceases when you're in a committed relationship, and normal people can acknowledge the sexuality of others without it crossing a boundary within a relationship.  

My fiancee and I will flirt with others, especially our friends but with others as well, because *it's fun and makes everyone feel good*.  But yeah, you do have to be careful to draw the line and make sure the involved parties know there's a line.  

Dancing is a good example of this.  We go social dancing.  Dancing is flirtatious and fun - and it's fun to dance with lots of different partners.  It's fun to make your dance partner feel sexy - man or woman.  It's also fun to know that other people desire you, or will at least make you *feel* desired.  At the end of the day though you have to a) communicate and b) build trust so as not to leave someone feeling hurt.

How this was put into place is that when he contacted me about making plans with the kids, I suggested he work it out with them directly.  I worried I was putting them in the middle, but the therapists assured me it was empowering them, that they were going to have him as their father for the rest of their lives and they needed to figure out for themselves how to manage it.

When he complained to me, my lawyer told me to reply only with a stock phrase, something like, "I realize the current situation is frustrating for you.  I encourage you to work though this with the kids in therapy."  It pissed him off every time, but it shut him up.

I don't know how old your kids are, but that's what worked for our teens.

From what I know natives really don't like sharing their religion with other people they prefer to keep the knowledge hidden and only their tribes members to participate. Besides we don't know a lot about the natives Americans religions and their are multiple religions and mythology throughout the tribes, which one would you pick. It is an interesting idea though.

What about just adding those servers to your favorites and seeing the ping values in the server menu?
That is a way to calculate your ATDEE, your average. I said it was nearly impossible to calculate each day. 

How about distinguishing between a day where you deadlift and a day where you isolate minor muscle groups. Shouldn't you compensate accordingly for the greater amount of calories needed to repair your legs and back after squatting opposed to shoulders? If you eat the same on your light days wouldn't you gain more fat? Are we not trying to gain the least fat during a "lean bulk"?

Edit: The problem lies within how many days are you going to waste before figuring out you need more food to grow? Let's say your deadlift weight is down, was it a lack of sleep? Just a bad day? We can't just up our calories from one bad lifting day, we need more evidence. Deadlift day two rolls around, another bad day, ok now we know we need to up the calories. We add a hundred cals for our 3rd deadlift day this month, mind you we have wasted weeks now figuring out if we needed to up the calories. Personally, I dont  want to risk wasting 3/4 of a months lifts figuring out if my calories are high enough to grow. 

The guy eating to bulk is going to make a lot more gains.
I love it. Might actually make me use some of the cooler looking sprays rather than the cute, pixel and hearthstone emotes on every hero.
Umm yeah, my babe couldn't even roll over at 4 months.
1. Rent: Evidence of ability to pay rent, when and how they should transfer funds by.


2. Cleanliness/tidiness: Do you share similar expectations? Who will be responsible for what chores? How often?


3. If sharing facilities like bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, washing machine, etc.: Agree on schedules for when each of you are going to be using them.


4. Visitors: Agree on how often/how long/types of activities that are allowed.


5. Noise: Agree on when noise will be kept down, whether music is ok, etc.


6. Social: Will you be keeping to yourselves, or trying to be more like friends?

What are the chances of there being *another* Eugene Kusche attending a school near Manitowoc in the same graduating class as  *the* Eugene Kusche?  The name is not that common.  It's got to be him; he just started out skinny and beefed up over the years.

BTW, how the hell did you get a better image quality/resolution?
He also has another one for sale [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/182007980449) and it looks like the same user has the high bids on both currently.
I made a post around, I want to say April of last year, that ended up getting voted to the top. It was about how the way things were currently, I was absolutely not going to be buying another expansion.

At that time we'd had no living world episodes shipped and legendaries had just been put on an indefinite hold. We had a huge content drought prior to the expansion release (which I had kind of expected) and were in the middle of a huge content drought after it. I don't think I had mentioned it in the post, but I also had sworn off buying gems until I felt they earned more of my money.

Things sure do change, hm? I've seen the main leaks and given what I know, and what we've had in terms of content since living world started shipping, I'd have to say there's almost no chance I'm *not* buying it. You lost me for a while arenanet, but you've won me back. I'm looking forward excitedly to the reveal.

It's not, it's because stealing PPV's takes money directly out of fighters pockets and stops the growth of the sport. If you lot want to pirate things then that's up to you but we're not going to drive massive amounts of traffic to illegal sites that are taking money from the fighters.

Sadly, I agree. I don't think YouTube will harbor the same crowds as Twitch. Twitch had the first move advantage and now it's garnered WAY more attention than YouTube ever imagined. I don't think YouTube can compete unless it offered streamers a WAY more competitive percentage for subs/etc. Until then, Twitch will dominate the market.

What is better in term of profits :

- a) Intel lose 10% market share, and keep price the same
- b) Intel lower price by 10%, to retain 100% market share

a) is the most profitable option for Intel... B) if much worse, and is even worse if the price cut doesn't result in keeping 100% of its market share.

For Intel to sacrifice margin / profit, AMD will need to take a massive amount of market share.
And to be clear, AMD also want to avoid a price war. 

edit: to be clear Intel has ZERO financial incentive to lower prices to keep a few % of market share. lowering prices to do so it financial suicide.  But if AMD capture well over 20%, it then become a viable option. And we are far from that.

The "match" itself was fine so far.  I don't see why they feel the need to make a jarring cut back to the rest of the PPV "mid-match" though.  Why not just show the whole thing at once?

So since you're used to living in a city I'm going to offer you some advice.

I would recommend spending more time in Hartford than West Hartford. West Hartford is a suburb and its biggest hangouts are a suburban mall with a Cheesecake Factory. Blueback Square is certainly not a dump. But at the end of the day, it's just a mall. My guess is that it's going to get old fast for you.

So here is the part where I'll plug Hartford. Things to do in Hartford: Bears BBQ, Blind Pig Pizza (same owner as Bears), see music at Arch Street Tavern. Drink beer at City Steam Brewery, Hog River Brewery in Parkville, Hanging Hills Brewery (they have community events too). Go to a Hartford Yard Goats (AA Baseball) game. See a play at one of downtown's theaters (student rush tickets are $15). Go to a creative cocktail hour. Learn printmaking at a class at Hartford Prints. Go to a Know Good Market event. Go to the Wadsworth Museum. See shows or take classes at Sea Tea Improv. Ride your bike in Hartford. Get familiar with Bicico in the Parkville neighborhood in Hartford. They're a bicycle co-op and they sell bikes. You might even be able to learn how to fix up your bike there.

My main point is this. Don't let co-workers or 'Hartford haters' on r/connecticut scare you in to thinking that the only things that are happening in the region are only in WeHa. Hartford is getting more stuff all the time. 

If you have any questions for me, feel free to PM - welcome to Connecticut!
Hmm Ill look into it thanks!

The Orders in Council were rescinded before the war and it because of Britains satisfaction for man power.  Britain never gave up their "right" to search American ships.
It really is. Some people fear discussion and just run away from critical thinking.

Your reasoning with John &amp; Sinbad makes total sense.  I think I could make the argument for Sinbad as rank #1 or #2.  IIRC, our class discussion produced similar results with the conservative guys ranking Abigail #1 &amp; stating she is a whore.
I love Christmas, but Amanda would destroy her. Then Amanda would cry.

Years ago I would go to the inspection mechanic and pay the fee, he would hand me the sticker and never even go out to look at my car.

I am aware of how Kanto came to be, that's why I said it was literally an afterthought. Because it was. It was nice, and I'm not mad at GSC for having these level scaling and curve problems (it was on the GameBoy after all). But HGSS still has the exact same problems, and that just proves that Game Freak can't juggle two regions. 

Either way both Johto and Kanto are small, and I think the Johto games are still great games to play, but it doesn't mean that their example should be followed.
Removed, another scamming related comment and you will be temporarily banned.
What an absurd reply.

You think the last two years have been met your "worst fears and dystopian narratives"?

Really?  WTF?  

The "most dystopian fears" Republicans were shouting that HRC would make herself king, and would literally ban religious ceremonies and was actually the antichrist herself, and would immediately start World War 3 with the Russians, and was actively and knowingly committing outright treason in the name of money.

What?!

It's funny, until that duel I thought Kallor was like, God-tier. He's been around so long if he was any older he'd've walked with K'Chain Che'malle. And yet, a hundred thousand years of practice with the sword didn't make him literally unbeatable? 

But then, if you're unkillable, why bother?

Yeah, hence me saying I would assume he meant the daughter not the mother as it could have been either.

This. You need a windows device to do assembly. Everything else it pretty system agnostic but you will be ahead if you know how to use the command line so using some *nix variant is probably the way to go.
Yes you do a regular bead first on half stitch /  then on the X feed it back through the bead to change its direction. I must admit I didn't do the X stitches on this one, I did them all half stitch because I preferred how the diagonal orientation caught the light and showed off the beads more.

I was getting skipped so it don't affect who is on the clock.
I love the much needed humor here, the intense (and captivating) battle for Nahash has been draining to say the least, but that is what war does to people. It's nice to see some life and balance slowly being restored. Again, just wanted to compliment you, and your player's skills for crafting such a deep world that feels so alive. Also, can't wait to read more of your prose!
so the " just get applied to every letter in the word? But which specific letter in the word changes from K to G?
not a different definition just the wrong word.

Stop copying people's copypastas, it's literally like these Aaron Judge home run threads always look exactly the same. Literally, it's the same damn copypastas. You could at least try making some original comments
I grew up in a similar culture to you. Married a virgin church girl. She had a beautiful voice and sang solos in church. Taught Sunday School and read her Bible. Nice blue eyed blonde girl from the Deep South. Basically she was a trad con wet dream. 

Annnddd......I'm here posting on MGTOW. AWALT is truth. Where you find a woman doesn't matter, she's still a woman.

I still attend church. I went to three services today. I'm in a position of leadership in my church. The thing is, I see so many men who've done everything right as I did. They've married the good girls and tried to do right only to be rewarded with divorce or a life of grinding misery.

Once cupcake divorces these men for "abuse" she skips off down the road to the next church to start fishing for her next blue pill victim. 

I won't presume to tell you what to do. However I have walked down the road you are considering and I suffered immense damage. 

MGTOW is truth.
that roast was real
Illumineddie lmao
What is there for them to explain?  The organization has no control over what their fans do.  Even if the founder of IMT came out and said "don't do that", there would still be people doing it.
Fair enough, and I would completely agree that special ammo of all types is a bit too abundant.

I have nothing but respect for high-mobility snipers. But when I load up Pantheon and see three people hardscoping right off spawn ... come on, man. And when I say hardscoping, I mean I'll sit on my ghost for the full respawn cycle and all three glows stay solid the whole time. That's the opposite of fast-paced gunplay.

Maybe make it so the scopes are stable for the first second or two, and then start to sway if you're just hardscoping? Sway is a thing in many games. It might have a place here.
Maybe Sylph, the boss of Siltbreaker Act II, will then be released as the new hero after TI7!!?!?!
That's a bit dramatic. Her mother knew about it. I can fault my girlfriend on a few annoying OCD like personality quirks, but she isn't out to defraud or scam.
Awesome, thanks! Still waiting for mine to arrive (I missed the first set of acrylic cases so had to wait for the 2nd stock). Will be my first time building/soldering, so your video will be a big help. Have fun with the build!
The Objective C education pipeline has dried up. Most blogs and books use Swift.  Three dozen Swift books in 18 months:

I actually have some EDTA blood "drying out" in a med cup in the truck now. I am going to swab some up and see if the smear is more dense. That's what I just said to someone else- didn't matter how much blood or what lighting or camera settings- I was not able to recreate the Rav 4 stain "density" if you will. If I put enough to make it a comparable color it dripped off the dash.

I usually took 4mg xanax then smoked and had a few drinks and felt great. Though you might want to do a few test runs to figure out your tolerance because the line between blacking out is very thin.
Even when/if you go back you should post in other places than BP. I imagine that is where your dirty/shady guy problem is coming from. Possibly not screening enough too? 

I'm at a price point in my area that's a little high for BP and a little low for Eros. And I'm posting to Eros, TER, and TNABoard. I'll be posting on P411 when I get enough reviews to qualify. And I'm not getting any dirty or shady guys. I'm also low volume and don't accept bookings less than 24 hours in advance. I would say that I am in a place where I can afford to be picky, but I really haven't had to reject many. 

As far as other sex work, I recommend /r/sexsells as a great starting point, offering Skype shows and sexting. Then reading /r/sellercircle and /r/sellercirclestage for advice on how to branch out from there!
Not the guy above, but I think I can give some pointers since I own a Molotov and love it. A generic Soviet cruiser captain should work well, meaning priority target, adrenaline rush (turret traverse is good enough no need for expert marksman), demolition expert, then concealment expert.

I have narcolepsy and I'm on adderall for it. Since I'm allergic to the other treatment options and will be on adderall indefinitely, my Dr has me do this. It sucks massively, but better than having it not work when I need it.
Invited one dude who I met in class to a party. I was a few years older and he was a sophomore still living in the dorms. Not only did he show up 2 hours early, he brought 8 freshmen from his dorm who were all hunting for poon. They probably all managed to get 2 or 3 beers out of the keg before one got in a fight with my roommate because my roommates gf was the only girl there and he decided to "call dibs". Heard them complaining about it being a sausage fest as we kicked them out...

Alesso looks absolutely miserable when DJing. He gives off no energy and the crowd sees that. He definitely needs to include "If I Lose Myself" in every set because it's one of the GOATs but he has fallen off harder than any artist in EDM imo.
Iowa cause. First state to vote for a Presidential candidate of *their* party. If Trump wins it means he's unstoppable. If he losses (what I am about to say is a theory) Cruz might go up a bit on the polls and Trump will probably have to fight harder to win other states.

Yeah ideally you play some discard and take it from there. However in the absence of information I would name either Karn or O-stone. Map doesn't sound like a bad option however naming doesn't stop a real threat and they probably run Sylvan Scrying/could draw the lands they need possibly.

The people who get these jobs can, actually.

Secondly even if they couldn't, they wouldn't need a job...they would need a day program. I don't like that my younger brother is being paid pennies to work in a recycling plant where he's being exposed to carcinogens. I would feel much more comfortable if he were finger painting all day. :\

I have both and I only use his BSB for niche situations or when I don't feel I need the safety net of Wall.  Is it difficult to fit in Protectga/Shellga in your ability slots?  Most standard builds don't really need their secondary ability for something crucial.  For example, a healer will usually be spamming heals after the initial Protectga/Shellga from their secondary ability slot, and a DPS/buffer can carry the paired buff in their secondary ability slot because they just typically use a Lifesiphon -&gt; SB rotation.
Sounds exactly like hiring a low rent shady mechanic to fix your car then wondering why your cheap fix isn't working as well as a professional tune up. There will always be scams and sharks in any business.

Libertarians also seem to end up at Christianity when they try to think how to best implement their ideas. How do you really have personal liberty as long as it doesn't hurt someone else? It's very difficult to determine in most situations whether or not you will inadvertently hurt someone else. If the society adopts Christian ideals though, they can get close to libertarianism.

Personal favorites are Tenno(since it gives you the exact colors for many warframes' defaults), Storm because its got some lovely colors and a few nice golds in it, and Classic Sat since, as you said, it covers a large range of colors. Orokin is also nice if you like those colors. I don't personally use it often, but it has the default prime frames' gold and some good blues and light browns.

You think they want to win us back. You bought their system. Your job is done.
If you have fryevia with her bis, then using her kit is better than using alterna since her strongest abilities can benefit from killers and elemental weaknesses and as a result, deal more damage than DC alterna.

I would say ring of lucii is best on t. Terra, since she has evasion already as well as DC and is the mage in the game capable of reaching the highest mag stat possible with her bis, plus her magic activation gives her an 80% mag boost.
I paid for the meal. The service was non-existent. However I did tip the server that refilled our drinks (he also ran our food).  I initially thought we had been passed off until I was waiting on the check.  

Non existent service equals non existent tip.  It is the only time I ever gave 0.00 and would do it again given the same circumstances. 

However, I am confused. Tipping them at all gives the out that I might be low on cash, unaware of protocol, etc.  But a 0.00 and a conversation with the manager ensures the company and the server have a chance to improve.

You guys are always a toss-up for us. The in-state rivalry is just too real for both teams and too early in the season.
I'm totally okay with that. Just a big PSA about this

That's something I would love to see. The game would become so awkward, that in a state of panic, both players would begin destroying their own buildings.

Unfortunately that isn't possible in KSP because the game uses two-body physics, whereas such orbits require n-body interactions. 

To make a long story short, KSP only cares about one source of gravity at a time (Kerbin, the Mun, Kerbol) when you're in its sphere of influence (SOI).

This orbit has a complex interaction between **both** the Earth and Sun's gravitational fields, which is why it doesn't work in KSP. I believe this relies on the Lagrangian point (someone correct me if I'm wrong) where the pull of the Sun and Earth's gravities are equal.
do they just stamp the cruiserweight logo on the corners?

So, IDK if I pulled this off but the idea behind this is that it's a word cloud with all the words liberals use surrounding "identifying as [race]" in light of the way liberals also use "identifying as [gender]" to ignore reality. It doesn't mean that race is real, it just means that liberals have a shitty way of talking about oppression. It also seems pretty racist in light of Rachel Dolezal that liberals *continue to use this phrasing*. You dig?
yea that's a really good point.

I'm mostly fine with Clippers fans (which fanbase doesn't have bad apples)? It's Chris Paul whom we can't stand. But we can respect Clippers fans for standing up for him. I'm sure we'd do the same if we had him on our team.

When it all comes down to it, throwing out hate, the truth is, Chris Paul is too talented to have to resort to flopping around and acting like a child every time a call doesn't go his way. That's just the truth of the matter, and anyone without rose colored glasses on can admit it.

Ah, I see. Why not just shorten the branches a bit and try to let it back-bud and fill in some lower branches? When I have a species that I'm unsure of, that's always my first option.

It doesn't have to be all or nothing, and you can let it show you what it can do by taking a more conservative approach and pruning further out in places that you'll eventually remove anyway. That way, you get to see how it responds to certain techniques before accidentally butchering it.

I've not worked with this particular species, so I can't speak for how well it will respond. I think maybe /u/adamaskwhy has worked with it - maybe he'd have more relevant advice. Hey Adam - do you have any advice on Green Island Fig?

On his way back from the local Stuffer Shack, Darius spots someone bowling with beer bottles in an alley and spoils a bit of their fun by knocking them over with magic before the ball hits. He passes by a roving pack of dogs, invoking a sneezing fit, before rounding the corner to his cruddy roach infested haven in the city. The comm pings when he gets inside.
"Hey, sorry I didn't tell you about that last job until the last minute.  I've got another one coming up soon that needs someone of your talents, let me know if you can go." - Skeeter the fixer

Super strange that this came up again, but a couple of days ago I was going to Beer Belly in Koreatown from DTLA.  Put 532 S. Western into my phone, got in the lyft, and we take off.  I'm looking at twitter for a little bit before I realize we're almost to Inglewood on the 110.  I asked her why we were going south, and she said her GPS was telling her to go that way.  Strangely, it also said 532 S. Western, but that address doesn't exist in Inglewood.  I have to give her my phone and she used my Waze.  

Edit: I paid the full fare.  It wasn't her fault.

High Schooler does mean a minor, to drop out of HS they would have to be 16-21 as 21 is the national cut off rate for High School.  This means a child can currently be held back two times before the student would have to go for their GED.  You said even high school drop outs can be a doctor. Part of the pool of HS drop outs is recent HS drop outs.
Well yes, you're wrong. And you also seem quite desperate to avoid answering my question, which frankly would be more interesting to discuss than trying to convince you of the well evidenced adverse side effects of anabolic steroid abuse. So.

Given the information about the side effects and addictive nature of these drugs, what do you suggest would be "appropriate limits" and what "trivial inconveniences" would you introduce to safeguard people from steroid abuse?

Like, do you just have no ideas about safeguards that could be introduced and would be acceptable to the trans community?

This happened to me yesterday morning for about an hour and a half straight.  I thought the game was glitching because it kept putting me in the wrong game mode.  Then I noticed that it was always S&amp;D, Nuk3town, and something hinky was definitely going on.  I especially noticed how it seemed that my teams spawn would never flip even though the other team was squatting right down on top of us.  Also, even though it said I had 17ms ping(with my internet I assure you this was wrong) there was either such bad lag or some sort of hacking going on(not sure which) that I could empty an entire Kuda magazine into a person and they wouldn't even know I was there.  Kills weren't impossible though, I did manage to get two before I bailed, and each was worth 500pts.

Not to mention how just 2-3 levels over a pokemon makes it vastly superior, often even negating type. 
I know it will never happen but I would love to see pokemon typing become the determining factor for strengths/weaknesses instead of the actual moves being used. If you are and icy pokemon and a charmander is hitting you even with tackle then it should be a fire infused tackle and at least do 1.5x damage. I might actually have to swap pokemon at some point if that were the case.

You get bigger by eating. I know, it sucks to have to eat when you just aren't hungry, but there's no other way to getting "big". As long as you don't force yourself to eat more than you are used to too much to fast, then you will not be throwing up. 

Abs are very possible. It depends on your bodyfat. If you don't have well defined abs at that weight and height, then you may be skinny fat (I have no idea if you are, no pics) But I wouldn't recommend trying to cut for a six pack if you want to get bigger.

Protein shakes are not the only way to getting bigger. It depends on what you eat, some good, healthy weight gainer foods I like are peanut butter and yogurt.

&gt;But this is question-begging against the theologian, isn't it? The theologian of course thinks that it is true, and falsifiable, so he thinks that it is worth teaching.

Wait... Is that me question-begging or unjustified holding of the position that "God exists"? I am interested in justification for "God existing" which is what theology hinges on. I do not think it is justified and hence a) I don't think it is a valid discipline and b) looking for theologians to justify it.

&gt;temporary debuffs for the most part

&gt;hard hitting once in awhile

[Here's a venn diagram](http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/14076.png) of how I see the two systems; A is scars and wounds, B is Laying Waste.

When Laying Waste hands out minor debuffs, scars and wounds doesn't do anything; when scars and wounds becomes active, Laying Waste is dropping "permanently blind", and "target's heart ruptured" (I just hit the generator twice). The biggest difference, IMO, is that Laying Waste is simply a more cohesive system; plus, severity is more consistent, you're not randomly getting a minor scar or losing an arm, you're losing an arm or something relatively comparable. Perhaps a broken jaw seems less severe, but taking away a caster's ability to use verbal components?

I used scars and wounds prior to Laying Waste, and I've found the later more or less just expands and improves upon the former.

But, it's your game, do what you wanna do; I can't tell you, who to sock it to. :P

hahahahaha same to the seocnd half.  But for me it was like...I knew it wasn't Sidney, Gale, Randy, or Dewey, and after they took out Tatum (who I was getting a LITTLE suspicious of) I was like oh ugh it's definitely one of those two (was more suspicious of Stu at that point).  

I do think the other 3 reveals were more surprising (obviously with Mrs. Loomis being so random, Roman after his fake death, and JILL was such a treat especially with the dialogue leading up to it), even if I didn't think Roman's role was great.  But I'm glad the way Scream 1 happened, and still dont' get if Billy/Stu were supposed to be a couple.

Came to mention something like this. The server runs as user Plex. Even if you setup groups and stuff it has issues seeing anything in your home directory. Setting everything in your home to 777 isn't good practice, make yourself a directory for media there or outside home and fix the permissions in that location. Don't need 777 either, you can get by with less. When adding new files to your media location make sure you set permissions on the new stuff correctly

You must have misunderstood. What has gone to shit with the game. I am not talking about the hype surrounding microtransactions. I am asking you what exactly is Bluehole doing to the game that has made it worse. The TKing ban should not have come from PlayerUnknown and he should not have made it "personal", as in, it coming from his account and his justification being related to his own personal experience and not a straight "he broke the rules" explanation. All the drama is literally about nothing, and I am trying to get the hate brigade to articulate exactly what the issue is instead of relying on emotive shitposting.

I have a panic disorder as a result of sexual violence and I have a really hard time staying present in my body when I am spiraling in or out of a panic attack because I tend to disassociate and can't verbalize what I am feeling. 

Lush has been very helpful in grounding me into my body and focusing on my physical sensations. Sometimes I can only nod when my partner asks what if a bath or shower would be helpful so he sets one of those up with my favorite scent families and it is much easier to ground myself focusing on the pattern or sound of a bath bomb or thinking through the steps of a shower. 

My partner is less than enthused about the fact that he knows to match Jason and the Argan Oil with Rose Jam SG but he likes that we have a plan in place.

I agree.

I don't know if there is a way to keep the colors equally represented and having all archetypes viable at the same time. If we work in the manner that all colors are represented, but not in the same archetypes eg so that blue features prominently in tempo and control decks whereas Black is mainly a color for midrange rather than every color having go-to options for the various archetypes it sounds feasible. I don't know if it is possible and despite how much fun it'd be to try, it would take quite some experimenting to find out what cards needs to come and go to get there.
plenty of single player games still sell millions of copies, what you said is just not true.
To clarify, I'm not advocating a society where people do not work. My ideal is a society where people organize work on their own terms, without need for an owner or boss-- the way many people organize themselves to do productive activities outside of work every day. For those who are able to contribute to society and do not, the consequence is natural- societal shaming. For those who cannot work or have difficulty working due to sickness, old age, etc., they are supported by society, unlike the current system where many such people end up on the streets.

I don't see the harm - and see benefit.

If someone gets a degree - it is either of worth to the person or it isn't.  It's not as though (choose your favorite restaurant/store) gives huge discounts to "people with degrees" and we're all saying "oh, man, that's not fair to count THAT as a degree"

and if someone is going to be in the religious field I'd much rather they had an instructed background in thought and history.
I'm sure there's a sub for that, but I don't really want to find out.

Keep the grampa shades on man.
You know how if you listen to something over and over again, it just becomes sounds? With Envy's voice he only has to repeat it once and I can't recognize the words anymore.

URAH URAH URAH
Because both of them are fairly easy to defeat if you are a good shot, or have decent game sense
they couldnt call a 5 min cease fire with in a reasonable time... come on! most people would understand. they were just being huge dicks like most indoor ranges.
I'd be really curious to see some professional players trying it out compared to the sensitivity they actually use. Not as a means to see if it works, or if they should change, but what sort of variation it finds  (or doesn't find).
Sexy sexy woman
He quickly carries her back, keeping a straight but embarrassed face.

Note older people went to college at like a 10% rate.  Contrast that with the 60% of people under 30.
Ditto on that spook part.
Not on Xbox
They're identical, it's just an aesthetic choice.

Although what kind of numbskull would ever choose the wobbly, mismatched M1A1 over the sleek and sexy M1 is beyond me.
He's the more "successful" brother in life and has made some efforts to talk a couple times throughout these years, but i always freeze up and give halfhearted responses.
It becomes a little sluggish carrying the landing gear and cam so you'll be up in the mid to 3/4 throttle range a lot more and you'll always want to be in High mode. With no cam and no landers attached I can get about 20 mins on a 750mah battery. With the cam and landing gear to keep the cam off the ground it's more like 13-16 mins depending how hard I'm flying.

I have some 600mah batts and 500 mah and both seem to benefit from the lighter weight (my 750s look like 2 of the others slapped together) and go for around 10-15 mins with nothing attached, about 5-7 with cam/landers.
5 stickers isn't a car wrap. And the stickers aren't even that big (he claimed there would be a huge TriHard).

He overhyped it so much, of course people will be disappointed.
I dunno about "subhuman," but it's definitely not cool.
Happy birthday!
Kinda random but what does your name mean? Phile is like "like" generally but I have no idea what the first part is.
nah I've never read anything with her in it (even though she seems like an awesome character), but I've read a bunch of X-23's stuff (please let Kyle &amp; Yost write her again!!!)
Please make it more obvious that you don't know what you're talking about.
Idk, when it was the go home show for wrestlemania and raw was in pittsburg, both taker and reigns was equally cheered in this city. Or closet reigns fans are coming out.

Mr. Robot, there is only one season so far but I watched the whole thing in one day.
I swear to god it feels like it's always his birthday. That's a good thing.
The shooting in End of Watch
To a certain extent, yes. But getting your CPA lessens it. So does going back for a Masters or MBA. Personally, I had zero desire to work for a public accounting firm so it worked well for me. 

I also love the benefits. I get tons of vacation time and my pay is comparable to my peers.

Risks are for the challenger, not the champ.

If you're making the most money you've ever made in your life, you don't risk that.

That's what I bought, and it's good enough for me. I'm not crazy into GC as far as smash and whatnot, but I didn't notice too much difference. I mean I use it for my 2nd player controller, for nhl hitz and Mario kart. If you truly wanted an oem stick, the c-stick and left are the same. So you could buy a controller with a busted left stick, and desolder the c-stick if it's not thrashed and used that. You can usually find a busted GC controller for 5 bucks.
How about being an adult and stopping it, Matt?
Wyrd Sisters is Macbeth from the witches point of view.
Makes sense. Plus you get a cool shot of knifing open the bag
I'm certain I can hear the end of Colborn's sentence pretty clearly after a few listens, but I'm not sure if I should type it yet because it may cause confirmation bias as may be the case with those hearing "here's the car" in the background...

Try it another time or two and try to tune her out. I really want someone else to hear it so we can compare!
Growling works, but can also be used to more specifically refer to stuff that sounds like the cookie monster. 

On the flip side, regular singing is often referred to as clean singing.
You're just saying that to get into my sweatpants.

That's cool, but if y'all are gonna fight over it in front of me when I have other things to do, and he puts the card down first, you're gonna get some cheesy shit, because I literally do not have time to watch a couple adorably argue over who is paying.
Taking a hit generates 50(?) SB points, and 500 gives a full gauge. Retaliating those hits instead gives a net attack potency of 10, while a Soul Break can do much more than that. And except for special cases like Gilgamesh's BSB or USB, Retaliate strategies take both ability slots.

When taunts aren't viable because it's a PHY AoE, Cecil's Cover LM still does great work. If it's because it's NAT, at least a taunt gives a stackable DEF buff that would help with Guardbringer.

Magic Lure is the other option if not bringing Celes or Exdeath for Runic.

Of course, this is still a very good En-Holy Soul Break.
My takeaway from this scene is that DG doesn't have a firm grasp on the definition of rape.  Nobody in calls Jamie a rapist, nobody calls Geneva a rapist, and yet . . .
Looks really good!
Actually it's not redicolous at all considering the very inflated sense of self importantce they have.  They caught bombers, after all...

Glad to hear bud!  I use Sorc cuz i needed him for mainly Belial and 1 Fairy usually wasnt good enough (minus probably Scorpion).  But Drummer only adds about 3% ~ 6% additional dps over Sorc if my math is correct (depending on what unit and im not too sure on exact interaction between crits and abilities).

Also, once you get Sorc's pet (totem thing) to 5*, he offers a lot of cc protection that i think may override a Fairy.  From what i read, upon Sorc spawning, all units are cleansed of any cc and also are immune from them for a short time.  Plus his totems last 50% longer.  So a lot of potential there over a Fairy.


Edit:  just read your "edits" after i posted.

I feel happy for Gambit, but especially happy for Zeus.  Dude gets stabbed in the back and kicked from NaVi, is "demoted" to Gambit and has now won DH Winter and DH Austin.
Ish?

But if you have to ask that question here you probably aren't capable of it just yet.
Now I live in Shirley (South of the High Street) I have to say that you can't quite generalise like that! Foundry Lane and the roads off of it aren't bad at all with nice appearances, and are very quiet and seem to be safe. You're right in that Upper Shirley (which is North) is pretty fancy, but you also have the council housing and Shirley Towers North of the High Street which does sometimes look a bit run down.

Regent's Park is not Northlands Road area - it is close to Shirley and Millbrook, sort of inbetween them. In terms of how nice the area it is, it depends which bit really. Regent's Park Road is pleasant, as are the roads that come off it.

To u/Solarbeef, I just want to add to the comments above! 

Polygon: Noisy as fuck when the students are in. If you want quiet streets in the evenings then that isn't going to happen at term time! Lots of big houses to rent.

Inner Avenue: If you're further South, the area's a little more studenty and less tidy looking, but north has roads like Winn Road and Westwood Road which have loads of flats and apartments. You're close to the common there, and town isn't a long walk away.

Shirley: I'm biased as I bought a place here after living on Hill Lane for 6 years! The high street is an interesting little place. Lots of odd people, but Mostly Harmless. Lots of charity shops, but also butchers, green grocers, pasty shops, plenty of takeaway places, a few decent restaurants, a good number of pubs, a McDonalds (ha), some supermarkets (Iceland, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Polish and European places) and a gym. And a mail depot!

Portswood: Very similar to Shirley in terms of amenities, but the residents are more studenty whereas Shirley is quite a mix of all age groups (and income levels too). Fewer odd people roaming the main street!!

Hill Lane and Upper Shirley: Very fancy! Close to the Common, and nice and quiet. Lots of big, expensive houses. A little further from a main high street, and a little bit of a longer walk to town. Quiet but close enough to main roads to get on them quickly if driving to work.

Freemantle: A lot like Shirley, really, in terms of the types of houses and people, but from wandering around it seems there are probably more rented houses and the appearance sometimes reflects that. A little further from high streets and main shops, but a pretty short walk to the train station. Quite cheap rent wise too, and lots of purpose built flats in some of the roads.

It depends where you're from, but I think most people would feel safe in most of Southampton. If I was to tell my friends from the village I lived in areas to avoid, I'd go with Thornhill, St Mary's, Rownhams, Millbrook and Maybush. Plenty of lovely people live there but the areas just aren't as nice as the rest of Southampton.
Haha, thanks!

Humour. The people here have a great sense of humour and it helps.

People here also have an attitude of "Just get on with it." But there is also the idea that the IRA's terror campaign was never about racking up an "infidel" body count like you see in other conflicts. They had contacts at various news rooms and a list of code words so that when they planted a bomb they would give a warning and the army would have enough time to evacuate the area and prevent mass casualties. So in that sense civilians were *usually* not directly targeted so people just went about their business somewhat safe in the knowledge that if there was a bomb it probably wasn't meant for them.

That being said there were some bad periods where there were attacks which had the sole purpose of targeting civilians and killing them from whatever side, a grenade thrown into a the crowd at a funeral for example, or indiscriminately shooting into a bar frequented by one side or the other. But for the most part the major IRA bombings were not aimed at killing normal people but more to destroy a building, make a statement, or assassinate a particular person or group of people (usually the army/police). They felt that killing too many people with the bombings would cause them to lose support and ultimately that's partly what happened with the Omagh bomb which was the worst single incident of the entire ordeal killing 29 people. The cease fire had already been in place for 2 years at that point but it was tenuous and there was still a lot of support for the IRA and it's various now split factions, but after that point they quickly lost a lot of whatever support was left.

The army, RUC and now the PSNI are and have always been since the start directly targeted so for them and their families it's a different story, but they are trained for it so it doesn't have the same impact that it may have on a civilian. We are one of the only modern countries where *all* our police are trained in anti ambush and anti terrorism tactics. Basically every police officer in Northern Ireland is trained to a *similar* standard as a SWAT team in another country might be, which again is unique in the UK.

Sorry for the rambling this ended up being way longer than it needed, the point I was intending to make is this; neither side ever really trusted or relied on the government here, or the army or the police so when there was an incident they pulled together as a community to cope with it and deal with it, some times that led to retaliation some times not but the point is they relied on their communities for support rather than the government, apposed to dealing with it by sitting at home and hoping that big brother takes care of business for you which seems to be the go-to reaction in America. "What is the government going to do about it?" "How did they let this happen" etc etc. Where as here there was much more an attitude of "What can we do about it."

TL:DR, We have a great sense of humour and a great sense of community even if the communities were completely polarised and at each others throats for a long time.

Shitty tournament with shitty teams.
To whoever greenlit the tractor: TRACTORS AREN'T SPOOKY.
Oh man, I could go quite a ways with this but I can think of two matches off-hand:

Mira Williams vs Katrina Avenko: this match, I tell you now, I would *definitely* have to see it 'till the end as both are evenly trained out with fighting techniques, military backgrounds and all around fighting abilities. Bear in mind that Williams is both an Organic and Synthetic being at the end of the trilogy she's in and that Avenko is a powerful superhuman who's power *almost* rivals that of Kyle's powers (1 of my earlier characters) before he fully *Ascended* to his hybrid form. Than again, I may be slightly off. But still, the fight would be a match made in Heaven.

Anakan Krowe and Mira Williams vs Vallek and Rick Williams: This match is as unorthodox as it is untraditional as the last 2 are my oldest characters are the main villains and the first 2 are my new heroes. It's also unorthodox because although Mira and Rick do share a common last name, they share another trait: both are hybrids. One's an Andro-Draconis (part man and dragon being), the other's an organic/synthetic being. As for Krowe and Vallek, it'd be an interesting fight because both are powerful in their own rights.

someone who does not realize heller is not entirely constitutional.

SCOTUS is not allowed to CHANGE the constitution.

so when they make a decision that it is in clear and obvious conflict with the actual constitution (not their "desired" interpretation of it)

then the decision is null and void and not legally valid (though it is of course enforced. ENFORCED does not equal lawful)

heller was a shit show

the entire constitution applies to all states in all cases. anyone who says otherwise (historically not today) is either a fucking moron or has a HUGE agenda and does not want it to apply.

you had to retify the fucking thing to join this union. YES it applies.

self defense? the second amendment had absolutely nothing at all to do with home self defense.

it had to do with defending against all enemies foreign and domestic. it had to do with over throwing an invalid government if it over stepped its boundaries defined by WE the people.

that and ONLY that is what the second amendment is for and the only people who EVER say otherwise are either brought up today with all our bullshit already in place or have a huge agenda in violation of the constitution.

self defense and hunting and sporting are so "duh" that they are not even mentioned in the constitution for they are not relevant.

how about "reading the constitution"

you know. the supreme law of this land and RECOGNIZING that SCOTUS decisions while enforced are many times flat our illegal.

I went to high school with a girl who was less than "normal". She was very sweet but full of energy. She would skip everywhere and sing between classes. She'd compliment your fingernail polish or chat with the lunch ladies until she was late to class. You'd think she'd be loved by everyone, but sometimes she just couldn't handle her energy. She'd snap here and there.  
You'll be talking to her and she'll randomly say something very harsh. Then she'd cover her mouth and immediately apologize. She tried cutting her own hair and failed miserably, so she wore different wigs. A lot of people called her crazy, Brittney Spears, that kind of stuff. I used to snap at people myself and tell them to not bully her. She seemed like a truly good but troubled soul.  
She wanted to join the track team, but she took medicine that slowed her down. I'm not sure of the specifics. But she needed that medicine to keep herself in check. She stopped taking it though.  
A week before graduation she missed a day of school. There was a nasty rumor that she went off the deep end and killer her sister. I told them all to stop saying such nasty things. I really liked this girl. She was even my lab partner all year.  
[Lo and behold...](http://www.hometownstations.com/story/15956980/kenyada-jackon-found-not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity)  
Yeah, she stabbed her mom, killed her toddler sister, cut out her sister's organs, then shoved them into the oven.  
I still think she's a troubled soul. But she's still a threat to society and should be locked up. I'm not personally sure if she could possibly be rehabilitated, but I doubt it. Long story short, she definitely was strange, but it was dependent on the person whether or not it was a good or bad kind of strange.

I think that right now would be the perfect time for Heyman to build a stable since Titus is building "Titus Worldwide". While right now it's a bit of a joke, many good gimmicks have started that way(Sheamus and Cesaro for example) and I think it has real potential especially if he's given the right foil.
I definitely second the job at a place that sells food idea. In fact, a "friend" of mine works at subway during the day (free sub each shift---be sure to pile on ALL the veggies 'cause veggies ain't cheap) and then slept on milkcrates in the back room at night. Could also use the fridge in the back to store some groceries.

Well, that video was garbage, but it's hardly inciting violence or anything like that. Seems like just another overreaction to shut up the twitter mob.
I'm with you. If someone is tired and sees the end of life as soon, what the hell are you going to do? Tie them down and force them to live? He's an adult, you have -zero- legal standing to force treatment, nor is it morally acceptable to attempt to do so.

The entity you encounter? That's affecting you, so taking action is logical. Imposing your subjective idea of the "right" way to live or die? That's an awful insult to human sovereignty, man.
I used mace to defend myself against an attacker and another person who wasn't attacking was hit I was charged with agg assault. So yes I'm sure on that law 1000% it's not battery it's agg assault as for syg Google any of the cases heard in Arizona on that even our concealed permit classes we don't need Inform you of the rights of syg also my brother being a police officer here I Arizona I can assure you I'm quite sure of our laws.
Absolutely zero clue and it gets worse the drinker I get. Once I literally had a girl proposition me and it wasn't until after she left someone told me she liked me. I was surprised.

I've collected Dual Wield and Genji Glove thanks to the anniversary event and got Excalibur to about 50%. The rest came from the following event mog and grinding to 100% (which I finished just about an hour ago, so that's done now) Next, I'm aiming for Chizuru, Rikku, Gaffy, and Trance Terra's TMRs as they would be most useful. I also have as other options, Ribbon, Water Blade/Sword (whatever its called), Stone/Dragon Killer, Dark Knight's Soul and others that make a list too long I'm willing to take the time to type at this time.
While they're not societal norms yet, there's a fad going around for special "chocolate" diamonds. They're actually ridiculously common 
 (the most common in fact) and have been sold for a long time for tools. Diamond tipped bits and whatnot use chocolate (or brown diamonds as they're actually known) diamonds because they're cheap, not considered aesthetically pleasing (until marketing rebranded them) and easy to find while still having all the durability of other diamonds.
Still selling ? Dm me I'm interested

&gt;we have to stop bitching about abortion, gay marriage, illegal immigration, and the drug war. Conservatism has beed tied way too tightly to Evangelical Christianity. I'm as Christian as anyone else, but I don't think we need more Jesus in our politics.

Would you identify as pro choice and pro gay marriage?  As a constitutional conservative, I would argue that marriage is not a right and it should be settled at the state level along with abortion and drugs.  I 100% agree on the religious pandering, but I also think it's important for evangelicals to vote.

&gt; I think it’s interesting that, for you, the mental and physical well-being of rape victims

You have already started to create a narrative here with your language. 

First of all, you implicate that I don't care for the mental and physical well being of the rape victim. 

Of course I do. 

Then, you implicate that the totality of the rape victim's lack of mental and physical well being is a result of having to carry the baby to term.

No, a large portion of it is from the rape itself.

Now, being pregnant and not being allowed to kill said baby will no doubt cause her a lot of **temporary** mental and physical grief, and a smaller amount of close to permanent mental/physical grief. Rape is a terrible thing. 

I do care for her well being, but at the same time I care for the well being of the growing child. 

And I cannot sacrifice the life of the child just to make her wellbeing a bit better. Or even a lot better. 



&gt;and the falsely accused

Now you are bringing up a group that will be of an extremely small number. 

Rape victims is relevant, and this is too, but let's acknowledge that the numbers of falsely accused, especially in a convoluted and difficult system, will not be huge. 

Further **you assume** the system will require a specific accuser, and that **DNA Tests** won't be able to prove who is right. 

Sure, before DNA tests go active, it might cause grief. But that will be proven temporary, and punishments in place for intentional false accusations should push this down. 

But again, **you are ASSUMING** a specific accuser must be named to draw these conclusions.

What if this isn't a requirement? 

Then your argument largely falls apart in this aspect, though I'm sure some small number would still exist.





&gt;(both groups comprised of sentient,)

Sentience is not a necessary requirement for Personhood, not by the definition I believe. 

So this means nothing to me. 

&gt; innocent humans) 

Oh, just like the innocent unborn ones. 

Except these ones aren't being executed. 

&gt;can only be consistently eclipsed by the birth of non-sentient humans.

You mean by *the LIFE* of thousands of times more unborn humans.


Not just the birth, though that is the main aspect of it.

&gt;This really does get to the crux of the matter that neither side seems to want to admit

With quite a bit of bias, yes. 

&gt;: how do we weigh the rights and well-being of innocent people? 

Certain things are clearly greater evils.

Executions of thousands of innocent humans daily is pretty hard to top.

&gt; Whose life is “worth” more?

Now slow your roll here buddy. Don't start trying to equate the mental and physical grief a rape victim suffers from being pregnant with her dying. 

I 100% support medical abortions. If a rape victim will die by being pregnant, I support being able to abort that child. 

So it's not about equating the "life worth" of victims. 

&gt;For the extreme pro-lifers, it sounds as though the lives of unborn children outweigh the lives of everyone else.

Radicals of every group usually hold radical opinions that don't reflect the whole.

With my suggested tweaks in addition to the base damage of 300, Boar Prime gets something like 50k/60k sustained DPS (depending on if you use Dual Stat of 90%). 

Personally think that's too much for the Boar Prime, since it is mostly a CC status gun (although you certainly can ignore that in favor of damage), which is about the same as the Vaykor Hek on certain builds (I believe Vaykor gets up to 72k sustained DPS at max, but you can't turn it into a CC machine gun like the Boar Prime, so I think it's fair that Vaykor gets more damage. That and Vaykor is MR12, while Boar Prime is MR2). 

250 is a very good compromise, if you ask me.

The context is if he gets the same as Miliband (which btw is more than Brown got in 2010), then he isn't any worse than the more centrist Labour politicians. They've all been saying, the closer to the centre, the more votes you get, the more left you go, the less. Corbyn getting 30% would prove that wrong.

Wow very out of touch with history.  Read a book on WW2.  Spain was nothing but a training ground for Hitler's troops and a pointless war for any peaceful countries to get involved in.  

Now if you want to talk about the other 10 times Hitler made power plays against France, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, fine.  But Spain was just a sideshow.

I fed about 250 people for a weekend - lunch and dinner twice. Literally bought all of the whole filets the warehouse had in the cooler, about 80 pounds of chicken, hundreds of burgers and dogs and veggie burgers, all the buns, plates, napkins, cups, condiments, etc. 

A bunch of sides - potato salad, macaron salad, whatever the deli had that day, etc. 

It was a crazy trip - at least 5-6 carts and a long checkout.   

We had a blast.

I wonder if they ask because you used to work while you had kids. I feel like most parents make the choice to stay at home immediately following the birth of their first (or second or third) child. If I knew someone who had worked for years and then stopped when their youngest child was 4, I would assume that they wanted to be a working parent and that this was an unfortunate temporary condition. 

I'm not saying that you are doing anything wrong! But maybe understand that it isn't the typical way things go, so I would acknowledge that in your response: "I know a lot of parents are looking to go back to work when their youngest is heading into school, but we've decided that I am going to be a sahp for this season. It's different, but I'm excited about the change!"

And own it! You've worked and you have worked hard, and now you are working in a different capacity. There is nothing wrong with your choice.

The fact that he was only in the running for the spot and was never actually announced as the director show that at the slightest hint of blood in the water they will jump on it.

You're being downvoted but you're right.  You get what you pay for in most of America.  Cheap houses are often located in places where good jobs are hard to come by and the city you're in doesn't feel like a city, but a clusterfuck of suburbs where people spend ungodly amounts of time in traffic trying to get to their mediocre jobs.

It's amazing how you can made a decision at this point on what kind of lifestyle you want to show, and focusing on what is most important to you first... getting by with what you can, or holding out for the best, you can start your stuff with  different styles like minimalistic, quirky esoteric or eclectic, or junkyard hand-me-down recycled &amp; repurposed stuff,  or only buy brand new as you can afford it.  Whatever you do make a plan and stick with it.      I've got my kitchen in 1930's farm house style with the old Felix the cat swinging tail and shifting eyes, my living room is comfy 1990's with American indian motif,  and my bedroom is recycle chic' - an eclectic mix from thrift shops and craigslist,  my eldest son has his room in expensive mancave and high tech dorm style,  and the youngest son has his strictly functional - all black and glass.  I like to find free furniture and rehab it, then paint it.  See photo:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CupYwDo.jpg)... not bad for a 60 yo lady?

Banning a parser seems like a stupid way to try to get a community to be more welcoming. The community manager should have actually tried to start a grassroots effort in the game to welcome and hopefully train these DPS noobies.

I have these two younger cousins that are literal demon spawns... the youngest in particular, about a couple of years ago took taking a temper tantrum to a whole different level. I hadn't seen it directly but I was told the day after that this happened by the oldest that is about my age, basically: My younger cousin took a major tantrum after he was kicked off the computer for playing too long, after some screaming he was sent to him room by my uncle. After a good while, my younger cousin came out and called the police, accusing his dad of domestic abuse. The police came over to check up the situation and my uncle had to explain everything, and was furious. My youngest cousin got grounded for a very long time.

I find that really quite touching and wonderful actually, that they care so much about the world and story you have created that they want to read it before their life ends. Having had people in my life who have suffered cancer it warms my heart that you would do that for a fan. 

Of course it is very risky, and so I do think authors should be careful doing this. Faking or not they could just as easily release it online for everyone to read. Perhaps I am naive, but I like to think that people are better than that, and that in realizing what the author has done for them - especially since you have absolutely no obligation to do that for them, even if they are terminal - they wouldn't release it. But who knows. As you said it is very risky.

Sorry, I rambled quite a bit there.

What do you mean "may be new twin"? Jeskai Saheeli is way, way easier to interact with than twin was - Twin can conceivably win without giving the opponent a chance to interact with Sorcery speed cards while also tapped down an opponent's land. Jeskai Saheeli either needs to wait until turn 7 to tap out completely for the combo or risk not having the combo go off. You can't tap out for Saheeli on 3 and then play Felidar on 4 like you could flash in Exarch on 3 and then tap out for Twin on 4.

Jeskai Saheeli is a good deck. I'm skeptical about the 4 mainboard Condemns in the deck, which just seems bad in most matchups, and I don't think it has another wincon besides beats if the opponent manages to Surgical Saheeli or Felidar, but the core of the deck is 100% solid. Not nearly as good as twin though.
I was called 'Why Ty' as a small child. So asking why is natural to me.  ;)

My first time cliff diving it took all the courage I had just to step off the cliff (this sudden, if not small, burst of courage just happened to coincide with a pretty girl showing up).  Unfortunately, I was supposed to *jump* out-and-away from the cliff, not just feebly step off the edge like Mr. Magoo.

So I landed in the shallows and messed my foot up on some underwater rocks.  

Spoiler alert:  The girl was not impressed.

That's definitely possible, but yeah I feel it kinda defeats the purpose of the single player/coop experience vs an MMO. An admin can resurrect anybody with a console command as well, although doing that to quest-related NPCs might make things screwy. I'd really like to see a lore-friendly resurrect spell/scroll that could be used, especially for fellow players (hell there might be a mod for this already). Currently when you die, you respawn at the nearest temple, and it can be a pain in the ass having to run back.

Tell her this exactly. Be clear that sex is a necessary ingredient in the relationship you're looking for, and the continued lack of a sexual relationship is damaging your self esteem. 

She will either clear up the miscommunication one way or another, or she will try to stall you. Be clear and steady in what you need and be ready to walk away if you aren't going to get it.

It's great that you got accepted into your MS program right out of school. I did my MBA right after I graduated with my accounting degree also. But if I can be honest, and I could do it all over again, I would try to get an accounting job right away, entry level or intern, while you study for and sit for the CPA exam. If you can swing it study for the exam and do your MS program at the same time, this way your employer will likely pay for your master's degree, and all your study courses for the CPA, or at least a portion of them.

Doing it this way I think would solve a couple of problems. First of all you would get to try out the field of accounting and see if it's even for you. Furthermore you might decide that you like one area better than the other, audit versus tax. Depending on what the master's program looks like, you could focus your courses in one or the other, or maybe even switched to a masters in taxation. Secondly I think most people on this forum would agree that experience trumps everything in the accounting field, so the sooner you can acquire the experience and knowledge in the field the better off you're going to be long-term in your career. Just my two cents, I could be wrong, but looking back this is how I would have done it
And his burning hot abs!
I think you have an amazingly strong start, both in terms of imagery, flow, and content.  There are some weaker spots where the progressions get a little broken, though.  The jump from 'stay with me' to immediately 'taken from me' is a bit abrupt, and then there is some lack of clarity-- If the wife (I assume) was 'taken', and gave her life, why is he imploring she 'remember me'?  Obviously there could be some duality in the meanings that I am missing, but that part was a bit shaky to me.  Other than that, great job so far!

This is often a trick that big companies use to hire talented people for less money and prevent them from leaving the company. 

By keeping you from finishing your degree, a lot of other companies will not even look at your résumé, regardless of your actual work experience. 

Be very careful going down this path as it is very attractive in the short term but can have some serious long term consequences.
Hell no your question doesn't bother me. Although, that *might* have something to do with your name being cutie and your flair being 20/f .

That's fair. In that case, I would suggest the Witcher series. Of course, a part of me is fangirling about the game, but the books themselves are a great heroic fantasy on an epic scale. The way the books' chronology works is "short stories first, and then the novels", so it is easy for you to get into the world with a low time investment with the short stories and then move onto the longer, more traditional sort of heroic/epic fantasy that spans multiple books if you like it or not. Think of it like appetizer followed by the main course; and you can leave the table if you disliked the appetizer. (What a mangled, terrible analogy...)

Ah, what a classic. One of the better textbooks I've had

Passed away? I'm so sorry. Left you? I still feel really bad for you. You'll ace the paper don't worry.
&gt;the guy just isnt that good.

In reference to andrew luck...that is all I needed to read.
&gt; I always thought it is so interesting how well-written stories on 4chan could easily be true and easily be fake.

Like tears in the rain.
Its all good! Thanks for the info!
Agreed, sac is super clique-y, I've always felt that. I'm not gay, but I do think that the gay community is much more inclusive in general, which is good.

If they threw at judge as well there would 1000% have to be suspensions.  What's stopping garbage tier loser teams from just hitting players they don't like?
Nice cop fam! 450 is a good price tho, been seeing people buying for 480 and up in my city
Go inside.
You can hit me up when I play I just build random stuff in creative tushfeathers88
Ok no worries.
How often are particles left out in regular conversation?
I wouldn't say she was emulating them so much as loosely basing herself on them.  Plus, you have to keep in mind that she was a face while loosely basing herself on her dad, which she sucks at.  She's actually good at being a heel and ripping off her dad.  

The whole "she's a nepotist!" thing works into her heel gimmick, and makes you want to hate her.  That same notion was built into her as a face, when she was the first to win the Diva's Title out of the horsewomen and seemed to be the worst one.  In essence, the heel turn has been natural and it makes sense.
No, it most certainly is not.  We would not *have* a United States of America if we hadn't transitioned away from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution.
A pretty (not hot but pretty) girl I worked with was acting weird all day during our shift. She would make moaning noises and giggles randomly, didn't matter if she was alone of someone next to her. I asked several times if she was ok and she would giggle and say she was fine.
Finally towards the very end of our shift she comes close to me, leans in, and says "I got my clit pierced this morning, you wanna see it?" Like an absolute moron I said "Naw, I'm good."
That was 14 years ago and I still regret it.
I wanted this tablet but i do not have the $900 (after taxes) to buy it here in Canada. Probably will settle for the Lenovo tab 4 once that releases.
well not anymore, had to add sb chaks for another deal, as well as the saff lobos. Sry, was for the body i wanted. So yellow ara, res asterias and what other wheel would you like? If you still want to trade for those.
I use my fitnesspal. I don't put workouts in it (I log them in a daytimer). I do put my weight in every morning. End if the week in average it. If I'm feeling super tired or did a hard workout I make sure to eat a little more (I usually have an apple and peanut butter to go over). I'm still new to this but so far it's working for me.
If that's the case, sure, that would be great! Right now, this is the only Kilton information I have:

Do you like your toppings?
We used OO for every savory dish. I use peanut oil for sweets and deep frying.  Think about it... Prior to industrialization, only oil you could cold press or small batch process using low heat temps was even possible. Humanity has lived on olive oil for 10,000 years of agricultural history.  So can we.  ☺

Seriously wtf happened
OK sorry about the snarky comment apparently you didn't know. You can unlink your account from steam and make it a Funcom one. Using the good old launcher. There's a FAQ somewhere, but basically you need to go to your account page and change some stuff.
Northern Irish here. These sound fine to me.
Just to check, do you have anything else other than Contraption Maker?
Hey James earl jones finally gets to be Darth Vader and not just his voice.
203?
I'm sorry, Im having some issues in a discord server and was in a rush to fix em
&gt; I've always thought the four emperors would represent the four main types of powers in the OP universe.

Reasonable assumption. I thought something similar around this time.
&gt; My theory is that Shanks could have a 4th type of haki, as I think him simply having ridiculously strong haki is way too underwhelming. There has to be something special.

On the surface that sounds reasonable. But who's to say you can't just be *that* much better with the regular 3 Haki types?
&gt; While I don't think this, it would be cool if he has eaten a unique and fourth type of devil fruit, as haki haki no mi fits the general four letter code, and yes I know there are exceptions.

I think a Haki Haki fruit would just count as a Paramecia
&gt; Kaido being zoan is obvious as can be, I'm guessing mythical zoan, type; minotaur.

It isn't a spoiler to say, others have guessed he's a dragon or an Oni.

I personally think he's just really really strong. No fruit, otherwise he could've killed himself by drowning.
&gt; And then we have Teach who is well established as a logia user ++. 

I mean, he's a combination of the most un-logia logia user possible and the "strongest" paramecia fruit.
&gt; This leaves paramecia for Big mom, which I feel is supported by her saliva droplets seen during Fishman Island. At the very least it's not nothing. She has also mentioned her stomach acid.

Did you know that human saliva and stomach juice is *naturally* acidic? Not to the point of Big Mom's but still, it doesn't have to be anything *particularly* unnatural.
&gt; I definitely think the dancing rainbows, grassy Hils, clouds and coffee cups along with everything else are spawned from her ability.

/smiling

Spawned how exactly? What do you imagine?
&gt; Yet she can't eat that stuff, at least based on logic, begging the question whether all that stuff actuality is alive or not.

What definition for "Alive" are you using?
&gt; I think based on what we have atm it's too early to be able to deduce our way to her ability, as I feel like nothing we have seen demonstrates her offensive capabilities.

It is a bit too early to deduce the ability. Yes. I just wanted to hear some guesses.
&gt; If that isn't the case and based on what we have from 786 and before is sufficient to guess, THAT I would want to know.

You haven't missed anything big as far as I can remember, though if you want an extremely low impact hint to keep you guessing, [I've got one here](#s "Big Mom's powers are based off of an English Idiom").
Holy shit!

September 1999.  My parents' mini-van pulls up to my dorm at Rutgers to move me in for my sophomore year.  One of my friends comes running out - "We got ethernet!  They wired the building!"  Rutgers had a 5 year plan to wire all the dorms for high-speed internet (pre wi-fi days) and ours wasn't even on the list.  Except . . . it was!

Even better, Napster had just come out around the same time.  Search for a song, download it in seconds!  It was hilarious to watch the download speed rocket up to 1000k/s.  Before that it could take half an hour to download a song.  

I really can't think of a similarly dramatic leap in technology in the past 10-15 years.  Maybe HDTV become standard.  Maybe once VR leaves the early adopter phase in another year or two.  But I don't think anything is going to beat a 200x increase in internet speed.
Crowd is booing the fuck out of it 😂😂

World War 2 was beneficial to the US because it was essentially a huge deficit spending government program. And since we were fighting overseas, we didn't have to deal with much collateral damage on our home turf.
That and baiting out a Waste.  Nothing says "Waste Me" like having one Volcanic and one Mountain, U/R can easily do something like Fireblast+PoP in response then drop the second Volcanic on t3 and keep rolling.  But that relies on having the second Volcanic.

That made me laugh. It's curious though. Its not the first time someone has suggested that. 

Good luck. Some people are artistic as fuck and can create Amazing things for their SO. I cant do that. I'm just good with my hands fixing stuff and at improvising. Stick with what you know, I say.

Before the Chuunin Exams, Sasuke insulted her and she took it out on Naruto.

After the Pain Arc, she punched Naruto for saving the village.

I'm also remember when she hit Naruto when he and Konohamaru were competing with their seduction techniques.

That's just off the top of my head. There are more examples.

"I havent tried it, but i am sure it sucks because someone else has done something that REASSEMBLES it"

As someone once said:

"Try to get a better understanding of things before you make your judgement"

Now stop being such a whiner over ww2, vietnam, or cold war, because you and I both know that those topics have NOTHING new to offer, and people like you would still whine that it is not what battlefield is about. Besides, you dont even know what battlefield is all about.

Thanks! I noticed everything you pointed out while I was drawing it too, but I figured I was being too OCD. I have a tendency to overwork my art, so I tried not too dwell on the little mistakes. The fact that someone noticed them though,  means I should not be as loose as I was!

I believe the manifold changed from TBI to MPFI around those years.  I can't say exactly what year though.   The MPFI manifolds (later ones anyways) have the plenum issue and early 90's 5.2s don't.

Thanks, I tried it a couple times before but I must have either put a space or something that made it didn't work.^^^^^^^thanks.
     
     
Does that mean I^^^^^(can do this?) nope. I cannot. How do you do it in a sentence all that small? Or can you not? I could have sworn you could.
I had a crown that that fell out (after less than 5 years).  Only to find out the tooth in front had cracked and would need a root canal as well... 

First he says he can't put the crown back on because my teeth shifted?? I don't know about that. He would have to get a mold for a new one... ok... but shouldn't be just do a bridge since the tooth in front needed a root canal as well? He assured me that 2 crowns was the solution. 

I've always been able to feel dental work a little bit even though they numb me, but I just suffer a bit for the few minutes they are drilling.  

Well this time was no different.  I felt the drilling.  He stopped working and gave me a second shot,  waited like 10 minutes and started working again.  

NOPE. Still feel it. So I get shot #3. Wait.  He starts working again.  I. STILL. FEEL. IT. This time he tells me that he's almost done,  just bear with it. So I do. 

The problem is he was not almost done.  He worked on me for another half hour.  I felt EVERYTHING. Tears and snot was running down my face.  I was sobbing and screaming.  Squeezing the chair arms.  Kicking my feet... 

I was so drained when he finally finished I don't know how I made it home.  My SO had never seen me like that and I gave birth to our 5 children...

I had to ice it and take antibiotics. I was sore for over a week.  So I thought the worst of it was over.  I go back so he can take measurements.  

He takes an xray for the insurance company. Comes back into the room and says that he cracked the tooth down by the root and I would now need posts. (Extra $$$)

Oh and he said I should just do a bridge because the teeth are next to each other.  

Really?! 

Then he claims I needed a third root canal.  

I noped the fuck out of there.  I had the rest of the work done at a different dentist (who was a pleasure and I didn't feel anything) and no I didn't need the 3rd root canal! I'm thinking I didn't need the second either.

I don't think that there's much you can do unless you actively see someone in possession, or using said substance.  There's obviously a significant homeless population, many of those people have some sort of mental instability.  Whether they are tweaking, mental unstable, or both, you probably can't do much unless you see them doing something illegal.  Being crazy or annoying isn't illegal, harassing people or openly using drugs is.

Haha i have a bus plan from FL there and back so dont need to worry about that, but the group im going with wont tell me their "plans" for me. I was thinking the slogan "its my 21st. Lets get ready to stumble!" Or something fun like that.
I spent weeks deranking because of the sick amount of blatant wallers/ legit players (being pulled down) in the highest middle ranks, unable to reach GE because MM ranks were bugged. Then they fixed MM and I have literally spent a month trying to undo all that bad karma I earned. I just ranked up just to get into a +right no kick match where we were literally better than the other team but constantly down 2 players. Welcome to the new MM. Hope you enjoy the stay!

It's always good to start with a maquette in clay of some sort. Doesn't matter what kind of clay, water based, oil based, polymer clay, whatever you like working in. You can work out problems and change things that would be un-fixable in stone. There are lots of tutorials online both stone carving and clay working. Trophy basses for are not very good carving stone and are pretty small. Don't be afraid to go bigger. Stones about the size of a watermelon are I think easier to work on and more room to change or fix parts of your project. Look on line for stone sources near you. Many sculptors start on softer stones like soapstone. Find a stone yard and talk to the supplier about what you're doing and what your budget is. Sculpture is a very satisfying pursuit. Good luck and pm me if you like.

Personally I wanted to broker peace between all the factions. If I could have actual options to leverage my character's influence to de-radicalize the factions that should be smart enough anyway to work together instead of making the wasteland more shitty, this would please me. Currently I don't like any of them for one reason or another. I'd rather be fighting something that had a perverse logic on progress that lead it to be a real existential threat to everyone like The Master, at least over this weak facade of moral greyness covering up the fact that I don't have agency in my game even though I'm le super badass. Just finding a reason to kill kill kill shouldn't be the only power fantasy option in the game.
Epic work putting this together, nice work fellow pede'.
no I just pay attention to what is going on and I am not a mark. If you really think KO, Finn, and zayn will get over with the causal fans you are just a dumb mark. The reason why the rock got over because he was built, good looking, athletic, and can talk. Look at NXT no one is over there, just because 500 people chant your name does not mean you are over. Overall no one in wwe is really that talented compared to the guys in the past. They are horrible workers, when I watch the current product I feel like I am watching a staged fight and I do not believe in the product.
They arent refugees or a race though. Refugees are women, children, and the elderly fleeing war. Not military age men from Somalia. Islam is an ideology not a race, to assume muslim = brown would be racism.

Years ago, when I first started working in retail, I was working the checkout in a supermarket and a dad came through with his two kids. We got to the payment and he paid by card and I asked him if he wanted any cash back. The kids' eyes widened as they both simultaneously thought they had discovered the secret King of "get rich quick" schemes and they both (fruitlessly) began imploring their dad to "get a million pounds! Dad! DAAAD! GET A MILLION POUNDS!!!"

Don't put early points in Q outside of Level 1 (or 2 if you are playing with Xayah/your level 1 is vastly greater) - its value comes from the healing it provides. Max W. Basically, you are looking to keep your ADC topped off with Q (and the occasional shield) and threaten with W. He plays very similarly to Alistar in the early game. Wait for your enemy to use a cooldown, and that's when you are seriously looking to W, auto+Q (or if you can, Q+W into auto) and E out when they are looking to retaliate.

The aim of your game early should be to threaten a trade that ends very poorly for them, and then just act as sustain. Even with Coin, you still have plenty of kill threat if the enemy uses 1 CD incorrectly.

For example: you are Rakan+Tristana playing against Thresh+Vayne. Thresh tosses out his Q and misses (~13s CD) and Vayne uses her Q shortly after to get a CS. That means tumble is on a ~5s CD, and Thresh is without hook - look for a trade onto Vayne (or even Thresh, preferably Vayne) with W+Q+Auto in order to proc Thunderlords. Dash out when you believe Vayne's Q to be back off CD (unless you can kill, of course). Continue to wait for trade opportunities, abusing enemy CDs. In the meantime, you should be fishing with Q's for sustain and poke (because you have coin meaning you have infinite mana sustain).

Hope this helps.
One can hope.
RX Vega seems to be a beast to mine Monero

My parents told me that when i was around 4 years old. I had an asthma attack in the middle of the night, never had one before so it was a surprise. The only reason i didn't choke while sleeping was because my mom is a really light sleeper.  i was rushed to the ER after she woke up and got 5 shots in the stomach so i could start breathing again.
Roland couldn't help but feel bad for the woman. While it was true that he still hated House Grafton passionately, her death must have come violently since she was still young. A ruling woman in this time had it hard enough without having to worry about a knife in the night or however she actually died. Roland said nothing, though, and simply shifted in his chair as Jasper continued onto different matters.
No doubt the MK2S is a higher quality printer overall, but thats not saying the CR-10 is bad.

The construction is solid, print quality is just about par none to any other printer at its price point, build size just the same. 6-10 hours is honestly nothing, most Ive seen on the FB group for the creality was 9 days so far, someone just recently started a 6 day a few hours ago.

Both machines are solid choices, really just depends on how much you want to spend, and if you want that extra print space.
Well you gotta look at it like 80 fire ants versus one tarantula. Sure, in a one on one the tarantula would destroy. But all 80? No way, he would be lucky to escape alive.

Ideally, the IS-6 should move up in BR. I feel the IS-6 does fine in at top tier anyways. Behaves like a faster IS-3. Not sure if gaijin would like making a 7.3 premium. IIRC that's max RP/SL modifier for a heavy tank. IS-6 is already a SL printer and adding max modifiers, phew.

Well, the other guy did, which you failed to take into account in your response. So.

He knows how it feels because his cock has, presumably, *been in one.* It's a direct response to half of pretty_sheep's supposition. 

Heck, for all we know he's deepthroated someone's cock that's approximately the same size and curve as his own, so he REALLY knows both ends. Your comment just didn't make much sense and came off as calling him a liar for having claimed to have been deepthroated before.
Thanks for the review, Andrew Rowe.

&gt; I feel as if I haven't had the chance to really get to know the setting in a physical sense, but that's due to the scope of the first book. I imagine subsequent titles will involve more exploration if the ending is any indication.

Definitely. Barely scratching the surface so far. 

&gt; What's more, it isn't all laid out even in the vaguest sense: there's clearly more going on outside of the literal bubble (well, dome) SAM takes place in. 

Heh. Apt.

&gt; His relationship with his ex-retainer, Sera, is one that I hope persists moving forward—whether for better or worse. They seemed to jive well. The same goes for Jin.

Expect more of both of them in the sequel.

&gt; I didn't really connect with Corin, and found his wit usually fell flat, but I'm very hard to please on that front. 

That's because of a defect that occurred in the cloning factory. I'm so sorry.

Which one of us was cloned with the terrible sense of humor? That's a mystery.

&gt; All that considered, I most enjoyed Patrick and Marissa.

Definitely will be giving both of them more screen time in the next book as well.

&gt; I don't like academy settings, schools, or what have you. But I wasn't all that bothered by it in SAM.

Cool.

&gt; More than anything, the Tower and mock-Tower sessions were a blast.

I love those, too.

&gt; I'm disappointed that there was no mention of two Towers touching, maybe the Towers themselves having a sword fight.

Sounds like I need to work on that for the sequel.

&gt; Hmm. I was wondering exactly how far a person can advance—whether it's possible that some of the visages are actually humans from the old world.

Great question.
What wheels (besides white zombas because i'm not a millionare) do you think look best on a heatwave endo? I almost have enough keys for heatwave and am looking to upgrade wheels next. 

I like all of your presets though, 1,3,4 I like the most with the green zomba one (2) as my least favorite
For some reason, the second CPU core BIOS option locks you at 2.2GHz at whatever voltage you set, so that's what the problem was.

I don't know, is it unethical when the police take a drug dealers money and use it to buy a police vehicle?

It's nice to have libertarian\anarchist values, but we're trying to run a society here, and the addicts dying every day and contributing nothing to the economy definitely shouldn't have the loud voice in the room.
Sorry not a manlet. Perhaps you should eat more spinach.
Yeah I know not everyone did -- some people have argued with me about this -- that's what drove me to put this post together.
Or just keep hitting him with your weapon as you dodge his shit fire. Never taking damage because he can't land a fireball on anything. With magic at least you can spam spells, but they don't do much damage.

Have fun! Serrell in particular is one of my favorite museum books of all time.
Thanks :D
&gt;The Holy Roman Empire was mostly just the German-speaking parts of Europe. Charlemagne was the first Holy Roman Emperor but his dyansty ended up ruling France. In this, the King of France is the Emperor too. Two of the most powerful factions were united.
Is it misleading? Clickbaity, maybe, but it's not misleading...
Except NEETs are poor and aristocrats are rich
Well, the difference between Maia and Woodley is that Maia just didn't have the skills to do any more than he did. His one path to victory was completely shut down by Woodley. Many people feel that Woodley did have the skills to do more, but chose not to, although a lot of the backlash happened before it came out that Woodley had torn his labrum. 

I can't say I found the fight entertaining, but I also can't fault Woodley for following the game plan that maximized his chances for victory. I'll still tune in to watch his fights, cause even if they aren't entertaining in the moment, I always look back and am like, "damn, he's got some impressive skills."

Whether it's possible or not, it's extremely inappropriate to suggest that in a customer/supermarket employee exchange. This isn't the type of conversation anyone wants to have while at work.

This show has been delivering so far.
Physical and financial is a C-. My impulse control sucks, I lack career stability, and under earn most of my friends. Physically, I'm overweight and don't exercise enough but I'm making better food choices.

My antidepressant is working well, I have great friends, fun hobbies, and a loving SO. If things go well, I can get a better grade for the top 2.

I'd say that Gunnar Nelson, Paddy Holohan and Aisling Daly are clearly UFC level.

They aren't top 10 fighters, but they are good fighters that came up through the gym. They have a couple younger fighters working their way up on the regional circuit also. That's a decent number of fighters to come out of a relatively young MMA gym (compared to AKA, Jackson Winkeljohn and the other super gyms).
Interstellar, when McConaughey returns from the planet and his daughter has aged many years. I have a daughter and for some reason that really gets to me.
Micropenis?
I'm 29. As you get older it's about the STRATEGY and getting the tactical advantage.
Going in soon for another two stents. And a third after about a month rest.  All of this trying to avoid open heart surgery.  Good times.
Should be dead by then... Good luck with our mess grandkids and thanks for all the fish!!!
Which is why tourists might as well be on railroad tracks. they have handlers and only go to specific places. Almost everyone they meet at all, and everyone they're allowed to interact with, is employed specifically to do so.
He recently had an English-speaking part in HBO's Girls. I didn't actually watch it though so I don't know how big it was.
I like to complete everything so I have all 3 &amp; the dlc to all 3. Start with 1 &amp; the dlc is completely worth it, bl2 &amp; all the dlc is worth it as well but tps was a bit of a let down but I got it all anyways because I'm a bit of a completionist

That thing is a pain in the ass to assemble. It's sitting on my dining table in 5 big pieces because it can't handle the force you need to put it together
I agree. This thing won't flinch when it comes to turning a 36mm axle nut though. I've sat for minutes blasting a nut with a 3/4" drive pneumatic gun. That was before I snapped 3 24" breaker bars with cheater bars. My dad was PISSED.
What kind of father would willingly let his son dress up a female?

Sabertooth, I'm disappointed.
I want that as my text notification sound.
Depending on how people do their rows, if they do 4 of the same element you can get by with about 1 reflect and 2 Def spheres per round. Pretty good if you have viable units to use reflect otherwise probably expect to spend ~5 def spheres per row.
So the chat's as shitty as I figured it would be. Not sure how people who watch this on Youtube are even going to be able to read it, it's scrolling at the speed of light, even with the 170-second Slow Mode. Have fun with that, Youtube viewers.

I came in a little late, but overall, it wasn't as great as I had hyped myself for it to be. Franz (A German Spy), as /u/Arontala put perfectly, *"lectures rather than explains,"* and that hurts the conversations as a whole for me. Especially-so when he continually gets cut off but continually tries to interject instead of just waiting. I can't remember the sentence he wanted to get in, but I listened to him repeat the first ~3 words at least a dozen times. He just doesn't fit the format, in my opinion. It doesn't help that there's already four other people trying to get their bit in.

***

I read (and have somewhat seen) that Woolie's basically being told where to go, what to do, and how to do it. That's kind of disappointing. I was expecting *"I'ma just run through here--OH SHIT!"* Y'know? A *"true"* Souls game experience.

***

The audio's fucking terrible at times. Apparently there was some issues earlier, but Christ, the volume on their mics seems to be fluctuating so much (would make sense if they were moving away from the mic...but they're not). Franz is a bit loud, but not terrible.

I find it funny that Matt's individual stream on...I think it was Saturday the 23rd, barring the technical issues at the start, was *much* stronger than this one.
Thank you for that, I guess I needed to hear that. its tough to hear sometimes the thought of ending engagement especially since its my second time, its not easy.
We're all fucked up...
Definitely.  Honestly, this was a hard one to evaluate but the Capella SB also works good as a RW because if you have a weapon with a status proc (name Zidane's Butterfly Sword with Silence), then the RW has a chance to land that proc.

Thanks, I'm watching /r/eve every single second of my life
First I admitted it was possible the Earth was a bit older than 6000 years...then the dam burst.
illegal yes, but i mean i dont see cops outside doing anything.....my doc advised against a card because it affects insurance claims etc.

I mean this sucks. I go through maybe a gram a month. I stay out of public and i just want to chill out sometimes. why the hell should i still have to worry.
While Seth is wearing his burn it down shirt.
Thank you for providing those links and explanation. I think I was confused about the term before and had the wrong connotations, and that helped me understand your point more clearly.

Wrong! I want to go All Day without someone asking me a question...
Ikr?! Part of why we found it so funny :P
The group of people I associate with is a very... odd bunch. We've done things like counting coup, bareknuckle boxing, wrestling of both Greco Roman and olympic types.
VP like?
There's something I like about "If Crash appears, I'll buy orbs."

Like, I just buy orbs because of emotions getting the best of me when I don't pull a unit. I far prefer the method of random shit appearing, so I'll buy for random shit to appear. It's a lot more in the likeness of summoning itself.
Why bother? As hard as it is, don't invest in men who aren't showing you interest and pursuing you in ways that make you happy. 

Continue to date other men and ignore this one. Chances are, he won't be worth it, but time will tell.
yea but it was the police chief who said it
He is running the business side of it. Doesn't work like Madden, people need to get paid, and there needs to be cash flow, and he has done a good job at that.

Go to fucking lunch with her. She wants to help you. 

Consider a video game where you see a spirit wolf in the woods and it tells you to follow it. 

Follow the spirit wolf and report back tomorrow.
I'm at this game. Crowd is so lifeless compared to the games I watched at Roger's Centre earlier in the week. Guess you can't blame them.

I too do this but I'm just morbidly curiously. It's fascinating how real monsters wear the masks of men.
I had to use it for about a month as a daily driver in November 2015, with the CM11 rom from XDA. I had to use no more than one app per time, 80% of the time it was 100% falling behind when writing on the keyboard, and sometimes I had to wait minutes for Whatsapp to open.

But some other times it had something like 30 seconds of complete smoothness with Nova Launcher and full Lollipop like animations.

"I live my life just one app at a time. For those 30 seconds or less, I am free."
I told everyone I was wearing a pantsuit with a train. After everyone resigned themselves to it, then I sprung my beautiful dress on them! Take it or leave ir, it's our day and I want us to be comfortable. I would have married him in a burlap sac if I needed too.

It's likely that your CPU cooler is not sitting correctly on the CPU and past the bios there is more heat generated and once it gets to a point it will freeze in an effort to prevent the frying of the CPU. Take the cooler off, reapply the thermal paste and make sure that you don't put too much on. If you do it can actually do the opposite and insulate the CPU. Put it back together and watch the temps. If your CPU goes past 100 Celsius then there is something wrong.
Pack-pack, pack-pack,

I'm the pack-pack loaded up,

Anything that you might need,
I've got it packed for you.

Pack-pack, pack-pack,

Not enough tiger belly.
I've felt like this for the last ten years though (that's half my life) so I don't see it getting better. That's half my reasoning for it. Like I don't just feel this way because of big BPD emotions, I feel this way all the time, especially when I'm thinking logically, it just seems like the only thing that makes sense. I'm just worried the BPD emotions will make me act on it.

I made a post here the other day about how I went to the doctor and I went under the guise that I was having trouble sleeping (which I do have trouble sleeping) but I really just wanted her to give me sleeping pills so I could use them to kill myself (though that's not my preferred method, my 2 most preferable methods are unavailable to me right now so I just wanted to have a back up in case I needed to so it suddenly).

I don't know what I want to be honest. I'm trying to figure that out. I think I just want a reason to live and I can't find that anywhere.
Trump is Trump. He will attack with anything. The problem is that Hillary has much more to attack.

Bernie is a open-handed politician. There's little we don't know about him already. Trump would have to fight Bernie with policy and numbers, with Hillary he can use many examples of her personal and political failings.

She apparently thinks she's gansta.
It's not even getting about high upside players, it's about getting value.  Lynn even as a rental is worth more than a 2/3 round compensation pick.   If Lynn had been traded for 2-3 decent prospects, that offers more value than a 2-3 round compensation pick.  Those 2-3 prospects offer more flexibility and total value into the future.  They could all be shipped off in separate trades or perhaps one of them develops into a player.   Now, it's either resign Lynn and potentially damage the chances of adding another high-salaried player as well as create a block against any other current Cardinal pitching prospect, or lose him for a 2-3 sandwich pick.  Either way, I think the Cardinals have already lost on a move that could've been better in the long run had it been made.   It's over.  That opportunity is now gone.
&gt;Sure, but companies like Bethesda and Valve can bankroll titles with their own cash reserves.

Superhot surpassed their Kickstarter goal (which included VR support) by $150,000 and made a ton of money beyond that, some of it from people expecting VR based on the VR goal (and I believe not getting it; Oculus keys only went to kickstarter backers, not prior buyers, if I understand right).
I guess Asian players don't mash very often, because mashing jab completely blows up all of those Cammy setups that Poongko was a getting away with. 

As a matter of fact, mashing jab gets you out of hooligan setups and just taking the throw in this beta was beta than trying to tech Cammy due to the fact the her throws toss the opponent too far away AND they recover too fast from them to get any setups off of them.
Yeah, I've said some dumb stuff while I'm salty so I get it. Thanks for taking meh criticism well tho. Your point that most non teamers get taken out by teamers is really accurate though. Supercell needs to do something...
I wouldn't past them that she used  his cheating as a socially acceptable excuse

Weighing in on Grand Rapids, MI. I live just outside the city and love it. Very reasonable - you could easily live on $2K/month and not have to sacrifice, lots to see and do, good eating, a good amount of transport jobs and, most importantly, one of the friendliest places I've lived (and I've moved around a lot). Welcome to the US!
e-dicks are always NSFW.
Yeah man no worries
No, that's just Xenuria.
Communion is about remembering what Christ did for us and the new covenant we have with God, I don't see any thing other than that in Scripture.
Dont listen to these POG bitches.
Since you keep saying the past is worthless, which is retarded but ok. Daigo's Guile is the 2nd best in the world in results. Only better guile is the 2016 capcom cup champion. Him and many other top players, including tokido (the most recent evo champion) have been very vocal about shit fighter v. You're losing grip of reality dude.
Brigading kinda means "inciting another group to alter the upvotes or downvotes through direct linking and a cause"

What it really means is "Posting a link to another sub while not being in favor of the admins."

Read, SRS and Brigading.
Or, y'know... A sequel?
So these meetings are mandatory, but unnecessary? Maybe you could work out with your manager a one-on-one meeting so you can bypass these bigger meetings, without completely missing out on having meetings to check in. They really need to be working with you on this, I think, because it probably falls under the Americans with Disabilities Act in terms of accommodation.
Yeah I just recently started using the tornado in my deck as I have been looking for a viable replacement for zap for a while. After a day of using it I was losing matches but recognized the potential. I dropped 800 trophies due to this shit but I stuck with it. I've gained back 500 and feel unstoppable. Even games I lose, most of them I feel I've lost because I didn't place my tornado properly or place it at the right time.  But when I do get it right, in the right scenario, there is nothing more satisfying and impressive than executing this card in the way you imagine you want to.

Ok. I wasn't sure what you were exactly asking with your post &gt;.&lt;

Every couple days there's a post from someone who wants to buy a $2000 PC and quit their job to begin a life of streaming. I thought this was one of those.

That and people who get donations/subs and "forget" to pay taxes are probably 2 of the biggest pitfalls of Twitch.
"As a server I make $2.18/hr which goes entirely to taxes."

So if it weren't for tips, you'd be making literally 0 dollars?
If a job's hiring someone full time, now, they probably need someone to work full time, now. Find something part time and see if you can work your way up. Work on your app and internships and see how much you can get done before graduation. If you keep applying for full time work you may eventually get someone to agree, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be this far in advance. 4 months is a lot.

Its a great podcast to listen to while driving or just chilling. I listen to playing games. I like it because its the perfect amount, 4-4.5 hours, every week. It has great hosts, great guests and the production quality is top notch.

RSK for life!
Drown.
That would seem fair if this were on mobile.
I love George! People often forget how great he was. He's so underrated.
Thank you soo much, I really really appreciate it! This is super helpful &lt;3
Where's your kid?
Damn.
Yup you sure can. You can even put a voluntary down payment down in store and pay all but like $25 of it off at that point. Can't use the gift card on it though. Otherwise you typically need to wait for your first bill with the phone on it, then you can pay it all off.

I should also add as I was apologizing she started to curse me out and say "watch what you're doing you douche!" So I didn't feel THAT bad for her
And all over Facebook I see "the reason Leo hasn't won an Oscar." Bunch of anal fissures...
Im glad that you reported it. i salute you for your bravery :)
You know I have been debating whether or not to respond to this for a few days, and I think I will express my opinion.  

Pointholds don't make you better players individually.  In fact it's the opposite of what would actually make you a better player because you end up sticking in one spot for a large part of the fight and well you don't learn positioning from that at all.
Blitzing is the only thing us SU have. We just don't have the longevity yet.

I stand by what I said.
Maybe it is. :)
Overall he's a good professor. Great lecturer, hes very passionate about what he teaches so you'll notice him go on tangents if people ask questions about something he's interested in, I found funny imo. GET READY TO READ, politics in general is a heavy reading major but holy shit Eaton makes you read about 50-100 pages for each lecture, so make sure you stay on top of your reading because catching up is a bitch. His exams are relatively easy as long as you go to lecture, do your reading and study the study guide. Eaton gives you everything that will be on the exam on the study guide before so take advantage of that because most professors don't even study guides. ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MSI/LSS IT FORCES YOU TO STAY ON TOP OF YOUR READING/GET HELP WITH ESSAYS AND GIVES YOU AN EXTRA 2 PERCENT FOR YOUR GRADE. Overall hes a good professor and a good into to poltics classes in general.
will people ever use the search function?
Yep. All marvel movies will be based here at pinewood studios going forward
Holy shit this was an amazing issue. Really good on its own as well
My Chemical Romance. Bye, Metallica. Substitute MCR for band of your choice, always disband Metallica. Easy.
I've got a weird story for this. I was 14 the first time I masturbated (incidentally, on Father's Day of that year). A couple times during the months leading up to that first time, I had wet dreams. I didn't know that was a thing, so I got scared because I thought it was pee, and that I had a UTI.

One night, I just decided to try it out, because I was horny and bored. I didn't actually know it was common practice to use some sort of lubricant, so I just did it dry (feels pretty good in a different way, actually). It was definitely the best, most satisfying orgasm I've ever had while masturbating
Here are the places I have been looking -

www.utsavfashion.com - I ordered from here and was happy but the shipping did take a while

www.aishwaryadesignstudio.com

www.g3fashion.com - I ordered from here recently and they have great customer service including video chat where you can ask to see all the detail up close. The outfit came really quickly even with them altering the outfit. I do need to have the blouse taken in though, and it's slightly lopsided but the dress maker will be able to fix it.

Would love to know who people recommend for wedding outfits. It's too expensive for me to travel for my wedding outfits so I'm looking online.
Slow, steady, and full of people complaining :P
In pro wrestling that's still clean
I didn't study or prepare for it in anyway.
It is just a primary that is done a little differently.  It is only important because it is first.
All should be in August will link you!

Wow, the Bismark sunk your grandmother?

That's rough, buddy.

(I'm sorry, I had to)
8Ks without his stuff
I recommend:  
Be Prepared! (Really good pictures, aimed at dads but i really liked it)  
Wonder Weeks  
Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn  

More way of life/child developmentish:  
Bringing Up Bebe  
Danish Way of Parenting  
Importance of Being Little
I prefer the man they call Jayne
I love Corey Graves
Southern Oklahoma and horrible...we're about to build a water well for that exact reason. It's bad enough that it gained Erin Brockovich's attention.
Well, I mean those responses were directly against something they read as anti-trans, and hateful. So I wouldn't say 'just a joke', but it's contextualized. 

-- letting off steam - yes, I would say that is what it is in that instance; 

and I never said 'a few bad eggs', i.e maybe that could be said about Sojourner_truth's link to examples, but I never ever see things like that called out in the trans community - and I've been searching for opinion peices, just in comments, etc. and I take issue with that - no excuses sort of thing

Find a planet made of gold and then bring it all back to make gold worthless.
For a few weeks it seemed like new accounts were randomized on point levels (some even 775 points with gold), but lately it has gone back to normal.

As far as being worth it, it's up to you. No longer can you just set it and forget it. You really do have to babysit these accounts now, and try to simulate natural human behavior.  But if you are just sitting on your ass watching TV, you might as well! Even if you play by the rules and only have 5 accounts, you can still get $25 every 20 or so days. Good if you have a video game habit, or wanna beef up your vinyl collection etc.

There used to be a girl at my school with the last name Baby. It's not as bad as having it as a first name, but I imagined how awkward it must be for her family when they're trying to introduce themselves, and as a result I couldn't keep in my laughter. Pretty sure she hates me now.

Why is so much of this status unneeded? That they mentioned the job interview implies there should be some sort of reaction from the interviewer. Since there isn't, it's just a waste of space. Stop pretending you aren't a narcissist and just make a self-fellating status telling everyone about your mental illnesses. At least then I couldn't call you a 'dishonest' cretin.

I immediately took it as option three. The fact that, to you, it was perceived to be the least likely, I think does some to shed some light on this controversy. I don't mean that in the pejorative; I'm not saying, "The fact that you saw it this way just goes to show..." something demeaning about you and people that post there, no, that's not what I mean here. I think this genuinely gets at the root of where the conflict comes from, and it's all down to perception of intent. When I myself phrase something like Tyson did in that quote, I'm trying to illustrate in extremely granular detail what it is that is happening, on a phenomenological level. I'm trying to break it's *normalcy*. We accept unreasonable things mostly due to the "tyranny of the default", a term in user interface development to indicate how which ever way the programmer pre-configured the application, 99% of users will leave it that way, and this applies to most other areas of our lives as well. Pointing out in such granular detail helps to illustrate how *ridiculous* it is, and hopefully, begins to shatter the illusion we've been lulled into accepting "because why would it be any other way?"

You read it in a manor that suggests... I'm not sure "contempt" is the right word, but close to that sentiment. Definitely suspicion. An incredulous bias that the speaker is being disingenuous with their motives, or engaging in some other kind of obscurantism. I don't want to make assumptions about you, but if I did, I might ask if you'd had experiences in the past of having to be suspicious of people due to their language? I'm not trying to project anything on you, I'm just trying to find a commonality between you and others who interpret things this way. I really do think it all comes down to an issue of perceived intent that doesn't match that of the speaker.

Either way, I'd love to hear anything thoughts you might have about it, if you're not immediately adversarial to the idea of self reflection. I dismiss /r/iamverysmart users for anti-intellectualism but I may be disparaging them unfairly myself, and if that's the case, I think *understanding* eachother better is the first step to coming together.

Thank you so much for your input.  I am more confused than ever now though.  I never want to offend anyone but someone else chimed in also and found it offensive.  What are your thoughts on how the majority of deaf people feel about this?  And how do I refer to people who are not all the way deaf, if not h _ _ _ ing impaired?
Because a traditional bulk/cut is fairly hands off, whereas most professionals have to be incredibly tuned into their diets.

Hi there, TA of fundies 1 here.

As a counter point to the parent post, here's why I think you should consider Fundies 1:

* You want a more thoughtful/nuanced look at "programming". Many intro classes focus squarely on the mechanics of programming, without focusing on the elegant solutions that from a set of core, high-level primitives. Fundies does that well.
* You are willing to learn a language, even if it's not used in the "real" world. A surprising number of people don't see the merits in learning a language that they will never be paid to do, especially if it challenges their traditional way of thinking.

Why you **shouldn't** take fundies:

* You already know a functional or ML based language (Rust does not count)
* You want to learn to program from the perspective of a software engineer, not as a computer scientist.
* You care about your GPA
I'm guessing it's either Heavy Metal or Punk.

When I ask that gym position be assigned based on prestige contributed it's for three reasons.

1. A gym is a highscore board from 1-10. Currently a noobs level 28 Gyarados can "beat" the highscore of my level 40 Slowbro. Gym battles are arcadey action, I like the idea of seeing my stuff in the top spot if I add the most prestige like getting the #1 spot on Galaga88 in an arcade and carefully selecting DAV or whatever your 3 letter nick was.

2. I want to put in what I consider a powerful mon without getting kicked out or hurting the gym. So currently I put in my 2400cp Confusion/Ice Beam Slowbro. Ok, I will almost certainly be on the bottom and the first to be shaved off. Not only that, assuming I've prestiged 5 open slots.. Now what? A bunch of annoyed trainers have to take it from level 6 to level 10 against a super annoying to prestige mon. I'm probably more likely to be shaved off JUST so they can prestige more easily. I've had that happen with one of my bottom Blissey.. Someone couldn't be bothered spending twice as long to get 500xp so they simply shaved it off and prestiged up another 3-4 spots against their karp which they then alt booted too.

3. It stops me being shaved off. Sorry shaver, I put 10k in to bring it up from level 9 to 10, you're going to have to do the same or better to take me off, not knock a single mon and prestige it up 1000.

The current situation is what is called "The Tragedy Of The Commons". Essentially, everyone works in their own selfish interests even if they know it's worse in the long run because everyone else is doing the same and anyone acting selflessly is just taken advantage of. My local meta is my local meta, me tearing a gym down and opening spots doesn't change that, it gives me zero real control over what I put in the gym and probably actively harms the gym if I put in the low CP non traditional defenders because my teammates won't know how to deal with them. Now there is nothing wrong with being selfless and opening up spots. I've taken my team through the easiest gym building strats. I've taken them out on karp hunting trips, told them to look for the old bubblers, the new bubblers, I often leave my karp or bubbler at the bottom of a gym (I only have one account) just to help the team out. The alternative is putting a Gary or a Arcanine in as an easy prestiger. That is all good practice for being a selfless team leader. It's got zero to do with the benefits of killing shaving by ordering a gym by prestige and being able to put my annoying defenders at the top of a gym instead of a Gary or Dragonite.
I have an electric pressure cooker so it isn't an option, but it has great safety features and it won't get above a certain temp so I don't have to baby sit it while cooking. I remember about 20 years ago my little brothers girlfriend was cooking corned beef and it was massive so she cut it into 3 pieces and used different pots. One pot was an old pressure cooker and she set the lid on top but didn't turn it or secure it, thinking it would just be a cover. When she touched the handle the lid blew off like a bomb, filling the kitchen with steam and bending the range hood nearly in half. She had minor burns, but she also scalded her eyeball. Luckily my cousin is an eye doctor so he treated her free of charge.
Sure, just anything in game would be fine

&gt; 30k-40k a year, 10% of that persons disposable income for 20 years is nothing relative to the 40k-70k that they borrowed.

Let's see: 10% of 30k/year is 3k/year. For 20 years, that's 60k. I'd say that's pretty close to the amount that they borrowed. Considering that incomes are likely to rise with career advancement, inflation, etc, this means that yes, there is a good chance that the banks will get their money back with interest.
No problem buddy!

Sounds great, but also like it'd definitely be something to consider after release. I believe it's been said that suggestions for the mod will be taken when a stable public version of the mod is available.

If we're talking about things we'd like to see in the future, however, your second paragraph made me remember a suggestion I was going to make myself. 

Personally, I'd like there to be a plugin for Mumble and Teamspeak's positional audio feature included in the mod. Something that tracks if players are near each other in the same cell, or possibly even behind walls and closed doors. That'd be nifty as frick. :-)

You just missed the 1080 deal, it's currently out of stock. It might come back in stock however, so just keep checking? Once Vega news hit, it started selling like hot cakes.

&gt;That's not specific to /r/Science - a lot of subreddits use a rule like this. If someone has negative karma, it's extremely likely that they're either a troublemaker or an outright troll - that's probably how they got downvoted in the first place. 

Yup, I've implemented the rule a couple years ago on some subs I used to mod... but they weren't defaults.  It was to get rid of dedicated trolls.  

I've never modded a default, but being these subs are the entry point to reddit seems like the wrong place to use it.  Or.. well... maybe seems too strict to me.  Maybe after -5 or whatever... just seems someone not savvy with reddit could easily become an effectively banned commenter for one negative vote.

Set up boundaries, like allowing guests in the living room but not the bedroom/office, and only letting them come over for a couple hours at a time. Spend a certain amount of time being social, but have a way out if you need it (a project you need to get done, family member who needs help, or just tell them you need to rest because you have a headache).

No cushioning. Reduces stability. Your heels won't be experiencing any real impact stress from lifting even with jumping movements like cleans. A more stable base is always better and safer.

Cushioning is great for anything where there is going to be lots of repeated impact like running but it's not going to give you any benefit with the weights.

Also I think cushioned vs minimal may be a debate in the running world but it's not for lifting, its very one sided in favor of a solid shoe.

I'll spot you in horizontal thrusts.
I'm curious if you have any basis for the idea that the officer likely won't show up and the case will be dismissed, beyond common folk knowledge. I'm only challenging you on it because I work in the courts (albeit not in NYC), and police officers (a) get paid overtime to come to court, and (b) get in trouble with their superiors if they do not come to court. Even if they don't show up, the trial is usually just rescheduled for a new date that the cop can make, and now you've missed two days of work instead of one.  

I'm willing to defer to you if you know something about NYC that I don't. But in general, I'd be confident in putting the "the cop won't show up and the case will be dismissed" meme at 90% old wive's tale.
*My name is Valentine Shockley. I have several degrees in Psychology and other social sciences, but no Ph.D. (yet) so I'm not a Dr. However, for several years I was a coroner's assistant and for several others, a therapist, until the War. Through my life experiences, I have become somewhat of a Linguist, speaking English, German, Spanish, Japanese and Greek.*

*Ever since I was about 13 years old, I could hear strange whispers around me. I would catch bits and pieces of conversations that others around me couldn't or wouldn't hear, and when I would ask about them, I wouldn't receive any answers. It soon came to my knowledge that I could hear the thoughts of those around me. Early on, these thoughts were only whispers and a distraction, but soon they became loud. Shouts. Psychic Screams.* 

*When I was 18, I tried to kill myself from the relentless noise of the thoughts of those around me. I slit my throat from ear to ear, and it is a miracle that I'm not dead today. I'm not sure if it was this act or just time that has given me control over the thoughts that used to intrude so violently upon me, but I have been able to direct and control which thoughts I receive. Coupled with my seeming Telepathy, I have gained an almost instant understanding of the emotions of those around me as well, a supernatural Empathy.*  

*When I was 23 years old and working with a Coroner's Lab, I discovered that I could also collect, I'm not sure how to phrase this, but a psychic imprint of sorts, from corpses if I made skin to skin contact with them. This not only told me exactly how the person in question perished, but gave me a general idea of what they were like in their life; what their existence was mainly defined by. To a lesser extent, I have a similar ability with books and literature, provided I understand the language. And by similar, I mean severely limited. If I hold a book for long enough, I am able to learn the contents seemingly by osmosis.*

*These abilities lend a slight advantage in combat, allowing me to know my opponents decisions the instant they make them, and allowing me to react at almost the same time they act. However, I have needed ballistics and other combat training, as knowing how a corpse felt right before they died isn't exactly helpful when somebody is pointing a gun at my head.*

We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I was introduced to sex toys by the infamous Dr. Ruth. I would never have wanted to receive a sex toy from my friggin parents. God. No. But it would have been great if they'd introduced me to dr Ruth. Then maybe I would have asked for one.

I used the recipe out of Tartine's first book, though these weren't anything like theirs.  Actually Tartine's is much denser (which I like) and the flavor is different, but I bet a lot of it had to do with using different butters.  I used 50% Kerigold thinking it would add flavor... which it did but almost to a detriment since Kerigold has a strong and distinctive flavor.  Next time I'll probably try using a different brand to see how they come out (or find out what brand Tartine uses).

Her age in the article says 73.. and according to [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunhild_Larking) she is 81 now..  which is why I said 8 years.. Now, unless you're a complete retard, I felt there is some basis to your 7 years ago claim and I figured it would be based on the published date of January 30, 2010 which I found when I scrolled all the way down..  the article either got her age wrong  or she was interviewed just before her 74th birthday on January 13, 2010.

In XCOM 1, XCOM was a multinational organization.  XCOM was officially sanctioned and funded by governments of different nations.  XCOM was like the United Nations.  So it made sense for XCOM soldiers to wear their country  flags on uniforms to represent their individual countries.

In XCOM 2, your soldiers are resistance fighters.  XCOM is a rogue organization.  It is no longer sanctioned by any government.  XCOM soldiers are wanted outlaws and fugitives.  So it does not make sense for the soldiers to still wear their country flags on their outfits.  It is fine to show a soldier's national origin in his/her profile.  However, putting a country flag on a fighter's outfit seems silly.  It is a legacy implementation that was unnecessarily carried over from the previous game and does not make any sense in the world of XCOM 2.

Wow, I'm 25 and in a 5 year relationship. So to begin *hug* it's ok to not feel strong sometimes. 

Whatever is going on with him has nothing to do with you. He hasn't just dropped all his feelings over night I promise. But whatever it is that's going on with him, you can't fix it, that's up to him. He needs to work on whatever this is himself, and you can't push him into it, no one can. And if he does come back you have to talk about whatever this was, and that it can't happen again.

The thing with relationships is, you're growing as people all the time, and sometimes that growing can change things for the couple. You might align sometimes, but life can change things right? You are going to want to be with someone who can grow with you and when things seem to change they don't just abandon ship, they talk to you, that's a great caring partner to be with. A caring partner would recognize that they have been with this person they love for x amount of time (and other conditions that make being with that person great) and talk to them about what's going on. Hopefully he'll come around on his own, but you deserve a consistently caring partner.

What's most important right now is to remember to focus on loving yourself, whatever he's going through this isn't about you, and you can't fix whatever is going on with him.

No mate, that sounds like something you've been doing to me to be honest. 

I just like the idea of having a portion of this community (the older guys like yourself and myself) promoting reasonable discussion among all the memes. If you don't want to be a part of that, that's fine, but don't expect anyone to have reasonable discussions with you. I assume that's why you even bother posting here isn't it? To discuss CLG and CLG related matters with like minded people?

* There are lots of good reanimator commanders. My favorite is Karador, but be warned! He's incredibly strong and paints a target on your back. If you want to do something a little more chill and zombie-themed, you could always build Grimgrin and go all zombies for lots of great shenanigans. 
* Esper Artifacts is insanely strong. Sharuum is one of the strongest decks out there. Just be careful. If your playgroup doesn't like broken things, you aren't going to make friends playing her. 
* Most people don't play with oversized commander cards. Just leave it at home and play with the real thing. 
* The [Ultra Pro 100+](http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-100-Black-Deck/dp/B0081IRWEU/) deck boxes are cheap, come in a bunch of colors, and work great for your EDH decks. You really don't need to spend $30+ on fancy boxes when these work great for $6. 
* Whatever you end up building, I humbly suggest you read the [Unified Theory of Commander](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/42tdaj/unified_theory_of_commander_synergy_the_theory_is/) to make sure whatever deck you end up building is both fun and functional.

"middle ground" is a term used by the political class to force both sides to compromise on their respective intellectual integrities.  This notion that bisecting the issues is the "solution" is a false choice designed to appeal to the sheeple.  

The only "middle ground" that is honest is to remove the issue from the sphere of influence of government.  There is the myopic preconceived notion that most people are programmed with that says that government must solve problems.  This is too a false choice!  The best way to allow more fairness in politics is to make the political class (e.g. government) less powerful and less intrusive into our freedoms.  Take marriage for example... imagine if governments got out of the marriage business and therefore only churches (or whatever entity) defines their respective definition of marriage.
Gotta add that /s at the end.
It would not, it's region locked
I am saying that the reality of that is to reduce access to low income students through rejecting them for admissions.

By making the marginal cost of attendance at public schools zero for higher income students, you make it more likely they'll attend public schools as opposed to expensive private schools.  Low income students, who can't afford to attend expensive private schools, will find themselves locked out.  And many of the private schools will fail since their subsidies will be going away to pay for public schools, and their paying student base will be shrinking to attend public schools.

If only half of kids can go to college, **there must be some mechanism by which many kids are told "you can't go to college."** That mechanism right now is a combination of money and grades.  What you're proposing is to (in effect) make it just grades, but I think that changes the composition much less than you're thinking it will, while at the same time having adverse consequences elsewhere.

France has a system without tuition or debt, but [that system is highly limiting and reserves admission to quality colleges to a tiny fraction of the population who can pass grueling tests and winnowing.](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/dispatches_from_the_welfare_state/2014/02/higher_education_in_france_lots_of_testing_lots_of_planning_not_lots_of.html)  Free French schools largely end up perpetuating the elite of French society who can guide their kids through the maze of hoops and tests and courses.

People mention the narcomoeba/dread return package, but hermit druid was broken long before either of those cards got printed.
 
The original combo was [[krosan reclamation]], bringing back [[reanimate]] for [[Sutured Ghoul]] with [[dragon breath]] to give it haste.

edit: Actually, the real original combo used Anger over dragon breath (hence why the deck that got hermit druid banned was called "Angry Hermit"), but dragon breath later replaced it, because you didn't have to play a basic mountain.

Edit2: to clarify, angry hermit was an extended deck, original duals were not legal and shocks not yet printed, so basic mountain was the only option.

I think that's a lot more tenuous. In your hypothetical, the candidate is not prohibited from campaigning, and is free to run a write in campaign. While that certainly makes it an uphill battle, the government is not expressly prohibiting speech or preventing the candidate from running a campaign.

I was a little disheartened to read your post. Many people I know feel the way you've felt. Many go home but many stick around, love the city and never wanna leave (myself included).

Here's the deal, like many others have said looks you may live in a not so safe part of LA. From your post I'd gather you live somewhere just east of the 101 in east Hollywood/Thai Town. The area is walkable but not exactly safe. For steady decent paying work have you looked into green tech jobs? The tech industry has grown exponentially in LA with downtown and playa both leading the way. Likewise in many of those fields and tech areas you'll meet people closer to your age. Rent wise living near there isn't cheap but you'll find if you live in areas near the expo line getting to downtown is easy. As for playa try looking in Palms which is probably the last bastion of affordability on the westside. Try hiking, or checking out some nature groups. Join a sports league, take a cooking class. If your friends can't meet up sometime, learn to enjoy being alone. Catch a movie at QTs theater, in this city anything you do, you can and will find like minded individuals.

Like many others, I was in your situation when I first arrived. It took 6 years before I felt comfortable in income to fully enjoy everything. This is the first place in my 31 years that felt like "home."  But compared to many places I've been, and I've traveled the world, few places offer what this city has. There's the descent into LAX at night that even after 14 years still takes my breath away. Beach weather 85% of the year, food and people from all over the world, world class entertainment and nature all within a 2 hour drive.

My advice, it's okay to get discouraged, we all have our bad days. But perseverance is key. If this really is your dream city, explore the possibilities and once your year or so is up, reassess your situation. That way when your settled and have a family, good social network you can look back while living in your home on the beach in Santa Monica or Venice or marina and say "I made it," or you can take solace in knowing you took the plunge and moved to your dream city and ultimately it didn't work out and that's okay. Not everything has a fairy tale ending. But you won't regret anything.

But truly try on your weekends to see LA (not the touristy stuff) but the many hidden treasures and the hole in the wall food spots. There's so much to do and enjoy and taste here that's it's difficult to hate the place imo.

"Weekly" game is approaching three weeks since the last session. Thinking about forming my own group, DMing for the first time. Any advice? Got 3-4 interested players.

In the game, we're still pretty low level. Hit level 3 end of last session. As a pathfinder conversion Eberron Artificer, this level gives me some pretty versatile casting ability (any 1st level arcane/divine spell for the cost of a full round and standard action, 7 times per day). The shaman in the group got a reserve feat for throwing fire around endlessly. Barbarian is pretty much the same, but more. Not sure what the cleric is getting this level, but he's our resident munchkin so it's probably good.

Basic plot of the campaign is undead hordes claiming the northern country. Party was recruited to help defend a town, which was overrun. Our valiant attempt got us an in with a heroic Brotherhood dedicated to defeating evil. They've sent us out on a recon mission, which ended with a hopeless last stand in an abandoned church against too many undead. We were saved at the last minute by some powerful magic or something, not super clear. Anyway, it brought us within a few days travel of the brotherhood's HQ, so current goal is to get there and report back. Had a brief side mission into a dungeon, which the DM improvised admirably.
Yeah, but it will have to wait until morning, I don't have them on my phone
I've got $85 PayPal I'd give. I'm in no way trying to lowball -- it's just my budget. I've been looking for some M50s since they're more portable, but these seem to be great headphones.

The German invasion of Belgium.  


First off, it was a neutral country. If you are the opposition, they are literally *giving*you propaganda that paints you as a monster, a nation that derives it's imperial power off of the soul of weaker nations. You are the nations that disregards self-determination, nation's wishes and are now engaged in an all out, complete mobilization war economy against other powers.  


In addition, the British were unsure whether they wanted to enter the war.  There is a great deal of debate on this topic whether they were or weren't.  There were rumors that they were going to tell the Germans that they wouldn't enter the war!  But everything goes out the window once Germany invades Belgium.  If I recall correctly, the British empire would intervene in a defensive war should Belgium be invaded by external forces.  


Lastly, the entire purpose of going through Belgium was that it was supposed to be quick.  They did not expect resistance, they expected the Belgians to cower and throw their weapons down.  As we know now, they resisted enough to stall the German forces. In addition, they also were able to demonstrate what the war would come to face. The defensive technology had outpaced the offensive technology so much so that even smaller nations like Belgium could cause sizable casualties, relative to size. 


Naturally, the Germans would still penetrate their defenses quickly and gain enough ground to invade France, but in the invasion, machine gun nests, artillery, kill holes, barbed wire, all these things would result in a meat grinder scenario.


Could the entire war have changed if they didn't invade Belgium? Possibly.  But we know what happened when did go through Belgium, and this would shape the history of the twentieth century.

A different less hostile world, as Romulus is supposed to be, compared to Vulcan, could result in a weaker race in only a few generations I would think. 

Another difference between Vulcans and Romulans is that Romulans have seemingly lost their telepathic abilities.
All the time!

I'm in stall 4, trying my hardest to push one out quickly before someone else comes in the bathroom. I hear the bathroom door open and I just freeze. I can be quietly holding a turd, suppressing my breathing, not making a noise at all. Then, this guy takes stall 3, not 1, not 2, the only stall right next to me. Stall door closes, pants down, I see his lower shins with his pants around his ankles and his nice office shoes. He sits down and just starts rippin' mad ass. I'm sitting there wide eyed, pants up past my knees and shirt covering my front so no one can peek through the door and see me exposed. I have my feet shifted slightly further right so he can't see 'em underneath the stall. I'm just dead silent waiting for his string of farts, plumps, audible wipes and eventual flush. A 10 minutes process for me is a 30 second process for him. Unbelievable.
It looks too busy. While the default Deep Striker design added a lot to the S-Gundam, it still managed to maintain the sleekness of it. A lot of these detail parts just seem to be there for there's sake.

I agree with almost everything you said and although I would say the vast majority of guardians shouldn't build any damage items, there are some cases where they synergies really well. An example I would say would be gem of iso on fafnir, which in my opinion is almost a core item on him to provide anyone with a slow after using his 2 on them. But for the vast majority of cases I would say damage items are a burden on a support.

Ticketing systems track what you do and how you do it. How quickly did you solve a ticket? How many times did you reassign it? How many tickets did you solve in a day, week or month? Is that a fluke or your average rates? Did ticket solutions get rejected and need to be reopened. 

These all start to a paint a data driven picture on how you contribute to the organization.

I have a friend who drives for transit. 

His preferred routes start and end near his home, and put him on-shift at the same time his wife works her job (which isn't a standard 9-5).

Other drivers prefer certain neighbourhoods, or to have layovers at certain places.


Some routes and schedules are "bottom of the barrel" choices. Would you want to be in the north end weekend evenings?

If you feel you are talented enought to acomplish something, taking your life is going to be a gamble, you have to wonder if you are in a position where you can polish your talents into an useful skill and furthermore, if you are or will be in a position where that skill will be put to actual use; it´s no secret that a lot of incredibly intelligent and skillful people end up with shitty jobs just because they weren´t given the proper circumstances to let their talent/skill shine but despite this fact, some manage to live a somewhat enjoyable life, most end up angry at the world and some take their life in frustation. 
Whatever you end up doing, I wish you luck, hopefully you´ll end up doing something good out of yourself and manage to get "a happy ending"

&gt; You can't honestly think we're past sexism.

Debatable and besides the point. Even if we are still sexist doesn't mean we should allow it to keep happening. Reverse sexism is still sexism. If we are so desperate to elect a woman just to superficially prove that we are somehow beyond the times of men being in charge we could also just elect a female squirrel as president and call it good. Keep the discussion civil and make it about competency not how Hillary's got a vagina. We know she's a woman, now move on.

I was less active when I was a kid.  Yet every year I go on vacation I gain slightly more weight than I did the year before despite also eating slightly fewer calories each year on vacation.  This time I gained 10 lbs over a period of 20 days.  I know for a fact I didn't eat 3500 calories every day on my trip.  I only exceeded 2500 calories on two days. 
 Half the days I just ate one turkey sandwich (240 calories) for lunch and two glasses of milk (300 calories) meaning whatever I ate for supper plus snacks had to be 3000 calories every single day for the numbers to add up.  Now the thing is I'm not really eating something I didn't eat when I was under 18 on the same trip yet I never gained any weight from the same trip back then.  And this didn't even start happening until 4 years ago despite taking this trip nearly every year of my 30+ year life.

&gt;We are entering a public opposition phase.

&gt;When a trademark examiner approves a trademark, like they did here, they put it forward for publication. On the date of publication, the public has 30 days to file an opposition. Had the Fine Bros kept quiet for another month, they almost certainly would have gotten this trademark, as no one seemed to notice it. Instead, they announced their ridiculous licensing program and turned all eyes on them. How they were not advised to remain silent a bit longer? No idea. But I can tell you that it was a huge mistake, and one that they will regret. Not only are they experiencing a terrible PR disaster right now, I am also assisting a large group of streamers and content creators in an opposition, pro bono (that means free), because I’m extra pissed about this one.

&gt;It’s as bad as it looks.

&gt;I’ve seen a lot of people arguing that this is just them protecting their brand, and that they would never go around bullying people. We’ve seen that’s blatantly false as they have issued a plethora of C&amp;D’s (if the reddit users claiming to have received ones are to be believed, which I think they are), and have even sent their fans to brigade programs like “Ellen” for doing a similar reaction bit. I watched Kids Say the Darndest Things. These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police.

&gt;This is a TRADEMARK not a COPYRIGHT.

&gt;Those words are not interchangeable, so stop it! Trademarks are much more broad and powerful protection than copyright. They protect your brand and/or logos and slogans. They also protect against things “confusingly similar,” so it’s possible you could be sued for naming your video “Kids have emotions.”

&gt;They already own two trademarks.

&gt;ELDERS REACT AND TEENS REACT are two trademarks they currently have registered. I will also be assisting my clients in cancelling both of those trademarks. It’s a bit more difficult than a straight opposition, but far from impossible. I believe we will win easily.

&gt;They have applied for a lot more than just REACT

&gt;On top of REACT, they have also applied for, and have been approved for CELEBRITIES REACT, ADULTS REACT, PARENTS REACT. We will be opposing those as well. They also are applying for DO THEY KNOW IT?, KIDS VS. FOOD, LYRIC BREAKDOWN, PEOPLE V. TECHNOLOGY, and TRY NOT TO SMILE OR LAUGH. While those are all ridiculously generic and descriptive, in my opinion (they hate coming up with original ideas, huh?), we will not be opposing those just yet. 

&gt;That wraps up where we stand now.  I know it gets complicated fast, and I’m always happy to answer questions if you have them. Feel free to email me at ryan@ryanmorrisonlaw.com or ping me on Twitter at @MrRyanMorrison. Also, spread the word, as the more people we have to oppose the better.

I haven't done anything with therapy as I haven't told anything to my parents and they just stopped taking me after the last one in December. But for the past week or so I've been doing better and I have no idea why.

As for being so young I actually am very thankful for being and isn't an insult in any way. I almost dread of growing up as it seems when you get older everything gets more boring and stressful. And I don't mean that in a bad way towards you (assuming your older than me). Honestly I just want to be a normal teenager and be able to hang out with people and form relationships and even party and little bit even if it mean getting in trouble cause I really just want to be happy and make my high school and college years awesome times of my life. The last year I was happy and remember everything to be near perfect was 8th grade year. Ever since then things have just died down and gotten boring as in no variety no new people I talk to and I just follow the same daily routine everyday.

I guess I could talk to my parents about therapy again but it just feels awkward. Plus I don't know all the different types other than CBT and what I need for me.

And regarding my lifestyle beside my social anxiety and low social skills I'm not healthy and have bad ance and I'm basically the definition of a awkward teenager. I'm not gonna lie, I really want to be something great and not be just be another person I want to at least be the guy that everyone is like"oh man I wish I could hang out with him more" and personal be very fit with a six pack and look good etc. But I know that's very ambitious and very unlikely.

Sorry I missed the + when you wrote 5+ and then mistakenly counted 2017 to get 5 returns!

Are you planning to file out of order because you want to netfile 2013 to 2016 and have to paper file the earlier returns?

If you at least prepare them in order it may be easier to keep track of the RRSP contributions and any carry forwards, but in the end what matters most is CRA getting all of the information.  

How far back do you need to go?  SimpleTax will do from 2012 - 2016.  If you need to go back further then maybe the best software choice is GenuTax.  It is a free download that covers back to 2003.  

See http://www.genutax.ca/

My point of view is that the thing doesn't really exist and it's something people make up to feel better or worse about themselves. Some people are better at certain things than others, and that's about it. Some people speak more confidently in conversations but it's questionable whether or not they should.

Edit: It's like the whole discussion around people being 'alpha'. There isn't really much truth to it, and I'm pretty sure the theory doesn't even apply to wolves, rendering it pretty moot.

I don't think MO'M will not qualify in many places. Everywhere, making him viable will be either beneficial to HRC or beneficial to Bernie. Both camps will be trying to make him viable one way or the other. Likewise, they're likely to say, "we only need 3-6 more people to be viable!" And in those situations, it's fairly easy to convince a few to join you to at least make your candidate viable. Undecideds alone usually do this. I actually anticipate a LOT of undecideds break O'Malley because they don't have a strong horse in the race and it's human nature to help someone out.

You should read the criminal code section on [assault](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-265.html). The body part (more or less) doesn't matter. The amount of force doesn't matter. In fact, one could argue the "boxer's stance" was assault unto itself.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music.

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

You probably have some manner of holding tank rinsing system on the RV that's in need of repair. This is the only way that potable water should be interacting with the holding tanks. You'll have to go over the plumbing and see if you can figure out where the water enters the tanks, and figure out what is going wrong.
From the results they show, this was definitely done on untrained people. 

Guys, extreme weight loss protocols established in the 70's which provided ample amounts of protein show that people who don't even train, but have enough body fat to sustain ridiculous deficits don't lose lean mass. And we're not talking about young people full of anabolic hormones either.

In this case you have the age, hormone levels, clearly excess amount of body fat and shock induced by resistance training that will preserve or even build muscle during initial weight loss.

I knew the first troll. This deranged kid everyone knew climbed a tree in a fake protest to "save the trees". There was a landscaping crew who had tied ropes to the tree to stabilize it. The principle came outside and ordered this kid down. He jumped down while laughing, grabbed one of the ropes, and pulled the tree down himself. The entire school was watching this at lunch inside the cafeteria, he was like a god.
I thought he said crips but it appears im mistaken
Good question. I accept any opinion that is not racist, sexist or offensive/close minded in any other way. So I guess I'd have to say no to those.

Once the parties have chosen their nominees then we start the actual race for the presidency.  In November we have the general election where we vote...  But that still doesn't actually vote for the candidates. What each state does is allocate electors who vote as members of the electoral college. These are the actual people who vote for the President. Each state has a number of electors equal to their congressional representation. Almost all states will direct their electors to all vote for whoever wins the popular election in the state. My state (Maine) has 4 electors and 2 are determined by the whole states votes and the other 2 are individually determined by our house districts. To add another roadbump to this insane process, electors can decide to vote for whoever they want anyway.
Yes, the websites say that if the taxes cannot be collected from the donor, then the receiver might have to pay.  This could be the case if the treasure were found after FF has died and the estate had already been settled, unless he left a provision in his will (which is quite possible).  If FF is alive, however, and if he hasn't already given away the rest of his money, he's probably below the limit and he wouldn't have to pay anything at the time.  He would however have to indicate this in his income taxes and give his cost basis (how much he paid to acquire the items in the treasure).  His estate would eventually end up paying the tax if it was worth offer $5.3M.

The poem clearly says that the treasure is a gift: "I give you title to the gold".  If would be hard for FF or his estate to later argue that it was not a gift.  I don't see anywhere FF said you'd have to pay taxes on it.

Even if for some reason the finder does have to pay taxes (only scenario is if FF is dead and hasn't provisioned for this in his will and his estate has given more than $5.3M over his lifetime), it would still be prudent for the finder to auction the chest as a whole and pay the taxes.  It is a 35% tax rate, and surely the hit you would take for selling the treasure in pieces rather than as a whole and also under the table would be a lot more than 35%.  If you melt down the gold, you lose the value of the nuggets (worth 4x their weight) and the numismatic value of the coins.
Coming home from classes at AUC, the first plane had just hit, thought it was a movie, then when I found out it wasn't, I thought it was an accident.

I feel Nel, Szayelaporro, Chad (HM), Orihime (HM), Visored Ichigo, and Renji (HM) are all good for an update. I know we have the FB Renji but we don't have a good Soul Society/Hueco Mundo Renji....we have Frenji and he sucks. 
They could probably do Hallibel, Starkk, Gin, Tousen (Hollow), Yoruichi (Armor) and Ishin too as they haven't aged too well either. I would count a 5 star Yumichika as a remake too as he does have a 4 star non Tag Team version. 

Throw in some new characters to the above remakes like Aaroniero, Zommari and the Tres Bestias and you could squeeze out at least 6 gachas


And just to throw it out, character least in need of a rework....Byakuya. He already has 8 6 star versions.

They're all very lightly used. The perfumes were swiped maybe 5 times each, and Brightside lotion I mostly used from the lid though I did shake it up a couple times because it's very runny and I wanted to make sure it was properly mixed.

Perfumes would be US$15 for one, US$25 for both. The lotion I would like $18 for.

Given your height and weight, it is very unlikely you have "man boobs".

We get this question pretty often. When the person asking has stats like yours, and they post a photo, invariably their chest looks completely normal. The issue is almost certainly in your head.
I would not call it that, but it is certainly cute and sexy.
I'd have the framers put blocking under the holes in the floor, just to close them off and allow for some support around the breakage.  the hole in the joist is also pretty minor, the HVAC guy Will have bigger holes than that, and those joists are so close together that I can't see having any issues.

My best friend of 15 years secretly broke up me and my wife while when we were having normal arguements and issues. I was on a business trip and he talked her into divorcing me. He told my friend that it was just normal problems that really wouldve resolved on their own , but he wanted to break us up, not to date my ex-wife, but he just wanted to sleep with her and get nothing else from her. (My "friend" told me later when the betrayal friend and my current friend ended their friendship). So its like double betrayle because my friend didnt tell me it happened.

My BP has been running high (in the 130s/80s), and at my appointment on Friday it was 130s/90s, repeatedly. My first thought was "No, I have work on Sunday. I'm not ready to get off work." and then "no I'm not ready to be done being pregnant" and then "oh shit, I'm so scared of labor."

They sent me to the hospital for monitoring, and there my BP stayed in the 120s-130s/80s range. Monitor was also picking up contractions every 10 minutes, so they did a cervical check. Since I was still closed, they cleared me and sent me home.

And my BP is still in the 120s/80s range.

Hoping your BP stabilizes and stays in the non-concern range!

The CX-3 is actually on the Mazda 2 platform; literally a Toyota Yaris (as it sold here in Canada) with AWD. 

Mazda does dial up the driving fun factor on every car they make but the cargo capacity is really small as its more of a sub-compact. For the same money I'd pick a Subaru Impreza hatch. Same engine size, more cargo volume, and about the same driving experience without faux-SUV the plastic cladding.

My mom and I are emotionally very similar in terms of how we process and experience emotions. We both feel things deeply, wear our hearts our our sleeve and have obvious and visceral emotional reactions. I cry in response to pretty much any high emotion just like my mom. My sister though is nothing like either of us and is exactly like my dad. 

Emotionally I'm like my mom but I have ADHD like my dad and my mom is more on the anal and compulsive end of the spectrum so that aspect I did not get.

&gt; Attack the problem at hand the only way it can be attacked: Don't login the overpopping faction!

And as a main TR outfit, i can tell you i perfectly understand why people maining TR log onto their TR.

I see no point in logging in my NC char which is BR8, or my VS alt when i have my whole TR outfit online.

If some people play 3 factions on Miller, then maybe they would be more incline to play an underpop faction. But as a main TR, i (and many other) won't just leave my faction and start from 0 on the other side. I have my friends and my whole outfit on TR. Maybe you're okay with switching side every now and then, but some people here invested thousands of hours into their char (TR, NC or VS), and simply don't want to play another faction.

TR having such a pop is sad, unhealthy for the server, but you need to understand us at some point ...

&gt; Now get your arguments straight and stop attacking me as a person. 

And btw, are you a little bit paranoïd or something ? If you read what he said, nowhere was he attacking you as a person. And i see a lot of good arguments in both sides.

I hear the weapons argument a lot, and I see where it comes from - it is pretty clear that there are more NFL guys at USC than there are at Wyoming.

That being said, while I think surrounding talent should be a consideration, it can't (to me) tell much more than a small portion of the story. I say this mainly because I think the argument goes both ways: yes, Allen has fewer NFL weapons to help him move the ball, but he also has fewer NFL defenders trying to stop him. To what extent can we say that the lack of NFL-caliber players he works against week in and week out balances the lack of NFL guys he has on his side? I rarely see this analyzed whenever the weapons argument is brought out to justify a prospect, but I think it's very important. 

Also with regard to the weapons argument and keeping the above in mind, can we really say that the difference in quality of weapons explains the statistical gap? Because the statistical gap here is pretty massive, and while Wyoming isn't USC I would think that there's at least something close to enough talent there on that offense (2 2017 draft picks and 2 more priority UDFA's - that's not nothing) to help a QB put up a performance closer to what we'd see from a weapon-laden USC QB in Darnold than what we actually saw from Allen, *especially* when we take into account the inferior competition said offense would be facing (USC, as noted earlier, has a much tougher schedule).

I just don't see the weapons being a valid excuse for the shortcomings we saw from Allen. I think it's less about his team and more about the flaws you mentioned: poor footwork, poor decisionmaking, not terribly strong eye discipline and inconsistent accuracy/touch. 
To be completely honest with you, I really don't think he's a much more developed passer than a guy like Lamar Jackson - that he isn't getting any of the position-switch talk Jackson is going to have to face is a little surprising.

All that being said, I mostly agree with you: I see what there is to like about Allen. He does have tools. He'll run at least a 4.7, he's huge, he's got a great arm, and he just looks the part of a prototypical QB. I just don't see QB1, that's all.

If you came to me and said Rosen was the clear QB1, I could see the sense in that. I am not personally excited about him as a prospect (I really like athleticism in my QBs, and Rosen is a classic, relatively slow pocket-passer - my least favorite kind of passer, though I'll give him some credit for his footwork), but from what I've seen he makes at least some sense as a QB1, more than Allen does at this point in time. 

Rosen, as you say, seems closer to NFL-development than most prospect, so in my view Rosen = QB1 makes some sense. Allen? Not so much. He just seems way too far away.

But that's just me.

Actually, /u/Reddit_Conspiracist it looks from the picture if you're super careful (look up the manual and try to find assembly instructions for that specific model) you may be able to take it apart and replace just that individual fan blade.
Yah, this is how I know I have to do it. It's just a curiosity of the system that by actually trying to do something, you can fail at something that, otherwise, you essentially automatically succeed at unless the DM decides that you don't.

In most other circumstances within the system, this mutually exclusive situation isn't present. Consider that with other opposed rolls, the DM isn't required to arbitrarily determine an outcome outside of the presence of the binary pass/fail condition.

In other circumstances there is the active participation of the players in the situation. This is the reverse, where *inaction* is, in essence, possibly better than action.

Yo illmac huge SP fan here, been listening for years. When will you guys make another group album? Also ethic and simple and them only appear on group tracks. What have they been doing/ why did dbsr split up? Huge only one fan also major shout out for your albums like chron legacy and all that. I am only 20 but I listening since I was a freshman in Highschool and grew up on the highway leading to st John's and shit. I never got to see you live, will you do more Portland shows? I know Portland sucks now and the bay is where it's at ofc, but I missed out on this era and just 're live it through your music.

I'm in the same boat, man. I'll carry through conversations but can never really escalate, as I'm not sure how or when. Even when a girl seems interested, you never truly know.

I have met a girl who for all intents and purposes *seemed* interested, at least according to my friends. But some people are really touchy/feel-y and give off the wrong impressions, so I'm never sure what to do. I figured the fact that she was touching my leg and baked me brownies as evidence she liked me, but I was incorrect.

You can never really be sure.

I guess the real solution to this is in numbers. If someone likes you enough, you can probably make a few mistakes or have a few flaws that they'll overlook, but you need to meet a lot of people to find someone who actually likes you for you, and not just in a friend way.
Hey! Got any cool videos of this raid featuring teams not listed above? If so, post them as a reply to this comment!

&gt; I support the 'genius' Vitalik Butterin doesn't ever make typing mistakes and so he thought that putting error checking into addresses was not worth the effort.

So what seems to have happened is that they did the protocol level first, and got that out the door as soon as it was ready, and said, "things like check-sums for addresses can be handled by the tooling, so we'll worry about that stuff later". 

Architecturally this sort-of makes sense, but the problem was that people wanted to send each other mETH right away, so using the addresses as they were immediately turned into a de-facto standard. There's a slightly hacky checksum method involving making things upper and lower case, but not everybody is using it, and if your tooling can't insist on it then it's a lot less useful than it could be.

This is then aggravated by the fact that the de-facto standard tooling has ended up being JavaScript, which is notorious for merrily converting things of one type to some other type in some weird way without wanting to bother your pretty little head about it. The python libraries are quite a lot less awful in this respect, but they're currently quite move-fast-and-break-things-ish which isn't really what you want in this context.
I think they'd have a hard time keeping Sasha/Bayley interesting, with the belt involved, until Summerslam.

&gt; Collapse, sure? Direct assault on democracy? That's a little bit of hyperbole.

- Venezuela is changing its system of government based on a fraction of a minority of its population in a vote that saw polling stations closed early - or never opened at all - in areas where opposition parties dominate, even though they all boycotted the vote. 
- Venezuela already *had* a referendum on changing the constitution [mere weeks ago] (http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/americas/venezuela-referendum-votes/index.html) and it was resoundingly rejected, so now Maduro tries to force his hand another way. 
- Dozens are dead. Maybe hundreds. 
- Venezuela's Attorney General calls it ["the end of freedom of expression."] (http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/31/americas/venezuela-constituent-assembly-election/index.html)
- Maduro's stated intent is to bring 'all branches of the government' under party control. There will be not a hint of independence in the judiciary.
- **100% of the new body that will rewrite the constitution will be nominated by Maduro's party.**

Venezuela is on the march to autocracy.

TBH I think the power level for the fighters is actually pretty good. That said, I like some of your fighter-variant ideas, but I wouldn't put them behind engineering unlocks. You're right that engineering is way more powerful than fighters, but that's because engineers is OP. :)

I like the idea of a repair-beam fighter, especially if you can get the AI to focus on repairing the mothership instead of actively attacking.

I also like the idea of a variant that sacrifices the defensive module for the ability to do offensive ECM. 

I don't like the siphon fighter (too complicated) or the anti-fighter fighter (not necessary, laser fighters are already very strong against other fighters).
I wish I could show you my reaction...

&gt; Climate change may have contributed to the suicides of nearly 60,000 Indian farmers and farm workers over the past three decades, according to new research that examines the toll rising temperatures are already taking on vulnerable societies.

&gt; Illustrating the extreme sensitivity of the Indian agricultural industry to spikes in temperature, the study from the University of California, Berkeley, found an increase of just 1C on an average day during the growing season was associated with 67 more suicides.

&gt; Last year the Indian government launched a &amp;pound;1bn insurance scheme to protect against crop failures and try to halve farmer and farm worker suicides.

big dick here. I can assure you its not the best thing in the world, definitely a love hate relationship. Every time i meet a new girl and she sees me naked for the first time, or puts her hand in my pants, or sees the bulge, her eyes light up and she gets unbelievably excited and licks her lips and comments on how great it is. Then when its time for actual sex, things take a complete nosedive. Its all "ow that hurts" "you're going too deep" "my mouth hurts too much to give blowjobs" "we can't do *that* position" etc. etc. Then she goes and tells all her friends about the guy with the big dick and the cycle starts all over again with one of them.

Pinch your nipple, and just underneath the nipple. If it feels like a jelly shot, you have gyno. If it just feels like fat, you just have excess fat.

Ignore people requesting you eat less.  At 5'10 70kg is a perfect weight. You could probably increase in weight. 

You need to lift more frequently, and consistently.

Also work on your back, as slumping over will make your chest look worse.

I absolutely have no confidence in these dipshits to handle some new moderate crisis, let alone something like a pandemic or financial collapse, but their complete non-response to the awful [ongoing famines](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/1/15653970/south-sudan-hunger-crisis-famine) might already be causing tens of thousands of people to die. 

Clinton wouldn't have done shit about Yemen, and probably would have restarted selling cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia just like Trump, but absolutely would have participated in the planned [G7](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/25/trump-advisor-stephen-miller-blocked-g7-migration-proposal/) summit on the famines in Africa that Stephen Miller blocked and would have kept overall foreign aid about the same.

DEN-TAL-PLAN!
I've always found this tension between empathy for real people and the particularly human sense of humour where sometimes a murder is hilarious. I can't square the difference between the two, but I'm fairly certain the latter is an important part of our make-up too, *in the right place*. Any thoughts on that contrast? 

For an example, the murder of Charles Lennox Richardson whose last words as quoted were apparently, "I know how to deal with these Japanese" right before trying to ride through the heavily armed procession of the vice-regent of Satsuma. Richardson's fate was much mourned in the Victorian newspapers, but most people today have to fight down an urge to laugh at this case of a colonial mentality getting the guy an immediate smackdown. (At this point, I must confess I made [this meme image of the incident](http://68.media.tumblr.com/ce1b67521a58c079356f74c049c2da27/tumblr_nk4z1cXprY1tbbhh6o1_500.jpg).)

And yet, Richardson was, despite his arrogant attitude and ignorance about Japan, unjustly murdered. The Japanese government had signed a treaty promising that English citizens would be safe. Earlier that day, other daimyo processions had let him and his companions ride through because they actually respected the shogunate's law. Richardson had the ill fortune to run into the Satsuma procession, people who thought themselves somewhat independant of the shogunate, despite officially being in fealty to the shogun. Look at it from this angle, and Richardson has more similarities to modern American citizens who run into unjust trouble abroad. People rightly get angry when such people are mocked for their naivete and superior attitudes, because that doesn't justify their being murdered. 

And yet, even after going deep into Richardson's death, pondering the effect on his companions and family, there still is something darkly humourous about it. Colonialism usually doesn't get its come-uppance so *perfectly* and dramatically. It's an upset of the usual order of things. Richardson's privileged position and fame in death can be contrasted to the many quiet deaths in the same period. For example, no one seriously bothered calculating or estimating peasant deaths from upheaval in the Bakumatsu period and Meiji Restoration, although they did estimate samurai deaths. Perhaps, the limit for dark humour is that its targets aren't the voiceless and the oppressed?

Very. I was a kid in high school and had a girl I vaguely knew over while my parents were out of town. I was nervous so I got a little high and drunk beforehand. Couldn't get it up and she thought that was funny so started gooogling "whiskey dick" and laughing while describing symptoms and causes. I proceeded to go on a walk to try to clear my head. 

Left the girl in bed and while walking through my house I realized my phone was missing. Paranoia set in and I began to believe there was an intruder and made her get up and walk the whole house with me with a knife. 

Finally realize I had left it under the bed and we went back to sleep. She pity fucked me in the morning and it was just super sad.
technology does increase productivity. the worker will always be paid the minimum for subsistence because there are a surplus of workers (almost always) and companies want to maximize profit. 

lets say what a worker produces in a day = X X 
lets also say that they work in a field that produces everything that is needed to support the worker and that this is represented by one X. the company pays the worker X (the amount they need to survive each day) and gets a surplus of one X/worker. 

now say a technological advance makes it so that each worker is twice as efficient, producing four X

X X X X

where before it was just 2

X X

they are still paid one X because they still need the same things to subsist but the surplus is now 3 X for the company. this is how increased productivity results in a greater profit for the industry. if it were a moral system, increased productivity would mean that workers would be able to work less hours or be compensated more for the increased output. but that is not capitalism.

Hi.
I never do but am considering doing something to help. I recently read a study that the blue light from technology such as computers and phones cause your body to produce much less melatonin than normal. So I'm looking into having one of my two sets of glasses fitted with blue light filtering lenses which is actually a thing. This way i can continue to do the things I do and hopefully get really sleepy at a decent time. I need to be on my computer at night because I am taking online classes and got a full time job.
It gave me a headache
Definitely, but I think there's enough people interested for a new service to be provided.
Aight dude. You must be blind.
Because of several factors, first there is the history and context, most first contacts happened a long time ago, when countries were not defined by national boundaries, then you have the language itself, you cannot expect pronunciation and transmission not to be deformed. Trust me, there is no way a native english speaker can properly pronounce names like I'rak (Iraq), Bɑːˈreɪn (Bahrain) or even Bɐʁˈd̪ɑːd̪ (Baghdad).

And it actually applies to everyday words two, algebra comes from the name Al Jabre, algorithm comes from another guy's name, Alkhawarizmi. It also works from english to other languages, the Japanese can't have a word finish with a consonant so rocket became roketto, trunk became toranku and bread is panno :) because this one come from the french pain (pronounced pan with a silent n).
Maybe they should be judged based on their interpretation (as evil), and the others judged according to theirs (as not evil)

I remember how fun it was to completely design your layout and color scheme for your Myspace page.

I love how I can absolutely gorge myself on sushi and not feel like shit after.  Like, if I eat too much burger or pizza or steak and potatoes, I feel bloated and tired for the rest of the day, but I can pack sushi in almost to the point of stomach pain and feel great an hour later.

I'd eat it probably daily or at least five times a week if I could afford it.

As dumb as it seems online the American public is pretty astute. As a single person I can attest we aren't sending our best, but go talk to some families if you have the chance. Families do A LOT of thinking and problem solving. They're thinking about mortgage, retirement, saving for disaster, health, helping the kids, schools, 8000 things they have to do on Saturday, etc. 

I don't think you'll find a family in America who believes this stupidity. What you will find is a bunch of single cunts who's livelihood or social status depends on racism. They'll be all over this.
I genuinely want to know the answer to this
Oh, man, that sounds perfect! I'll have to keep an eye out on the swaps.

When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong.
&gt; you're not a very "guessy" type it seems

Maybe I'm just being thick (I'm not the best at math) but why would the mathematician think differently, it is calculus right? Or is this a Newton joke?
The real answer!
The "reformers" were too clever for such an oversight.  Had they left the liturgical calendar and the cycle of readings untouched (and let them continue to develop organically as they had for 1969 years), tradition could have far more easily reasserted itself.  No - they wanted to make sure their innovations were here to stay.  But they didn't account for the fact that one cannot simply stomp out nearly two millennia of tradition, and nowadays, even though the "OF" and "EF" each has its own calendar (but remember - they are both just different expressions of the 'one same Roman Rite'!) there are priests who take the time to write two homilies if necessary for both forms of the Mass, or even pray the Office and live the liturgical calendar of 1962, while offering the *Novus Ordo* each day according to its calendar.  Crazy times in the Holy Roman Church.
I can't believe how many RotMG players can be so naïve. Not all lag that someone complains about is client-side. A lot of the lag people are experiencing right now is server-side and it's clearly evident. Go to the fame train and you will see 10 people yelling "LAG" every time there's a rubber band spike. 

I, for example, use the recommended version of Adobe Flash Player Projector to play RotMG. I get no client-side lag whatsoever. I've been receiving the usual amount of server-side lag in the past few months, but I have been getting more lag since the latest build (The Nest update). 

You should really pay attention in-game before you start telling people that every bit of lag they experience is client-side.

The first time the vehicle attempted to get through, it was going slow enough not to injure anyone. Anybody can see that. The time that the vehicle actually ran through the crowd, a bunch of people were slamming and (at least it looked like) intending to damage the vehicle or injure the person inside. 

If you were in the situation where people were banging on your vehicle, I bet that you would attempt to get away by any means necessary, which is what the person in the vehicle did. 

Also, what kind of deranged person knowingly steps in front of several vehicles that are going 60+ MPH? Seriously? It's literally a death wish.

How about the one where Beth cocked a shotgun and Jerry said "I wish that shotgun was my penis," to which Beth replied "if it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway." This is a reference to the fact that Ernest Hemingway killed himself by putting a shotgun in his mouth and is damn clever.

Rest assured the builder still made a nice profit off of you. In my area some of the builders bought land 20, even 40 years ago and have been sitting on parts of it until it's profitable to build on. Not everything they bought turns out to be in a place where people eventually want to live. But real estate is cyclical, every 20 years or so there is a big downturn and if you have cash at that point you can scoop up some good deals.
Ultimately there's a few different things that are likely going on.

Nightfalls were usually locked out if you didn’t have the current DLC. You were able to do some of the old heroic strikes, but no longer, now that there's a playlist. You can't get close to the right light level for it, and even if the lvl 36 playlist were already open, a level 34 might have a hard time with it. There aren't any other intermediate strike playlists now, like the old 22, 24, 26 &amp; 28 playlists. It's 20, and that's it.

The daily missions and Crucible matches are out of reach too.

Nothing can be bought from vendors either, due to the level requirement. It might not even be possible to earn the new legendary mark currency either, can't remember. You used to be able to squeak by and still get vendor gear before, without buying any expansions, even if you didn't 'need' the new gear because you didn’t have higher level content to play in the first place. No longer. More than usual was taken out for those who didn’t buy the DLC, but things were still made irrelevant for those who did buy too. Funny how that works.

I used to be a police officer and now I'm a programmer.

It was absolutely worth the switch.  I make way more money and am significantly less stressed in this career field.  I also found myself able to relate better to my coworkers in this field as opposed to my fellow officers.  

As for how I did it, it's what I went to school for in college.  Interestingly enough in school I thought I would HATE being a programmer and couldn't wait to graduate so I could pursue my dream of becoming a police officer.  Turns out I hated being a cop and being a programmer wasn't so bad.  My parents were footing a good portion of my tuition and they wouldn't let me major in Criminal Justice (thank god) so I was like "eh I guess I like computers" and majored in Information Systems instead.

I would say it's a good career path.  I make good enough money to live quite comfortably in Southern California.  I started my career on the east coast so your mileage may vary.  I'd say it's also worth noting there are different...industries? you can get into programming for.  Personally, I've done my whole career with Department of Defense contractors (Think Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and the like) and I love it.  None of these crazy mandatory 60-70 hour work weeks or anything like that.  In fact going over 80 hours in a two week pay period is a big no-no without prior authorization, which is usually not given.  I've also found that most of these companies follow the 9/80 work schedule.  So we do 9 hour workdays instead of 8 and we get every other friday off (the other friday is the day we usually work 8 hours).  Another argument I'd make for work-life balance in this field is that all of my employers  have been very flexible as far as workday start/end times.  They usually don't when you start/leave as long as you're able to attend all meetings and get your 80 hours per pay period in.  So if you're an early bird or like to sleep in a little they'll usually accommodate you.

The only real con I'd say I've seen is that they tend to drag their feet as much as possible when it comes to promotions/big raises.  Consequently, that usually means if you want the raise/promotion you have to do a bit of employer hopping.  

As far as tips go, get as much demonstrable experience as you can.  Do you have a degree?  And I mean ANY degree.  One of our junior programmers has a biology degree and didn't want to do biology stuff so he did what you did and started taking a bunch of online courses and racked up a bit of experience that way.  In my world many of the contracts given by the government require a degree, but it doesn't specify what kind.  Some of the brightest programmers I've ever met don't have degrees and run into issues getting jobs with defense contractors.  It's stupid I know, but that's how the game is played.  I would also suggest trying to meet people already in the industry.  Networking with people is a great way to find new jobs and get in front of the applicant line when new jobs pop up.

Like you said, It's the internet. Even if we were to have some sort of filter, what's it gonna do? Sure it will be effective at first but people will only keep finding ways to move around it. (Example. "Nigger and nigga are banned but people will use nibba or something.) Also, you can't ban too many words because then the chat will be nearly useless. 

In my eyes, grow up. Simply ignoring it will help you. I've been told to "go back to your country, wetback" or "end yourself you fucking leech." They are looking for attention and trying to get a reaction out of you. My squad and I used to play with a super toxic "friend". This guy always told the enemy team to hang themselves and whatnot. And guess that? He was very miserable and unhappy himself. So don't take what they say to heart. There are some genuinely good hearted players out there.  Do what I do. During games I turn off PC chat if the enemy gets too toxic, and I always play with at least a 3 man squad.

To clarify the mis-advice by the above poster, you need to make sure you have a 9v battery in the Rode mic. Do not turn on phantom in the recorder.

If you're using a 1/8" to XLR adapter between the mic and the recorder, this will not work properly, as the recorder will record the difference in the signal between the right and left channels.

Use a 1/8" extension cable to get the mic plugged into the Ext_input of the recorder, and it should start working. There is no benefit from using a XLR cable here, as the signal coming from the mic is unbalanced.

Edit: the other poster corrected me, the mic is mono. If you use it with a 1/8" to XLR adapter your recorder will not hear anything, since the signals will cancel out.

It goes without saying that these larger creatures will be harder to kill. I think it's be cool to try and take one down, but death is quite a consequence, especially as you get further into the galaxy. Discovering them would probably yield quite a few Units alone.
&gt;Like I don't hate the content i'm learning but I don't love it either, it's more I wan't to to learn it to get a job, i'm not super interested in it.

The one thing I can say for sure is that there's a very high rate of burnout among IT workers. The hours suck, in most companies the 
IT management and budgeting sucks, it's very competitive, there's high risk of making really bad mistakes because you work with the most critical systems, and when something goes wrong IT is frequently the first to get the finger pointed at and the last to get recognized for saving the day.

Don't get me wrong, there's some good jobs and companies out there that do IT right. But in a lot of places, the only thing that will get you through the job is liking it enough to keep doing it.

I don't want to discourage you, but after your 10th year of 3 AM on-call emergencies, even people who love the subject matter will start to question if they want to stay in the field.
*Thats the joke*

Take one, please! I got so excited I made so much stickiness!
Holy shit how many times can this get reposted?
it's not a High School book to me and I would have hated the book in HS.  Both because of themes and language and dense plot and general opacity.  

Give it another try when you're in the mood for something complex and difficult.  Something that's kind of an adventure of it's own.

I often experience a period of frustration in the first third of a Gene Wolfe book... like pushing a boulder up a hill...  Then we hit the crest of the hill and I can't stop turning pages fast enough as the story careens down the other side.

A lot of times, I just kinda skim over stuff that doesn't make sense and leave it for a second read thru when it's easier to enjoy.

On the other hand, Wolfe might not be your thing.
It was shuttered.
I found that horse and cucumber are a bit easier than the examples given in the text book.
ah kaya... ako I watch my words pag kasama si baby
huh if ever i do speed up sometimes it's because I think the person is socially awkward and that after they had a long internal debate about holding the door open or not ("am i too far? will it be weird? / Am I too close? Will it be rude?'') decided to do it anyways then starting panicking when they realized i was too far and i wanna spare them the anxiety.
*I scan the area, trying to see what's there that would be edible on an immediate timescale.*
*Good Omens* by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman
I read your question as a false dichotomy. It's not a choice of physical beauty vs. ambition. These are two of many qualities in a human being, and not necessarily the ones that are most important.

My personal answer (and this is just me), is I'm most attracted to women who are 1) intelligent, 2) down-to-earth, and 3) passionate. So, someone who is at least my intellectual equal, isn't arrogant or conceited or inclined to flaunt their credentials as overly important status symbols, and retains their unique, quirky personality and love for being alive and expressing their own unique creative energies.. is pretty much the textbook pattern of who I fall for.

Note that "physical beauty" doesn't come up once in the above description. Obviously it matters, as it does to anyone, but practically speaking that just naturally falls out of all the above. In fact, someone who's intelligent, down-to-earth, and passionate would probably look more physically beautiful to me than the exact same person with a less compelling personality. And someone who has physical beauty and nothing else is frankly not at all interesting to me.

"Ambition", too, does not appear in that list. Frankly, the word "ambition" is a turnoff to me. Autonomy, self-reliance, resolve, inner strength - those are all highly attractive words. But "ambition" reminds me too much of people who are overly career focused to the point of losing their basic heart and humanity, having little interest outside of their jobs, adopting an alpha-person "I will take over the world" attitude, and more often than not just not being very nice or empathetic people. I should offer the caveat here that I live in New York - the land of unhealthily ambitious people, so that probably skews my perception of the term. I've encountered too many people who want to climb to the top and crush anyone who gets in their way, and that kind of ambition is just being a nasty and self-centered human being. I want nothing to do with that, nor to have that as any kind of influence in my life. 

Speaking more directly to your own words, an "average-looking" lawyer/doctor/professor could be highly attractive to me depending on her other personality characteristics. But if she chose her career over her partner / family and ended up "living to work", I'd be deeply unhappy in such a relationship and would probably not ultimately be able to sustain it.

Please by all means find success and independence so you never have to rely on anyone else for your well-being. But don't forget to laugh, skip, play hooky from work sometimes, and be silly and goofy and loving before you wake up one day and realize you spent the best parts of your life at a desk building up credentials that you can't carry with you to the grave and maybe not having had the raw experiences of love and bonding and basic human companionship that ultimately (in my view) give life its greatest value.

Hard to agree, having shooters at the x games makes as much sense as a dunk contest at EVO
I personally think its fine but I think x-games should just have a separate esports section, so its clear they're two distinct divisions. An extreme sports medal is obviously different from an esports one, and we all know it requires more physical activity. I think its great the x-games are pushing forward esports, so I definitely don't want them to drop it in sake of preserving only "action sports" with the x-games brand. Just have a seperate section, make it clear its seperate, and then I think we're good. 

Just my 20 cents!!!

They have for the most part. A couple of high profile but extremely rare accidents bring death counts up, just like planes, but for the most part, there's very little risk.
Ok cool thanks guy. It actually says 25ml for mine, you must have gotten a bigger one. I hope to find out the clam is more potent in the PG than the pellets
That's very good of you, Irvette. Helping the world is always a great goal to have.

What is this from?
Marx never advocated breaking up monopolies or returning full value of commodities to workers in *Capital* (in fact, in a way, monopolies were a good thing to Marx because it represented the further centralization of capital, and would be easier for workers to take over, than if capital is broken up.) *Capital* was a description of how the capitalist system worked, based on the theories of Smith and Ricardo. Marx did see that there were contradiction within the system that would cause workers to rise up and reclaim the full value of their work (so going on into communism), but these ideas are more outlined in the *Critique of the Gotha Program* and *The German Ideology*.

Yeah I loved that as well. Muh entirely black tanks

well you choose not to see how women are hurt by similar things and got all woe is me. So ignore those people, find a new workplace with men who will respect you or something.
Can you give an example?

Eh people do what they want. When I worked at the grocery store I sold a lot of smokes to people struggling to breathe using oxygen tanks. Not my problem or my place to tell them they shouldn't do it.
I don't see it... :(
Agree. I don't want things to cheapen Epsilon's sacrifice, but I really like the Church character. Wash kinda fills his slot in the roster, but not completely. I won't be sad if Church comes back.
I believe in God because I choose to believe in God. Between the choice of believing in God and not believing in God, I have found that believing in God provides my life with meaning, purpose, and happiness, while not believing in God only provides emptiness. I am a Catholic/Jesuit, but I don't necessarily agree with everything the modern church has to say about topics. I make my own decisions about my faith and beliefs.
That's so cute! :)

Yeah they talked about it. i dont think its evidence but they atleast acknowledged Smite. and even went out to editing Smite Footage in.
My friends and I have the exact same feelings. I was also born in '87 and feel super lucky to have the knowledge of past and present.
Oh awesome, a new website to have a look at after work. Yeah I'm very new I kind of just listen vaguely when the casters are calling that someone is at "Banana" and hope that the name of the player currently playing is that player they called out. That's how I've been slowly learning the locations. Plus map awareness will come with time like it did with CoD for me (I'm hoping) I can watch a CoD match and know whats what and where but with CS I am very lost at the moment. Again thanks.
Someone needs to get their nails done
I don't agree. I've been a fan since I was born and will continue to be one until I'm dead. But I am disappointed with the management and ownership in the last 5 years.  I didn't like how the Illitch family used tax loopholes to fund the stadium in a time of terrible financial straights for Detroit. I don't like how they continue to mislead the public about the competitiveness of the team and put off a rebuild. 

There has to be some accountability for management and ownership and hitting them where it hurts is a good start.
*waves from the bar in her wheelchair*
Not sure if you got through all of the post, but I didn't take anything. A friend of mine did, but I was clean. If they pull the cameras they'll just see me pick up some items, walk around with them, and then put them down. Is "accessory to shoplifting" a crime?
I actually can't stop laughing at the idea of this match
JERICHO WON!?!?!?

HELL YEAH BAYBAY!!!
Enjoy
do you know if i bought the wrong spacers so is it just a matter of socket type.
Duuuude! Those are the ones!! Thanks!!
Which I agree with, and why there has been the doctor's involvement when that is the case. I totally disagree with restrictions on late term abortions that are almost always for medical reasons.

But this article has nothing to do with that.

That's why I don't like spending money on other gacha games. At least in this game, boobs can be bought.
Unless you are diabetic, then avoid keto diets because it can kill you.  

Also, Suger is addicting as fuck and pretty rewarding on the brain. It could be something as simple as a sugar addiction that causes motivation loss. Why bother doing X task to get Y reward, when you can get Y reward for eating pretty much any processed western food and then chill.  

Keto diets tend to have very little sugar. As sugar is a good way to get too many carbs and break the ketogenic state.
I'd add to the hypothetical scenario that there's some pesticide in the water that makes women super horny! It's an extreme scenario where women are so horny they would rather date a lowly man or share than to be alone.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the impression I get from this sub is that men would just hoard women. I think they wouldn't like to share and they would build themselves harems and guard their harems. It's basically what was happening in tribal settings before monogamy. Women wouldn't necessarily flock to the top man, because by staying with a lower man with a smaller harem, they get more man time, so it's balancing the pros and cons.

Would it be the destruction of the family? Maybe men would choose a top woman to be their wife who bears his children. Then he would have many other women just for sex (and he could have all these women work to bring money home for the family while he doesn't have to do anything).
Or maybe he has a tummy ache again
Thanks.  Only way I got here was logging on at least 30 min a day to work the market.  I think I spent more time in the market than actually playing the game
The new shotgun status mod adds 22,5% status chance to the Hek's base of 25%. Most status and critical mods work this way, off of the base amount you have multiplicatively, instead of additively.

It still sounds like you should be triggering quite a few procs in so many shots though, so maybe there's something funky about how shotguns calculate status procs.
Lots of tags = smorgasbord of food for thought.. :)

This is a trap even married couples fall into eventually; you gradually develop a routine the both of you follow out of habit and expediency. The cure for that are many, but requires time and effort.. both of which are not easily available in this day and age.

Also, one thing I'd like to add (and those with relevant experience may agree with me), is that for divorcees/widows/widowers, the set sexual habits of a previous marriage may influence your sexual behavior in future relationships. I'm finding this out.. and it's a trap well looking out for.

This might also apply to everyone who's been in any (and all) kinds of long-term  relationships, though I can only speak from my (hetero-vanilla) experience. :)

Any idea as to why other than it's a casual match

Something that some of you might care about: If you get the album *by buying a bundle with a t-shirt or other item that purchase will not be counted on most if not all album charts.
A... A copyrighted color? How? Fine then. I copyright the color black. Give me all the money.
for me personally its because hentai, and 3d animations, had alot more "extreme" shit than regular porn. there is no limit to how fucked up porn can be when its entirely animated or comics, however there is limits on real porn with real people.

i would watch stuff like girls being raped by weird demonic monsters, gore stuff, girls with dicks (futanari) who don't like ugly and mannish like trannies, there would be over sized dicks like 30 inch cocks railing tiny girls, shit that is out of this world or defies the laws of physics making it way more crazy. tentacle rape is another good one.

i also got addicted to weird flash games people made involving this crazy shit, and source film maker animated porn. honestly, i even actually got into 3d art, pirated some programs, and made my own animations. i actually uploaded them to some popular sites . i got addicted to coming up with fucked up fantasies and then actually making them in animations or pictures, that is how far this got me.

yes, i do think the animated/cartoon world of porn is far more addicted and fucked up than regular porn. i was never that addicted to regular porn, but once all the limits of real life were removed, it consumed me, i became lost.

I went on the Revolution roller coaster at Magic Mountain and my lap restraint didn't lock into place. It was an old steel coaster even then and it features a loop. My friend was sitting next to me and he shit a brick when he saw. We both freaked out until we had cleared the loop and there was no ill effect. It was grad night in junior high. It must have been 1987.

They need to be kept separate 100% of the time. At least until you find a good solution and implement it to near perfect. They may need to be separated forever. It's a sucky situation but its not fair or safe for him to keep being put in harms way.
It says in the rule book that you can enter a pact without even knowing it.
If I were you I'd keep the Rift preorder no matter what.  I know people will think Im a jerk for suggesting this, but you could sell it on Ebay and probably get enough out of it to pay for the Vive.

Meh, life isn't really better in other cities. It's just different. I moved to NYC after college, and voluntarily moved back to Ohio. I like not having roommates, being done with work before 7, and not being an hour-long train ride from my gym.
hi
What city do the skyscrapers north of Mongolia represent? Ulan Ude? It's not exactly a metropolis.

And then the scyscrapers in the Russian Far East... there's literally no city there
you did not date before the 60s-70s
I absolutely agree.
Yeah that sucks man. Too many to be disconnects or distractions.

What annoys me is the snap-back to full screen. If the other player disconnects just leave their highway there. I'd rather that than lose my streak...
It's pretty simple for me. People who would rather see a woman die in the course of a doomed pregnancy than allow an abortion don't get my support. This goes for institutions (i.e. Catholic health care systems) as well as candidates.
F/5.6 is the sharpest f-stop on the 18-105, at least according to DXO mark. It softens up quite a bit at f/4. So the image would not be sharper, but it would be either taken with a faster shutter speed (better stopped action) or a lower ISO (less noise in the image). It would also have a thinner depth of field.

I would not disagree with you. I see them as quite similar but arguments can be made for either. The 55-210 shot might be a hair better, but it's not like the difference is huge, and brightness and contrast can be adjusted in post very easily. For this test I did not make any adjustments to ensure a fair comparison. There not identical, but the point was they are close, and the benefits of having a single lens that can go wide to narrow, all at a reasonable f-stop are, for a hobbyist shooter like me, significant.

Often I take pictures at various events where if I have to stop and change lenses the moment will be gone. I can say this: I started with the two kit lenses. Then I played with a lot of vintage manual focus stuff. Then my daughter started to run around and I got the 18-105mm and it's more or less the primary lens I have used since. I did get a 70-210mm adapted A-mount lens for wildlife and sports stuff, and I have vintage primes I use for specialist things (like the Rokinon 12mm for landscapes and astrophotography, and a 50mm f/1.4 for use when it gets dark), but the 16-50mm and the 55-210mm have seen no use since I got it other then breaking out the telephoto for this test.

&gt;congress and the dems keep shutting him down. 

That's cute. You must not be aware of the pact the GOP made before Obama even took office. 

&gt;The Republican plot to obstruct President Obama before he even took office, including secret meetings led by House GOP whip Eric Cantor (in December 2008) and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (in early January 2009) in which they laid out their daring (though cynical and political) no-honeymoon strategy of all-out resistance to a popular President-elect during an economic emergency. [“If he was for it,” former Ohio Senator George Voinovich explained, “we had to be against it.”](http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/23/the-party-of-no-new-details-on-the-gop-plot-to-obstruct-obama/)

Yet Obama still managed to get the ACA passed. Trump couldn't do that even with a Republican controlled congress.

And the Muslim ban was found to be unconstitutional. You can't blame "the Dems" for that, even though we all know you're going to try.

Hahaha, I just put the game down for good for precisely the issues that caused this shitfest to unveil. No IFFs, no way to make corps/guilds/groups, weak servers, shitty and unreliable "wing" system...the works.

The game lacks a lot of core features and the devs (and a big part of the community) refuse to admit it.

Armstrong Syndrome. One of your arms gains unnatural strength due to too many curls, arm wrestling matches, or masturbation. The syndrome is preventable by alternating usage of both arms.

A couple of local towns also have some fun names:

Salmon Arm Syndrome. After consuming too much fish, one of your arms slowly grows into a full Sockeye Salmon before leading you to a source of freshwater where it can detach and live the rest of its days. Your original arm does not grow back.

Vernon Syndrome. You feel an intense hatred of all young bespectacled boys with untidy black hair and the very idea of abnormal people. Weight gain is a common side effect and there is a chance of making terrible parenting decisions.

It's natural that you'd look at other vulvas (vulvae?) To see if yours is normal, but you, just like others aren't comfortable enough with yours to post it. Wouldn't it make sense to think that there are millions of other women who think theirs isn't worth posting? What you get is a porn-saturated perception of the vagina. Without porn normalizing it, wouldn't we associate a bald vulva with pedophilia? Let's just not underestimate how much porn has determined what we have decided is sexy. The reality is that when someone loves you, or heck, likes you a bunch, they will be overjoyed to see your meat curtains no matter how much they resemble drapery. Really, people do feel better after surgery but only in that one area and you probably want to feel more desirable in more ways than just your vulva. But on the flip side maybe surgery would actually help you distance yourself emotionally from the history of molestation. I'm guessing not enough, but maybe 12% is worth the effort. Also think about if someone is going down there for an extended visit, are you more uncomfortable with how you feel about them having you in such a vulnerable spot or if you're really going to just be thinking about how disgusted they must be with your vag. One may be protecting you from the other. Sorry for the thought slurry.

Don't play PQ before P4. It's silly to play a game meant to be fan-service before actually playing the games themselves. Half the references wouldn't even mean anything. That's like playing Dissidia before any Final Fantasy. 

And I recommend playing P5 last simply because the amount of overhaul in gameplay dynamics. It will make playing P3 and P4 really lackluster in comparison with the amount of things added. Each story is different, but gameplay is overall the same and enhanced each time, so going backwards will yield diminishing results.

I know how you feel. Congratulations! Looks like we're closing four days apart. :) My house is om 130th near Ambaum. Pretty good location, close to the 120 bus. How about you?

The house is a bit of a fixer-upper. The main floor is updated, but the upper floor and basement need some work, and the outside needs a new fence and a slap of paint. However, it's getting a new roof this week as a condition of the sale so that's amazing. I can do it bit-by-bit over time so I'm not worried. Very exciting! I work from home so I will have plenty of time to do work around the house; my boyfriend is looking for a WFH position himself so he can do the same.

Definitely let's be friends!

It was a good excercise in finding a solution to shit that just shows up and in finding out how shitty dealing with businesses is.  


My dad let me find the solution then told me that I needn't use it because he'd figured that would happen and my parents paid the deposit.

They're a pain! If you do main a warlock, I'd recommend the additional armor over the self-rez. The first three sword smashes you can make it through, and then when you take cover before the second attempt you can super up and have that overshield in place of the health you've lost. Usually helps out a lot! You'll get it for sure.

there is a difference between seeing it out of the corner of your eye and actually seeing exactly what went on. My thoughts are that the ref initiall saw Lowry go down out of the corner of his eye and thought that it was a bit of a tangle in which FBK was trying to slow play down (and hence the yellow for unsporting behaviour) from that possition it would have been hard for the ref to have seen FBK's kick. 

he then went to the assistant who would have been easily able to see the kick out as he has the same angle as we saw it. assistant tells the ref that it was a kick out and rightly deserves a red.

My apologies. After looking at STC-1000's for so long (I homebrew also) I automatically wrote that. It's actually an Inkbird temp controller, was 17.99 or so on Amazon. The way I have it wired is pretty straightforward. Hot, neutral, and ground from a monitor power cable. Hot is spliced from hot to terminal 1, and terminal 5, and to outlet that is going to be constant on. Neutral is spliced to terminal 2, and to heating outlet, and outlet that is constant on. Ground is simply spliced to both outlets. Temp probe connects to terminals 3 and 4. I use a 110 volt power supply that puts out 12 volts DC to power the fans. That's why I have the outlet for always on power, so I can run my fans all the time. Will try to come up with a drawing for you, probably going to be with MS paint though. Make sure that whatever insulated container you use is big enough to accept large egg turners. This cooler was bought from Amazon from some special promotion, for 24 bucks. It won't accept regular sized egg turners, so I have to use smaller ones. Only going to be doing a dozen or two at a time for a while, so it works. Other plans are to retrofit the box, and add an Inkbird humidity controller, with either a pond fogger, or a small humidifier to control the humidity levels more precisely. 
I'm in favor of the heat emitters over the light bulbs, but the more I look around, thinking about going with two ptc elements, mounted in front of the fans. Would take less room, and directly move the heat.
Quick edit: did the two fans and two heat sources strictly for redundancy. Read about a bulb blowing in the middle of the night, killing the eggs. I was told if you use bigger wattage heat sources (to a point) your temperature fluctuations will be shorter, ie: 120 watts gets you back to 100 degrees faster than 60 watts.
As far as holding heat, I have 4, individual quart Mason jars full of water, to help stabilize fluctuations in temperature. There will also be a tray with water and sponges to aid in humidity. Have been told about using clean rocks too. Idea being like an empty versus full fridge.

My school has a wonderful transfer center and a writing center to help me write the letter. I spoke with the director of the transfer center and even she was shocked I was denied, crazy stuff. 
The problem is that the appeals is to show there was something going on that hindered my ability to apply to the best of my potential. An example I found discussed the author's mother being diagnosed with cancer. That served the author an acceptance, but I have nothing of the sorts. I was thinking of discussing how my family has had financial struggles in the recent years and how I was unable to apply effectively because I was working to help provide. I don't know, honestly.

Saying you'll dedicate time over and above your usual hours if enough donations happen is NOT at all blackmail.  Not by any reasonable definition.   BESIDES WHICH: $1 would have done it, it was just that people got to choose whether he played his videogame or spent that extra time working on the book.  The videogame came with more author involvement in chat, for obvious reasons.  Now, he did make clear that he WANTED to play the videogame, but more than that he wanted to help poor people in Africa, so, if that would raise more money he was willing to spend an EXTRA THREE hours per day on the job, if more people wanted to do that.

Sure, Rothfuss might not be a well of social nicety, but he was willing to work three extra hours every day if people donated to charity saying he should.  Would you do that?  Would you be willing to sacrifice up to 3 hours per day of leisure to help people in Africa?  

Me? I'd...like to believe I would... It would totally depend...  And I volunteer a lot.

I would look forward to playing as a Blue Mage! Some of the best magic in the games, plus blue is such a calming and serene color. My # would be 94!
The reason you wouldn't run Super Vegito on that team is because he is relegated to being a floater. That makes the buff on his Super Attack useless and his counters lose value if attacks aren't loaded up on the 3rd slot while he is floating. Super Vegito is kind of garbage if he isn't in the 1st or 2nd slot. Without counters his damage is really lackluster.
No problem, enjoy!

This is one of the most exciting things I've heard in a while. I don't care either way! (but i lean towards buzzfeed length videos)
At least you're honest! Best of luck
No you're not. I completely understand your position. I'm terrified of the right, as much as you are, probably more so cause I live here and am an ethnic minority.
It doesn't specifically mention that that's the majority of it, not even that it's a sizable part of it, to be fair.

But if foreigners fighting out foreign disputes on European streets after decades of living here isn't a testament to the faillure of integration, I don't know what it.

Same story with our guild runs. The mage and healer got all the armors and Apollo. While us the dps get all the gold. 

If the game is no longer fun, I don't see a point in playing it. I don't care if it's RNGesus or Jesus, I play game for fun.
Create a made up story in my head and keep going till i find something to do.
As it currently stands, a Ryzen CPU is going to be the best price:performance ratio *if you are streaming from a single PC*. You get more cores *and* newer CPU architecture than an Intel offering (plus, the chipset Intel uses for its latest CPU line is being phased out so there isn't much "future proofing" to be had). I'm not sure what your budget is like, but a Ryzen 5 1600/1600x can be had for ~$200 and a Ryzen 7 1700/1700x will run about $300.

The "x" versions of Ryzen processors come with faster stock clocks, but the non-x versions are perfectly capable of matching these clock speeds and generally are $20-30 cheaper. Overclocking these days is basically increasing some numbers on your UEFI screen but it does generally void your warranty. That being said, Ryzen processors have been shown to be very OC-friendly even with the stock cooler they come with.

tl;dr a Ryzen 5 1600 that you OC on your own can easily hit 4.0 GHz on the stock cooler it comes with and can be found for $200. It's a great option for single PC streaming. If you're feeling extra ritzy, spring for a Ryzen 7 1700 or 1800 and again, do the OC yourself. 

It should be noted that, compared to Intel processors at similar price points, Intel does (on average) get slightly better framerates. You can look at the comparison benchmarks online, but its very a very small difference. Additionally, with more games taking advantage of DX12 and multi-core functionality AND with Intel phasing out its current cpu chipset, I think an AMD Ryzen cpu is the best option if you are upgrading and especially if you are streaming. The price:performance ratio cannot be beaten.
U r bad at replying to commentz
Not that I know of yet. 

Recon is relatively easy to explain however but it takes discipline in practice. Basically, you should buy infantry versions and place a couple of them in green-level cover that has high LOS (press C key to see the spot's LOS); and preferably they should not be directly with your frontline troops as they will tend to die by arty fire. Also make sure to press H so that they hold fire and remain undetected. Basically think of them as observation posts.

If you're on the offensive you may want a recon armored car or a recon squad that's mounting and dismounting from an armored car placed slightly ahead of your main force.

That said, this is really a game where you can do a bit of guesswork due to the frontline mechanic. With experience you can rely on them a bit less. There's a game posted here that was played by a couple of top players:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Steel_Division/comments/68am70/a_look_into_mobile_meta_vs_fussel_great_game_with/

And the thing to notice is how both players - while still relying heavily on recon - were also willing to risk units unsupported by recon to create rapid advances.

For infantry it really depends on the Division. Ersatztruppen for instance are basically speed bumps on the defense or bottom-tier guys that you send forward to make the enemy reveal their positions (10 points for the location of your MGs? Fine trade if you ask me!). At the top end you have Fallschirmjaeger which can basically beat any infantry one v one but will die just as fast to arty. And then you have Half-track infantry like in 3AD, which basically have to be conserved due to their scarcity but can beat a lot of infantry in specific terrain thanks to their HT fire support. 

As a general rule in defense against a player with lots of artillery though: Have only one infantry in the main line of resistance. If you're defending a hedge for instance, have only one infantry in that hedge (and usually the cheapest one). Have everything else be be _behind_ that hedgeline - preferably spread out in different cover locations. 

The idea here is that your lone infantry is acting primarily as a spotter and as a damage sponge. If the infantry spots an attack, you can call in your own arty and air to damage them. If the enemy decides to bombard your hedge, then you only lose that one infantry (if at all) while the rest of your forces are still intact. If faced with an overwhelming attack, then don't be shy about running - said attack will soon find itself facing concentrated fire from the rest of your forces the moment they enter the hedge; allowing you to break it up and re-take your original defense line.
Ahhh. I was thinking the San Diego NASL team was going for California United.
Being a depressed person makes me *loathe* this question. It's such an innocuous question, but it irritates me sometimes that the question actually has nothing to do with finding out how a person is truly doing. 

It's not like I'm searching for opportunities to unload what's on my mind, but there are days when that question almost makes me want to cry because there are days when I say I'm fine, or that I'm okay, and that response is such a fucking lie, and it just eats at me sometimes. 

I like where I'm working right now. The greeting I give or receive most days is "good morning", followed by absolutely nothing, and then everyone just goes to ~~the~~ their desk and gets back to work. And more often than not, the small talk I've engaged in hasn't started with "how are you", or "how was your weekend?"

I know it makes me sound kind of anti-social, but I love this dynamic I've got going on at work.

I am a girl, and my partner has a fissured tongue AKA a scrotal tongue and is actually embarrassed about it.  But what I've found out is that it feels amazing when he goes down on me and may be the best I've ever had, and his tongue makes me cum faster than any other partner has made me cum before.  I think that the fissures on his tongue may have something to do with this.  Has anyone else experienced this?  If so was your experience as good as mine?

Likely your OG measurement was inaccurate. On partial-boil extract kits, it is nearly impossible to evenly mix the wort and top-off water, so the gravity readings are off a non-homogeneous sample.


I would assume your OG is the same as listed in the recipe -- unless you failed to top off to exactly 5 gallons.

Ya it does but meditation is only one tool. Education is another major tool but our society doesn't bother to teach us stuff like antianxiety tricks in school. Anxiety builds when love is absent. Approach people with love instead of fear. If anxiety builds, increase the potency of the love channeling regardless of who you are talking to (whether you think they deserve love or not).

&gt; What i meant by katakuri v zoro/sanji is, i don't want oda to go zoro v katakuri and 1 slash KO katakuri just like what he did to pica

Zoro defeated Pica easily because Pica was a rather weak foe. Katakuri is not. Zoro wouldn't one-shot Katakuri in a solo fight. Ironically, Zoro and Sanji fighting together would make it even more easy to one-shot the guy.

I was a police officer for some years and saw a few people who took their jobs way too seriously.  The department did a pretty good job of hiring but every now and then a "real" doozy would slip by them...and into my life back then.  It was always some white guy of medium build and not a native of the city.  They showed up for their first day outfitted with every possible contrivance they could fit onto their service belt...like Batman. 
They were usually humorless pricks with a distaste for tomfoolery.  They only "kidded around" when they had to.  When the butt of a practical joke, they'd sometimes lose their cool.  Plus they were borderline aggressive in their official duties; sometimes enforcing minor infractions no one else bothered with or arresting the "local flavor" such as the friendly town drunk or the homeless woman.  I usually didn't care for these types of guys.
Tyene thanked Jeyne for the drink and took a large sip in agreement before replying. "I do. Watching people come and go, talking with all manner of guests." She waved her wine around. "Less...noble than these, but no less interesting." Working in *Nate's* and the *Cauldron* had introduced her to most of her current connections, including Jon. That was not to be dismissed without thought. "When did you come in?" she asked, her interest piqued. "No offense m'lady, but I do not remember, yet you seem to remember me."
Yes, there will be keycard checks at most of the hotels. Bally's won't. I haven't stayed at the other boardwalk hotels recently, but some others might not. You mentioned your top pick was the Borgata, where they are nearly religious about them. There will be a guard wanting to be flashed a card.

8 to a room is tight! Consider whether 2 rooms are in order. 4 to a room is very comfortable...

Okay, so when you check in, ask for three keys (or more). Either admit there are 3 or 4 people in the room or, if you ask for 3, say that you want one for your wallet and one for your pocket. They really, really don't care.

Give out the keys to other people and then go back later asking for a replacement key because you locked yours in your room. They'll give you another key. Do this twice if you want.

The guard will let several guests in with one key. 4 to a key is not suspicious. 5 to a key still won't raise eyebrows.

Curious, do you feel like Elite Dangerous captures that wonder of the original? Do you feel if the game was currently released as a stand alone like the original, would it be worthy of the title?

I played Frontier long long ago and my old PC could barely run it. I didn't end up doing much or going that far, but the feeling of how BIG of a game it was totally impressed me. I have a similar feeling now where I'm so overwhelmed by how BIG this game feels; I'm truly impressed with all E:D has to offer.

You know, certin religions and sects having dress codes has never really bothered me (except for one group around my house because the women dress conservatively but they guys walk around in wife beaters, ripped jeans, and dirty ball caps). I mean secular society is always imposing rules on dress style. You wouldn't wear sandals, shorts, and a t-shirt to a formal dinner or a business suit to the beach. So if a group has a dress code i don't see it as being intrusive and evil any more than i see being required to dress up to go to work as being evil.

After Enable's tweet about his PS4, I looked at the team and player performances from that side all weekend and:

Team's playing with that PS4 had an overall record of 3-9.

The player's overall k/d on that PS4 (assuming it was the same all event) was .896.  I didn't bother with k/r.

Enable's k/d was .83 (bad PS4) vs 1.05 when he played on another PS4. His k/r was 19.44 (bad) vs 23.15 (other PS4).  Faze need work but it's always going to be tougher when one of your consistent players is underperforming to that extent. It creates a chain reaction.

I see. I think i'm pretty intrigued by Dinesh, and his view points. I'd be pretty interested in his writings personally.
Thanks for the response! I actually have SLX on my trail bike, and I don't mind them. I would have to buy a bleed kit, as I only have a SRAM bleed kit. The on/off feel of them isn't my favorite on steep stuff, but overall it might be worth still.
They nerfed it a week after it came out I think but not recently though

Witnessed some guys doing communication wiring for data servers in a big pharmaceutical plant, it was interesting watching them have to lay all the wires out, then organize them and tie them all up. 

To answer your question though, it does take some time to get it all perfect looking like that
Thanks for the heads up. We (or I) kinda chickened out on going. I want to be super outdoorsy but I'll be realistic. I'm a total city girl. I appreciate it from where we are and don't mind driving through but the snow makes me nervous and I don't even know if there is snow up in that area so we went to Ensign Peak 😁
I send them my product for free since it takes me a few mins to make and only costs me about 50 cents each product. From there I offer them a promotional code and whenever someone uses it, I pay them 20% commission. I do this because if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have gotten that sale on my own. So that's $20 let's say that I made because of them, so I don't mind paying them. And if they see money coming in and that I do indeed pay them, they'll continue promoting my products and I'll get nice pictures to use on Etsy too

Thank you!
Love the out of control colors going on here.
Hey what?
Especially for ridiculous reasons.
&gt;Wow this would be a major improvement but it would be a monumental project to dig up all of the sidewalks and roads needed to bury the cables.

Ikr, finally! I think they already moved the cables down underground in some areas also.

We'll have to see how it plays out with the traffic. Revamping the 
 buses like in [Khon Kaen](https://www.facebook.com/kkcitybus/) would defenitely help convince more middle/upper-middle class people to use them more. Hopefully the BMTA will do that soon.
Oh hey, Renee and Dean!
She's a pretty girl, but she lacks the *je ne sais quoi* to be a model, even if she were a decade younger.  

I wish she'd make amends with that and do something more meaningful and fulfilling with her life.
There was a cruise ship in dock today and it left around 4 pm - they will often have the fire boats 'salute' them as they depart.
Just buy a bunch of Stella Artois or something probably. Or whatever the cheapest non twist off green bottled beer you can buy is. I don't think I've ever seen green bottles for sale and if you try to go wholesale or something you would probably need to buy a ridiculous number of them
I wasn't criticizing the post. It's more of an irony in the show since no one ever acknowledges the land of waves mission and underestimates team 7
I find Katie's voice to be very MKE-ish
Marijuana is bad for you
How much storage does it have? 16 GB = slower processor.
Why would I want to practice retaining information that I can just Google at any time?
If you don't take away free speech, the terrorists win.
LMFAO
Don't get me wrong, it's where my mind went too. That's when I thought more of it.
Oh sure. Depends on the game. You're definitely the scrappy underdogs fighting the lumbering tyrants when you play SEC, but we don't get that blue blood establishment hate.
I can sort of relate to that feeling, I *love* getting character development, don't get me wrong, but at the cost of half an episode? not really. (of which we get 12 until god knows when, to add salt to the wounds) I have no issues with the anime otherwise

I don't know how the manga handled character development, so there may have been the same "issue" there, but the monthly schedule of the releases always keeps you looking forward, unlike the four years in the dark we will probably spend again

This is my personal view on the issue, I really liked how they handled Levi's development with OVAs tho
Beautiful elbow
But it does make it a much more insignificant part of a Reform Jew's present and future.
Oh damn...well I've made a mistake.
You do realize that the trophy gets updated during the next update, right? Or do you just enjoy whining without the facts?

"Please allow us" could easily be interpreted as asking riot for it. Riot are the only entity capable of allowing it. If he stated "I believe we should be able to" and then continued with his idea, it would not be addressed to riot.
I know this isn't *your* excuse, and you're just repeating Funcom's words... but "clipping issues" is the most limp-dick excuse for crippling character creation ever.  I refuse to believe it.  There's no reason that a particular nose can't be used unless you also agree to use the specific cheeks, chin, and mouth that go with it.  There's no possible way that simply combining features is going to solve clipping issues when most of the options still exist.

&amp;nbsp;

The only possible reason to do this is for them to limit the amount of faces available, as combined models, so that fewer resources are used.
I think they fish for complements.

Peanut butter fucking disgusting.
Awe thanks :)
That ought to be a good car. I've got a rather old 330d (51 plate - 2.9L 135KW 5 speed manual) and I like it very much. I bought it six years ago, expecting to keep it for maybe 3-4 years, but I've still got it, and have no real intention of changing it, at least not until they make pre-Euro 6 diesel cars illegal and/or it rusts into nothing.

The engine is a bit rough, but I actually quite like that - you can feel it's a bit rough at 900rpm, and then you can feel it's a bit rough at 1200rpm, and then you can still feel it's about as rough as that (and barely more) at 4000rpm. Never gets old, for some reason.

Main problems are the rather average 0-60 time, and the plumes of thick, gelatinous, jet-black clag it spits out from the exhaust when you try to attain even that. Also, my car is silver, and who the fuck wants a silver car? But the latest engines fix the acceleration and smoke problems, and your car is a rather attractive shade of blue ;) - so what, as the saying goes, is not to like. Nothing, I should think, that's what.
Tanks. Lots of really big tanks.
That's not true, because voice callouts do not give a visual indicator, and it's much faster to press a button than to say things. It's also easier to understand if any of your teammates have a strong accent or don't speak the same language, which is especially notable in EU.

Calling for healing via a button is much faster than using a mic.
It's ok if you wanna be Trans, no judgement here. Just be yourself
It's crazy that bray Wyatt is so mystical that he can make it dark out in certain parts of San Jose at 6:32 pm in April.
A summons for jury duty. On my birthday. 

Great fucking gift if I do say so myself, but you don't happen to have a gift receipt for this do you?
Are the New York families really gonna let that un-American thug into their house?
&gt; In snow removing a set of rear wheels let's your back end dig down more to find traction instead of just floating on top of the loose snow.

Makes sense.  Is it as simple as pulling off a pair of tires, or do you have to put on some kind of spacer or something?  Which pair comes off: inside or outside?  Also, is there a tire or rim difference between the inside and outside pair?  (Apologies for my ignorance in this area; it's my first dually.)

&gt; The studded snows are more safe in generally cold winter weather, then when conditions are bad enough that you can't go much more than 30 anyway, you put on your chains.

Also makes sense, but I haven't generally had an issue with traction in anything but conditions which necessitate slower speeds anyway.  I'm usually driving slower than I need to in adverse conditions.  If this is the case, is there a really compelling reason why I should still get studs?  I'm told that it impacts the overall life of the tire.  That, combined with the issue of legality in other states, makes me want to avoid it unless I have a need.  I *have* gotten stuck once this winter, but it was off the road in 2 feet of snow.  I'm thinking chains would have been better than studs there, anyway.

Cheaper by the dozen, when the dad dies.
Looks kinda like Elizabethan upper-class fashion with all of the stuff that's unpleasant to modern eyes taken out. I'm no expert on fashion history, though I do know a fair bit about Victorian menswear.
The power has not shown the future before in any cannon material. I am unsure about the EU but I suppose that's irrelevant. It would seem to fit that it's possible, maybe Rey's connection to that vision had an effect. 

I agree that the lightsaber wouldn't have still been near Rey after the ship left. In the Hunt for Ziro episode Quinlan Vos is able to walk around in the vision, possibly explaining that.
You haven't played very many ps1/ps2 era rpgs if you think that is the worst voice acting. 

I'd wager that you're being hyperbolic either intentionally or because you just don't like the game. There are so many better examples of actual bad voice acting.
IMO adding IRL was a mistake. Twitch is a gaming website first and foremost. The second you allow people to have such free streaming you open yourself up to a pandora's box of problems. The whole reason they added it in the first place was to deal with the people who would basically have a game in resolution 600x400 while they talk to viewers. They hated having to police so many streamers to make sure they were playing gaming content but this was not the answer. Think about all of the cancerous streamers, a whole lot of them are IRL (ice poseidon, tyler1, greek, andy milonakis, etc). What blows my mind further is the people who watch IRL sections. It's like reality TV but twice as boring. 



IRL section rewards streamers who put themselves in awkward and dangerous situations. When a streamer harasses a citizen minding his own business and it creates a scene, it's considered funny and pulls in more viewers and donation money. It's just sad.
Wow, pretty cool dakimakura. I like all three, but the bottom two seem a bit too well endowed. Nice waifu haul.
Now I have less guilt about the US dropping those bombs. Shit needed to stop asap. I love visiting Japan and their precision culture, but when something that brutal and efficient isn't showing signs of slowing, you gotta beat them submission with greater intensity than they can muster.
He gave us his leftovers that he had put in a togo box when I walked into a sushi joint with a low level minor leaguer he recognized. He was AA/AAA at the time. Super nice guy.
Shut up Daryl
... if I run this deck, is it technically illegal because I know the exact order of my deck?
Nice! So far what I do is use a guide to do the sidequests, and then just figure out the main quest on my own. It's a lot of fun though. I do know I've missed a ton but I can't figure out how...
Well Lynn in Buffalo had super mobile QBs.
Well, I just did this (from ON) so here are my thoughts:

- Agree with u/FJCruiserMT that now is not the time to be adding to your fixed costs. 

- Not sure that leasing a vehicle and driving it cross country is a great idea. At least finance it so it's yours. JMO

- You only have to pay a damage deposit. Not first and last.

- I doubt you'll have much luck finding a place from Nfld. Honestly it's hard to find a place once you're here, particularly while you're unemployed. But you have to have some faith, both in others and in yourself. I was lucky and found a landlord who was willing to take a chance on me. And then I found a job a week later and almost wish I had waited for a better unit. IMO you should save as much $ as you can in the event you can't find an apt quickly. But finding a job should be do-able. Unless you're going to a really dead area, there are jobs here.
I wouldn't know. My ideology isn't based on identity politics, so I just see two people together, not a white one and a black one.

OMG it's "fatman"
I dislike a lot of people for no good reason. Some people I just look at them and I'm like "nah." I'm not actively mean to anyone though.

Well yes like I said there was credibility to that, but to such a dramatic extent the adpocalpse can not be underestimated. Prestigeiskey did a short video about milk. It had like a quarter of the views and four times the ad revenue or something like that? That's pretty dramatic.

It's smoother to let things happen naturally. Show, don't tell.
yeah, don't go crazy google.
Where can I watch the post match Strowman vs Reigns beatdown? Was there more after it went off air, because the network won't let me continue past him refusing to go on the stretcher.

No, but we had [those too](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Automated_tournament) and they were fought in guild halls rather than mode specific arenas. Heroes Ascent wasn't automated and the wait in HoH could be quite long before GW2 came out due to lack of opposition at certain times.

I think there is a very clear left-wing bias. They do a better job of removing bias than most other sources IMO, but on articles on things pertaining to current events you always see that bias come out (minimum wage, gay marriage, global warming, etc).

btw theres even an article in wikipedia where it talks about its left wing bias, and that as it increases it's number of writers the bias has become reduced.

How are you able to deduce that attraction to waist to hip ratio is instinctive but attraction to breasts is not.

Also I never said or argued that humans find breasts sexy because they see them as a sign of ovulation or something like other animals. 

But I easily can argue that breasts can indicate fertility by way of demonstrating health like skin/hair quality. Breasts can simply demonstrate that a female has sufficient fat reserves and access to food to be able to birth a child (which is the reason you give for men being instinctively attracted to larger waist sizes).

I'm curious which one is more difficult to battle.
I-O!!!
I saw it called heteroflexable and homoflexable once, and I feel like it works really well. 

I'm a straight woman and could never see myself dating a woman that isn't really masculine or something, but I get sexually excited by women but i get really uncomfortable when it comes to actually kissing or touching. 

I'd would be misleading to call myself gay or bisexual even though I'm definitely attracted to women. 

I think everyone had their own level of fluidity in sexuality. It makes no sense that we can be so well genetically engineered but only have two or three sexual, gender or romantic options.
Any chance it also includes the other open stem or the silicon sleeve?
Tsunade and Sakura are two people with a vast difference in battle experience between them. Sakura is not a clone of Tsunade, she is less. Tsunade used medical ninjutsu in battle in part one (lightning chakra messed up Kabuto's CNS). Kabuto exceeds her as well (chakra scalpel in battle). Sakura hasn't shown the kind of creativity that would tell me that she she can tackle challenges as they come. Naruto and Sasuke do this. They have also battled many people and showed us that they can develop creative uses of their abilities. Sakura simply masters the technique as it is invisioned.

Sakura may have the yin seal, but note that when someone has an essentially immortal body they become sloppy in their fighting style. Raikage told Tsunade this in their battle against Madara. If Sakura is forced to use her Yin Seal - which implies that she is getting hit without being able to land one on her opponent - then she likely becomes a sloppy fighter. Note that neither Tsunade nor Sakura just whip out the Yin Seal in battle. The battle has to have advanced enough for them to use it.

We see how Sakura battles a long-ranged opponent in her fight against Sasori. Her strategy is to dodge attacks at first, tank them if she can't, and get in a solid hit with her fist. That is her only attack. She has no other attack ability. How will she battle someone like Mei? Madara noted that he couldn't get hit by that level of ninjutsu as that spells trouble for him. Mei showed strategy in that she trapped Sasuke and used the acid mist on him. Sakura's strategy is creating infighting in teams. She misleads her opponents into thinking they have the upperhand (against Sasuke) or letting them believe they have outsmarted her (against Ino, which backfired).

Sakura hasn't used Katsuyu in any attack capability.

The issue is she simply not experienced enough to after Kage-level. She may have surpassed Tsunade according to characters in the manga, but she still cannot defeat Tsunade. There is Mei as well.

PS: I am not hating on her. I am trying to understand her capabilities and what she and other ninjas have to offer. Getting a punch on Kaguya is not proof of ninja ability. She helped Naruto and Sasuke seal her, but did not defeat her. Kaguya couldn't be defeated. Only sealed.

TL;DR: Sakura is not a creative ninja and not one that can tank ninjutsu abilities that even Madara didn't want to get caught in. Mei is superior to her. If she can't tank Mei's ninjutsu, then she can't get that hit in. And it looks like the Kage's all have high durability getting wacked around by Susano, so Sakura's hit might not be an end-all.

You will only have this time with your child once.  A month is a RIDICULOUS amount of time for them to expect to be hosted.  Even if they're staying in a hotel, still ridiculous.  I'm a recovering people-pleaser, so I truly get that it can be difficult to assert boundaries, but may I kindly suggest that you worry less about being gentle and polite with her?  It's possible to be kind, but firm.  If she's going to be upset regardless, you may as well make sure your point gets across.  

My mom was intrusive and horrible to my husband when my second child was born.  I told my sisters all about it, and the next one of them to have a baby (her first), simply told my mom that they were going to take that time to bond as a family unit.  I'm still annoyed at some of the stuff mom pulled - 14.5 years later - but my sister made the wise choice to spare herself that.

This was really recent. At a tech rehearsal for my school's musical, there were these two girls who would always crowd around the sound booth and annoy me and my crew. They would always talk to a girl on my crew about random crap, and when I asked them to leave, they would always give me this glare and continue talking. I'm a junior, and those two girls are freshmen, so it was really frustrating that they weren't listening. On this particular day however, I was through with their shit. It was about 9 in the morning and those two girls were annoying my crew while we were setting up. I asked them nicely, out of desparation to just leave me and my crew alone for the duration of rehearsal until showtime, but they said, "We're never going away, and there isn't anything you can do about it," followed by the same, smug smirk across their ugly faces. I couldn't take anymore of this. It was too early in the day, and I was sick and tired of this happening. My face turned very red, and I yelled as loud as I could, "GET THE FUCK OUT! GET. THE. FUCK. OUT! I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU TWO ANYWHERE NEAR MY CREW AGAIN OR ELSE THIS WILL BE YOUR LAST FUCKING REHEARSAL EVER! YOU TWO HAVE BEEN THE MOST AGGRAVATING PEOPLE I'VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! NOW FUCK OFF!" The two girls were dead quiet, and their crew head, who was nearby, told them to leave me and my crew alone. Apparently I was so loud that everyone in the hallway I was in heard it, and for about an hour, most of them stayed away from me.

the difference is that men crave sex with 90% of the women and women crave sex with 10% of the men. A woman would prefer to spend the night alone than have sex one night stand with a man who is not extremely good looking.
A man would prefer to have sex with a woman who is not very attractive rather than spend his night alone. Female and male sexuality is different.

Because there was no point in having a middle-level of armor. The ship-caliber guns were so large that anything less than the super-heavy armor they put on vital parts would be almost as useless as no armor. Also, fully armoring the ship to that heavy level would have added hundreds of thousands of pounds to the ship, slowing it down and making it far less maneuverable. They realized this and decided to compromise, heavily armoring vital parts and essentially leaving the non-vital parts unarmored. So they called it "all or nothing" because the parts of the ship could either have "all" the armor and be protected from fire or have "nothing" and sacrifice armor for weight reduction and maneuverability. Hope this helps!

To be fair every time someone kills themselves the automatic reaction is 
"look at all these signs" 
"look what they were saying online" 
"They were crying out for help" 
Then you see stories where one stranger's kindness was what kept someone from killing themselves, so not to rip on you or harp on you, but just from the other perspective, it may be obnoxious but if it can literally help one person in that situation it's kind of worth it.

I'm not a doctor (far from it!) so I can't help with a diagnosis, but if she isn't feeling any better with the medicine she is on from her "natural health center" I would suggest she get a second or even third opinion. Maybe just convince her to see a legit, licensed primary care doctor and see what he or she thinks. While all the symptoms she shows can be different than just Parkinson's (for example, Fibromyalgia, Lyme's disease, Lupus, Essential Tremor, etc), she at least deserves to get proper care for whatever her condition may be.

Thank you.

Also IMO the insistence on calling any kind of orgasm that extends beyond the penis/genitals as a "girlgasm" is going to lead many to believe that experiencing a whole body orgasm with a penis is an automatic sign that they are trans, by making a false-positive case for dysphoria.  It enforces the same rigid and outmoded gender/sex roles that cause problems for trans people to begin with.  It'd be problematic in exactly the same way as saying enjoying nipple-play is for "girls" only. Or anal play for penis-havers is only for gay men.

Feel free to argue differently though.

You're right though, I didn't really read the comment I replied to, I just agreed with the sentiment that most people reading it won't really understand what it means. 

It's much darker, more confronting and deeper than what this sub is ready for.

I wish I can go back in time and fall in love with biking all over again like you are.  It's really really hard to go back to driving once you start biking and you can really see and sense the Portland streets and neighborhoods.

Taking the lane is much safer and you're better seen approaching intersections (where most crashes happen).  To be clear, I'm talking about roads without marked bike lanes like greenways and residential side streets.

&gt; In the ME the monks and canons in the cathedral schools were learning the bible, canon law, philosophy, theology and maybe some mathematics (if they were lucky) and if you were interested, even some medicine. Now that's not particularly the paragon of empirism, don't you think?



I would say it depends on the time. Aspects of Empiricism (or the concepts that would later become Empiricism) were integrated into a Catholic philosophy/method of thought by Thomas Aquinas.



In addition, this is for monastics, effectively the guys who the the people who effectively spend most of their time in religious contemplation (the people who will most have their heads in the "bronze age books"). 

Clerics Regular (ordered priests) and Frairs were more likely the ones to do scientific research, as their vocation to serve God tended to be expressed in more "direct" ways.


&gt;We REALLY have to wait for the dawn of the 16th century for the first notably scientific accomplishments in Europe.

 

Accomplishments such as what, distinguishing them from the previous centuries?



Also, if we are going with scientific advances circa 16th century, the Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributers to expirimental physics in the 17th century".

It was all about walking the straight line within the very narrow boudaries of theological doctrine: THIS is how you must think and if not, you are a heretic. And the peasants and shepherds of Montaillou weren't even infidels or pagans - they just adhered to Catharism, another flavour of Christianity.



Thats not neccessarily better under Christian ethos.
&gt; my place in it would be pointless since I have next to no experience compared to them.

Dude, don't ever say this again. You are as valid as the rest of them. 

There's always going to be folks with waay more experience, even when you're at a top level - that's just life.

Everyone starts somewhere. You gotta do just that.

Don't break the bank, prove to yourself that you're interested in the instrument and can remain so, and if over time you still love it then upgrade as you can afford.

As for the band thing, well it might not work with you starting from zero, but it might, depends what kind of band it is. Punk was pretty much everyone starting from zero and nobody giving a shit.
The only thing that seemed to work was a mepps double blade spinner size 3. The blade color didn't seem to matter but white tails got the most strikes!
"hardcore" players will say this isn't a bug, it's normal. You vaporized a bag/chest/table without taking stuff out of it, and the stuff got vaporized? Lesson learned then. 

It would make the game lame if it tried to hold the user/players hand by either dumping the contents on the ground, or giving an error message like "stuff inside cant destroy." 80% of the gameplay of this game is managing reagents an materials and intimately knowing your tools and workshop.  

Unless theres some enchanment you can cast on items so that they're aware of their contents and shout "no I'm full! also plz don't destroy me I have a wife and kids," when you try to destroy them, why would a chest/table know or care or behave that way? 

&gt; as that's kinda bullshit.

Not in a game like Citadel its not, it makes sense that destroying a container destroys whats inside it. In a game like World of Warcraft, or Barbie Pony Adventure where the goal is to make sure the users feelings aren't hurt, it would be bullshit. 


**DEVELOPERS LOOKIE HERE** EDIT:  just to be clear, when I was typing out that part about an enchantment on ingame items that makes them act sentient and tell you what they have in them or not to destroy them, I was leaning more towards "cool shit that would work well in this game." and less towards being a sarcastic asshole. I literally think you guys should embrace the cartoon aesthetic, and include spells for animating/enchanting inanimate objects, to take commands like tames, and make the game world more magicky. It fits with the fantasy theme you've got going on so far, think 'Fantasia' with the army of brooms. Theres a VR game out by the people behind rick and morty called "Accounting" and it has this tree person yelling at you to get out of his tree world, thats another good reference, I want to make doors that say "Hey, who goes there?" and chairs that walk away from you saying "No please, not again." and Wall Torches that ask if it's warm in here. I mean, don't worry about this sort of candy coating cosmetic stuff right now, but I see the potential for it in this game.
Very astute observation.
If they fuck up a pie chart like this, I can't help but disregard any of their "findings".  They're probably wrong as well.

I consider $25 to be a lot to pay for a pair of shoes that my kid will outgrow in 3 months or less.

However, I consider $100 to be a fairly reasonable amount for quality hiking boots that will hopefully last me at least a few years.

Technically speaking, the only potion players can buy is a Potion of Healing. Everything else is classed as a magical item and magical items cannot be bought by the base rules of D&amp;D.

So it's a bit problematic to even find a price let alone allow them to buy potions at all. If you want to, I'd probably use the magical item creation rules and double the creation price.

Basic Income is 100% unavoidable. The Robots are coming, and they will take 80% of all jobs in the world and then some. There simply will not be enough employment under our current system.

That being said, everything that people warn against with Basic Income can be a problem with Basic Income. The devil is in the details and the implementation matter, the cost matters, the amount matters and the culture matters.

Sure. The atmosphere and general vibe was way more laid back and better for me than BJ or SH. The sidewalks in the downtown busier areas are much wider than BJ, SH or HK and therefore I'm not constantly having to avoid bumping into people. For me that is important because I'm so big and people haven't seen me and have bumped into me and have fallen over a dozen times. Very stressful.

In person, online or both? I'm in my second year of grad school moved into a house last semester and had a baby in Aug. I work 40 hrs. It's tough. I have to have help with baby and chores (boyfriend steps up). So far only had one face to face class per semester (1.5 to 3 hr class per week).

If you want it, you can make it happen. We only live once. It will never get easier. Just do it. And honestly masters classes are easier than undergrad. There are 3 papers per semester per class on average for me (masters in clinical mental health counseling) but writing is a strength of mine. The rest of the work are either chapter quizzes or discussion posts about a chapter.

If u have questions ask me.

It's a terrible article that doesn't make a coherent point, but you do make a good one.
Theoretically Uber drivers and AirBnB operators will realise that they're not making as much money as they could/should be elsewhere...
I don't know about peaked, but definitely the Kamoshida arc had some huge oomph to it. 

Going from that to Madarame was a noticeable drop, as other than some rumors here and there you don't seem to have much of a reason to go after him (heck, later on in the game there are scenes with Yusuke where he's wondering if taking down Madarame was even a good idea). Then the next few arcs feel like excuses to get you into a dungeon each time: you're forced by Makoto to go after Kaneshiro, Futaba's feels like you're playing persona 4 with the whole "facing yourself" stuff while the mechanics are still phantom thief stuff, and in Okumura's half the characters don't even want to get involved at all until Morgana essentially forces you in. 

The last 3 felt more "essential", but never at the do-or-die level of Kamoshida's, despite the plot providing you with higher stakes.

The Official Reprint Policy last changed when the prohibition on foil reprints was added. Prior to that, it was the 8th Edition changes where a bunch of cards were removed (most notably Juggernaut, Kird Ape, Clone, Sol Ring and Underworld Dreams).

Before that it was changed all the time and there's not online archived versions of the old lists. Time Warp, Exploration and Living Death were all on it at one point, then removed without fanfare.

Can confirm, just got insanely lucky in the old Town area. Wife and I bought a house for 300+. Houses right now are going for more and more because inventory is nowhere near the demand. If OP moves I wish him/her luck. They will need it given the fact that people are buying without looking. 

Additionally OP, traffic is not that bad comparatively, people complain when they are inconvenienced. I'm no different, but like some other posts said it's nothing like bigger cities. The bridges are a gamble. 

In terms of culture and the town, there's something for just about anyone. Whether you want the southern frat star life or the hipster scene you can find it. It's hard to get a bad meal too. Deep history and beautiful access to nature.

Yep. Also, the British Isles are technically part of the continent - the continental crust is one big piece, some of it is just covered up with water right now. Didn't always used to be, Great Britain and Germany [used to be connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland). The Thames and the Rhine met in the middle and flowed out what is now the Strait of Dover.
He should've told him...but you don't need permission to date someone. He should've sat down and told him that he was starting to see his ex, and that it isn't to embarrass or upset him, but because they're friends and they like each other. The ex doesn't get to decide who she dates.
I have noticed that British/European teens/pre-teens seem to be more well-mannered that typical American teens. It's the way they are raised. Sadly a majority of American teens receive no discipline, because their parents are afraid the child will call CPS on them.

The bloodrager doesn't have the specific line calling out a lower caster level like the paladin and the ranger, thus I would rule that CL=character level.

The power went out one night while I was in the middle of playing BotW. If this was any other console I would've been done, but I just took the Switch out of the dock and played in handheld mode until the power came back an hour and a half later. It also doubled as a light source to help me find my way around the house. It was glooorious.

Thank you! Your advice definitely helped ❤️
I don't think that's the case. She was at the jail, the guy asking about her is not someone that was questioning her, and the kick her loose and be apologetic wouldn't make sense. If you're being questioned and not charged with anything you don't need permission to leave.

It's not terribly graphic, but it IS someone getting shot in the back a few times and dying. No gore really, but he def lifted his head up between shots 4 and 5, so it's not a super quick death. Fair warning.

A colon before a quote can be grammatically correct and a great way to introduce a quote, especially a big one, so "the other English I teacher" is just plain wrong.

Shut it down..
Interesting toons to try with this comp (mostly either a double tap or assist call on basic)
Fives, Dengar (need someone with a debuff on basic), Aayla, Boba, Greedo, Imperial super commando (inflicts offense down), Jawa, Sabine. Leia could also be great if you somehow don't have an Omega on her basic.

Others that might work well include TFP, Raid Solo (bonus damage to enemies with &lt;50% tm), Ugnaught, FOST with Zeta , Kylo (would do more damage for each time he's hit and if others died before enrage and he got to attack, could hit insanely hard from the DoT),  Mace (self heal if below 50%), Shore or Sunfac (for crit chance down), Nebit (for protection up), Pao (multi attacks).

Other ideas, Use tenacity up so people don't get DoT. Then if people die and you get turns before enrage, then rest won't instantly die. With tenacity up, Ezra could be good. If you have, say Ezra and/or Sabine you could also try chopper to provide additional buffs.

I work in food retail. Our milk section and reduced section share the same fridge. A coworker had put too much milk in because there were no reduced items, and a few were left over the reduced shelf sticker. A customer came over asking what the milk was discounted by, and I ran it through the till and told her it appeared not to be reduced in price. She went crazy about false advertising blablabla, and I told her it was probably a mistake on our part, or some other customer could have just put the milk back there after picking it up. *BLA BLA BLA IM GOING TO REPORT YOU*, so I reduced the price of the milk by one penny and gave her a stern look.

Events are actually calculated so that getting the base/free sr takes the same amount of lp.

As far as healers go, I'd avoid the combo and perfect ones, because if you're getting a long combo or a lot of perfects you shouldn't need a healer team :P note-based are usually best, and timer-based isn't too bad unless you're tanking expert.

Looks like a recently-manufactured decor item, probably mass produced in Italy.
That's just it. It's NOT impossible. I think he won't sign with OKC, but I also see if he wants to stay in LA, he must take a paycut. 

BG has a lot to consider this offseason, and the way things ended this year don't help him getting priority in LA, or getting big money from other teams. 

If anything, he probably opts in his final year if another team doesn't come along offering him some deal in the area of $100mil+

It's all speculation at this point. But if he met with Presti and wanted to explore options, the Thunder could make it work financially. Presti might opt out, but still, they aren't constrained to make it impossible as you posit.
The friend would probably have a very hard time coming up with reasons why EVERY one of his characters are a murder hobo.  So go ahead and KILL THIS ONE and let him reroll.  Obviously this specific character is courting death with his attitudes.  Thats fate/karma/whatever.

&gt;It's clear that Antifa are acting like the very group they claim to hate: the Brown Shirts of Hitler. I'm not talking about any groups who may have fought against them, I'm talking about the fact that Antifa's tactics exactly match the very group they hate.

EVERYONE'S tactics match the group they are are fighting, unless they have a superior tactic available to them. 

"They bombed Pearl Harbor, so we bombed them? We are the REAL monsters!"

"Oh my god, the police are in the street with weapons, making a scene! They're just as bad as the gang they're fighting!"

&gt;Additionally (in all fairness I did edit my last comment, so maybe you missed it) - the Antifa are not fighting actual Nazis like what your grandfather did.

You mean they're not fighting Nazis with an army behind them? They are fighting the same ideology. And tell me, as clearly you think their tactics are too extreme -- how many people has antifa killed so far? How many people have Neonazis killed?

&gt;And, again - don't sully your grandfathers reputation by putting these cowardly Antifa on the same plain as him. Remember, your grandfather would have also had great disdain for these largely socialist/communist/Marxist/Leninist sympathizers.

My Jewish Grandfather died with a bumper sticker that said "Fuck George W Bush, insh'Allah" on his Cadillac. Thank you for your concern, though.

Review #8 on r/scotch 

**BUNNAHABHAIN 12**
**ABV:** 46.3%
**Bottle Opened:** 2 weeks
**Source:** Purchased locally for 62 USD

**Tasting methodology:**
I pour 2oz neat into a Glencairn at room temperature and promptly shove my nose in the glass for a first impression. After a moment I take my first sip, again, just looking for first impressions.

I then let the glass sit for 10 minutes or so and come back for a more thoughtful examination. I will sometimes add a bit of filtered water after several sips neat. If so, this is noted in the review.

**Color:**
[1.2 chestnut oloroso sherry.](http://malt-review.com/2015/09/10/whisky-flavour-wheels-and-colour-charts/) Perfectly clear with no sediment.

**First Impression:**
Nose is sherry and dark caramel. A bit more heat than the proof might suggest. First sip is sweet malt with typical sherry notes. Ripe cherries, a vat of red grapes stomped into juice, the faintest whiff of smoky peat. Mouthfeel is silky and rich. Finish brings a touch of baking spice, vanilla, oak barrel notes.

**After 10 minutes:**
Still a lot of sherry on the nose, but now also smelling roasted nuts, baking spices, over-ripe plums. Palate is quite complex. Malted grain sweetness, warm buttered toast, faint peat, a touch of burnt caramel, all under a bowl of smashed grapes, cherries, plums, and currants left out in the sun. Perfect mouthfeel. It coats without being sticky or cloying.

**Finish:**
Finish is straightforward with lingering sweetness and sherry. There is a touch of red-wine, tannic dryness, pepper, and a hint of salty sea-air.

**Overall:**
This is my first whisky from Bunnahabhain, and I'm very glad I picked it up. A much more nuanced Islay than the powerhouses from the likes of Ardbeg or Laphroaig. Looking forward to letting this one sit for s bit to see what some open time does for it. Solid, and very enjoyable.

**Scoring:**
- First Impression: 82/100
- Nose: 87/100
- Palate: 85/100
- Finish: 82/100

**Final Score: 84/100**

**Scoring Interpretation:**
- **0-59:** What is this? Yuck! Is this a joke?! Did I lose a bet?!

- **60-69:** Meh... glad I tried it so I have the palate experience, but I'm not gonna chase this down again.

- **70-79:** Nothing to get overwrought about, but if the price is right, I'd drink this any time.

- **80-89:** Fantastic! I want a bottle on my bar all the time.

- **90-94:** Truly amazing. A special treat I will savor when I can.

- **95-100:** Have yet to taste something I'd rate here. Ever optimistic I guess.

Thanks for reading. Again, I welcome any feedback you might have. Next up... more here on r/scotch.

~Cheers!

The cliff notes version of this announcement:

- Repopulation will be porting to Unreal Engine. Work began in Mid-November but never announced so as not to interfere with any chance Idea Fabrik might have of turning around the Hero Engine situation.
- Although this port will result in a long downtime while the new game gets ready for testing, a spin off title (which is a downsized survival version of Repop) titled Fragmented will be given away for free to all Repopulation owners (and also available to others). This is will enter testing in February. 
- Fragmented is the initial code base for UE4 Repopulation. Repopulation is still coming out.

That sucks. I've noticed a difference in attacking someone actually marked as rogue and someone who has a Red lifebar, but not marked as rogue. I guess that's so you can see where your last source of damage comes from in case they do intend to actually open fire. That one blurry line aside, I love the Dark Zone.

Speaking of hubs and people finding specific locations - I haven't played in ages, so I'm just wondering - is there now a way to track your path and set targets in NMS now? One of the things I found really disappointing was not being able to find systems I had previously visited. I wanted to see a full list of all the systems I had been to, and be able to set a path towards them if I wanted to revisit. 

Can you do this yet?
Damn...a chapter full of unexpected backstory, sick battle scenes, and a shit ton of buildup and suspense. Definitely interesting to learn more about Roma. Her age was definitely a shock but that goes to show the power of RC cells. I'm hoping that's a bit of foreshadowing on Ishida's part to hint that Kaneki can and will gain some of his longevity back. I'm also praying that Yomo, Naki and Miza fuck Mitsuki and Aura up considering I can't stand either of them lol. Lastly, Touka and the others better find a way out...if only Kaneki and his group or even Ayato were around :/

Adam Heine wrote a [great summary](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/torment-tides-of-numenera/posts/653368) on the Tides. You might try checking that out if you need details on the Tide system. 

As for how it all works, the game is built around the idea that you should choose the responses that come most naturally to the character you're roleplaying, and you'll see the world reacting to the type of person you've been up until that point. 

In other words, studying the Tides might help you identify what type of responses are aligned with a certain Tide, but they're definitely not required to just jump on into the game and start messing with the poor people of Sagus Cliffs.
Ah I haven't got it from Andy yet, I think I would have to sell it cause I spent too much money on the "endgame" build ;___;
I'd consider the the n-Suns variant of 5/3/1. [Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/) It has more frequent increases depending on how well you do.

Edit: Also, unless you're in a rush to compete in Powerlifting or something I really wouldn't sweat the speed at which you add weight -- it's not the only way to get stronger. Even in vanilla 5/3/1 your third set is AMRAP. Hitting 10+ reps with 95% of your training max is fucking brutal. Like, I'm-going-to-puke brutal. Keeping the weights submaximal also lets you get more reps with better form, and leaves you less likely to get injured when you push yourself.
I'm thinking of getting this or a reuleaux 2/3. I've got a TFV4 on some shitty kangertek mod atm and I can't deal with it anymore.
Ghouls and vampires are people infected with HMHVV (SR5 Core has basic stats in the "Critters" section). Werewolves, depending on the flavor you wanted, could either be another kind of HMHVV (Loup-Garou) victim or a wolf shapeshifter (both are in Run Faster). Basilisks are awakened lizards, and can be found in the Critters section of SR5 Core. Griffons and sirens either do not exist or are not statted up in Shadowrun 5th Edition that I know of. 

Shadowrun doesn't put as big of a focus on "monsters" as other RPGs. Most of what you are going to be fighting (or, at least, what the authors intended you be fighting) is gangers, corporate security, that sort of thing. That't not to say that this kind of a campaign is impossible, just that the rules don't focus on critters. Any decker or technomancer is going to feel nigh useless, and mages might prove even more powerful, as all critters are dual-natured (meaning they exist both in meat and astral space). Again, this isn't to dissuade you from this type of a campaign, just to warn you.
Would you be Interested in just buying the game? I made some foamcore inserts (not my best work) I can send you pics tomorrow?
Having straight bars allows the trigger to be mounted closer to the grip, making it possible to brake and honk. But yes even if you do that you lose dexterity of the brake you mount the trigger near.

You can jump into either and that goes for all the rebirth titles since the point of rebirth is so people can jump in and this is all covered right in the [Rebirth FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/511vju/rebirth_faq_20_electrical_reboogaloo/) that is found on the sidebar. The first issues are there to tell what has happened by giving a quick recap of what has happened. a Far as what is worth it; you can always check out the suggested/recommended reading(links at top and side of the page) or the latest of the [Rebirth surveys](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/6jbe43/dc_rebirth_survey_results_and_an_apology/) done on this sub.
That sounds good, not sure about freezing them though.
favorite part of tonight was the amount of people who've been going on about how good Bliss is that didnt even know what her fucking finisher is.
That seems like a lot of money for a dishwasher. After having an expensive Samsung be troublesome. I bought a cheapie Maytag, that I found on sale for $350. It's been perfect for 5 years now. I regard it as disposable, so I would not pay to fix it if it broke. But its been flawless so far.
Absolutely what you just said. I'm running an aggro chaos deck right now at arena level 5 with about a 95% win rate (as of my last update to the deck) and I very much rely on my blue dragon a lot of the time. But, if there's one kind of deck that I always lose to, it's a disrupt deck filled with the wolf spiders and any other creature that entangles, has opportunity, etc. 

If I were you, op, I'd try beefing up a couple of wolf spiders as high as they can go and put them in and just see if that helps at all.

Absolutely, I do. I don't talk to my ex, so I don't know how he feels. 

It's partially fear of being rejected and partially a belief of "if it didn't work then, it wouldn't work now" that keeps me from reaching out. 

We were young and we were both changing, I think. And I felt like I couldn't be who I wanted when we were together but now I wonder if he would have accepted me as I changed.
That shit broke my heart. I didn't expect that coming from a game like Borderlands, in all honesty.

The players were walking across a pit through a very narrow bridge with spikes at the bottom. Before making any checks one of the players asks the DM 
&gt; How much damage does the spike deals if we fall?

&gt; They kill you.

&gt; Yeah, but how much damage?

&gt; It kills you instantly. 

The player thinks for a while and then decides to tie a rope to the bridge and go down to snatch one of the spikes. 

&gt; I always wanted an insta-kill weapon.
I did all that, but the errors still come up. :(

I still think we can do some things that would bring in more money to provide for services that stop our current issues. If we could reform our prison system and legalize marijuana, we might be able help out most public universities give out free tuition. None the less, there needs to be an incentive for people to go far and some argue this isn't a good idea.

At the same time. People feel that increasing taxes aren't good because our government can be untrustworthy. It's a huge issue were facing here where nobody can decide what's good.

I feel that it doesn't represent what the whole of us believe. It's one of those movements that say "You're either with us or racist". Are there African-Americans who are wrongfully gunned down every year by police? Yes, as well as Hispanics, Asians and whites. Are there good cops who just made a wrong split second decision in a line of work that can be very stressful? Sure, but there are also bad cops. My views were swayed whenever a African-American got shot doing something straight up illegal. Like stealing from a store. Yet, we also had a case were a boy got killed for having an airsoft rifle. I'm torn between African-Americans making every death a martyr without looking at the facts were as white people complain about/denying the problem. It's an issue. (To anyone who knows. When are teasers suppose to be used instead of fire arms in the police force?)

It really depends on what your goals are. It would be super hard for you to be able to craft every meta deck there is, but if you just want to grind to legend with a cheap aggro deck that is 100% doable. 

I would guess it'd take you about a year of play to get "caught up," but once again, that just depends on what your personal definition of "caught up" is.

Well, Ebola was actually a warning about how vulnerable an "under-resourced area" is when faced with a technological challenge. "Mother Africa" is, no matter how vociferously it proclaims ascendance and parity,  ill equipped intellectually and infrastructure wise to handle a crisis. Not just tribal killings in the millions. The west assumes Africa, like Europe, will work out its problems one way or another. A real challenge at a species level will undoubtedly arise in "the cradle of civilization". Like so many times before we will then see why our mist born grandparents fled the failure of imagination of Africa that pretends outside forces rather than a fatal flaw, an inclusion in the soul if you will, has been holding back this "force for the ages". 

Death is currently stalking Africa with a smile.

I don't think there is any real lore identifying which twin is what, as far a loyalty.

They did appear to disagree about things, but more about if they should have followed the cabal or stood loyal.

Most fans favor Omegon as the more likely to be a loyalist, but Praetorian of Dorn sort of suggested Alpharius may have been trying to defect back to the Imperium..

But the twin primarch's are so interchangeable, it's sometimes hard to tell which one is who.

&gt; is it not renouncing the religion?

Exactly. That said, I probably don't support ISIS at all.

&gt; i think their interpretation can be defended

OK, so as an apologist for ISIS, how do you defend:

- ignoring Muhammed's use of a sword when there is very clear evidence within the hadiths that he used a sword for executions?

- burning people to death when there is overwhelming evidence in the hadiths that Muhammed was opposed to this punishment? Most ISIS apologists justify this by way of the one or two hadiths in which he seemed to have agreed with burning, but fail to explain how they reconcile this with the majority of hadith that condemn burning.

- not collecting the *jizya* when it is one of the first commandments within Islam. There is, to my knowledge, only one "suspected" case of ISIS having collected the jizya, but I question the authenticity of that report.

Let the apologetics commence.
I'm sure this isn't the only reason I should be put behind bars 🙃

Hi, reddit.
tl:dr - This was a federal court case not a tax court of canada case, so it was about the procedures CRA was following.  Taxpayer said taxpayer relief should apply to late notices of objection.  CRA said no taxpayer relief doesn't apply.  Judge said that yes taxpayer relief can apply to late notices of objection.  The matter was sent back to CRA to be reconsidered.

I expect CRA will just consider the matter like they usually do.  "Our records show the notice of assessment was mailed to your address on this date.   Your objection was past 90 days.  Request denied."

While this does open up another angle of attack for late notices of objection, I don't see it as much of a game changer.

Why not? Mark lost both of his parents. Who's to say he doesn't suffer from PTSD or C-PTSD. Jessica has experienced trauma with the loss of her dad. PTSD is just not for soldiers of war. 

1. It is important to remember that not everyone who lives through a dangerous event develops PTSD. PTSD also does not always equal aggression. Many people with it have avoidance symptoms, flashbacks, trouble sleeping, reactivity emotions and/or somatic reactions.  

2. You know one great way to treat PTSD? Talk therapy. Being able to talk through his anxieties, fears and rationale with Jessica have seemed to really benefit Cody. We see him reflecting a lot, showing emotions and learning to be vulnerable the longer he stays in that house. 

3. We don't even know if he has PTSD, but he if he does, going on the show mightily greatly impact his life. He said he was miserable with his life before coming on the show. Perhaps this show will lead to a breakthrough for him, open doors and really allow for him to reflect on his life. People with PTSD deserve grace and hope. 

Finally - Josh doesn't have PTSD that we know of, but he's displayed moments where he has major emotional triggers. So why should someone like Cody not be given an equal chance like Josh? Or even Mark? I'm genuinely curious.

""They X-rayed her luggage and they found 5.8kg of cocaine concealed in packaging which was meant to be gifts for people for her bridal party and family friends," Khala told The Adelaide Advertiser."

Sounds like porky pies to me. Giving wedding guests and friends the same gifts, and headphones at that ... how weird is that? And if she really didn't know the contents included drugs, what was going to happen when she arrived in Australia? The bag was to be stolen from her? Or her friends end up with drug-packed headphones as gifts? To what ends? 

If there was 6kg of drugs in the headphones there must have been a bucket-load of headphones. Twenty would be 300g of cocaine per headphone, so too heavy to not notice, and probably not enough room in the headphones to fit 300g in anyway. Forty headphones might be able to take 6kg total (150g each), but who would buy 40 headphones as wedding gifts?

No, this sounds like a make-believe story from a desperate family to me.
your best source will be to google the model number of the laptop with the phrase "linux". You'll see if people have any issues with getting the hardware to work. If you can get access to a floor model, you could try putting a copy of Ubuntu onto a USB stick and try booting it on that laptop. Then see how well the hardware works. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows

Audio and video hardware don't vary all that much anymore, so you should be fine there, but you may encounter issues with wifi adapters and the basic chipset in the machine, which may prevent bootup. Also, Linux doesn't always have the greatest support for power management on laptops, but it has been improving over the past couple of years

Very interesting, my friend. 

There is a lot to consider here. But dying and ''coming back'' to life has always been a major theme in the MGS saga for one. Dead soldiers being brought back from the darkness. Gray Fox, Big Boss etc. ''Neither enemy, nor friend. I am back from a world, where such words are meaningless''

The paralels to Silent Hills have always fascinated me and which is why I always liked theories pointing to MGSV being in Jacks head. Like many, one of the first theories I had was the coma dream theory. 

Silent Hill 2 which you mentioned, which was James Sunderlands personal tailored-made hell.. constantly reminding him of the pain, guilt and angst he had because of what he had done. Similarly I've thought MGSV could then maybe be viewed as Jacks personal hell, or purgatory for a better analogy. And what would that look like really, what form would it take? Maybe stuck in an endless state of nuclear-fueled conflict, killing the same faceless man over and over again. Old and long dead enemies and dead friends appearing, the taking of child soldiers including the appearence of Liquid who later also dies because of his actions.. the Shining Lights mission does read like an intense nightmare. The guilt of having gotten all of your own men killed, which is what allegedly happened at Ground Zeroes. And if he was in a coma dream right after having experienced that along with his history.. well. If you view MGSV as Jacks guilt-ridden nightmare the plot of MGSV makes a lot of sense to me.

I'm not saying that this is what happened, but it's an interesting thought for sure. Good job putting this together OP, I love reading stuff like this.

I just had a rather heated discussion with two older Clinton supporters that I've known for years and their entire argument was to condescend me and my friend as young, naive and idealistic. Bernie's healthcare plan was "pie in the sky" and could never happen (just like Hillary said). 

It's amazing to see two people that I had previously seen as idealistic liberals buy into Hillary's pessimistic "pragmatism" of refusing to aspire to anything just because she says so.
If you look at it strictly in terms of numbers and probabilities, it seems very unlikely.

Ours is only one of ~100 billion stars in our galaxy, which has been around for ~13.2 billion years. That seems like plenty of time for other intelligent beings to evolve and gain spaceflight capability.

But, the earth has only been around for ~4.5 billion years, Homosapians have only been around for 200,000, and recorded history only goes back (dramatic pause) 5,000 years!

It's been about 100 years since Marconi, so if the aliens visited after detecting our earliest radio broadcasts, they must have been within a sphere with a ~50 light-years radius*, a volume of space that contains only 133 stars! Intelligent life may not be unique to Earth, but it's probably much less than 2-in-133.

What if they didn't come because of our radio signals? Maybe they were just exploring? OK, but now you have to look at how many stars there are in our galaxy, and the tiny little blip of time that Humans have been living on the Earth, and recording history. The aliens would have to have fantastic luck to have visited us in just the narrow span of time that we were around.

(*) Our radio signals have traveled 100 light years, but any aliens more than 50 light years away wouldn't have arrived here yet, even traveling at near light speed.

Ooh, I am going to have to look into the Mooncursed Barbarian! That looks very good! Thank you.
I did not say employers always have more leverage, I said they tend to. I looked up the McDonalds you are talking about and the reason the owner pays more is because there is a lot of jobs in the community because of the oil boom. In many parts of the country, there is no oil boom to drive up the wages. The example you are giving is anecdotal. 

The 3.9% you are throwing around is based on the federal minimum wage, if you take into account the amount of people making minimum wage (according to the local wage) then the number would go up. Places like LA and New York are super expensive to live in. 

And the arbitrary number made up by the government your talking about, right after the minimum wage is increased, the economy tends to improve, so the government increasing the minimum wage is better for the economy compared to the free market negotiations you are talking about. The link below basically says that a government mandated minimum wage increase lead to unemployment falling by 17%.

And you third point, did you even look at the link I had, Luxxotica owns Sears Optical and Target Optical. The other brand names you named sell Ray-bans and other brans which are owned by Luxxotica.

And for the forth point, GDP is not a accurate measure of how the economy is doing, even the person who came up with the concept said that. And the unemployment figure is also not a good way to get a pulse on the economy since people who want full time employment but work part time because of the lack of opportunities will be counted as employed. I do have to admit that I may have underestimated the amount of sales taken over by online retailers and I was completely unaware of the over saturation of malls. Maybe it's time to turn them into parks or something.
Its the concentration you have to look for.  The more expensive brand names may take a few drops to sud up your dishes meanwhile the watered down generic for cheaper takes a huge dose for the same result.
Looks like the fucking goblin king from the hobbit.
Yay!
Servers will get paid minimum if their tips and normal wage does not meet what they would have earned making minimum for the time period. Tips just allow them to make more then minimum.

its wrong

canada post can open your non lettermail packages any time they want without a warrant i used to think otherwise but they can and they have people whos jobs it is to do so, random mail carriers will not be doing it that being said their job is to deliver packages and with them barely making a profit and being understaffed and overworked checking random packages falls pretty low on their priority. They absolutely can check any non letter/envelope mail at anytime during transit however to ensure there are no "undeliverable goods" inside.

law enforcement needs a warrant however
i literally fucking said it was optional...
Kid ate glass used to bring it to school in his bag and crunch it up and swallow. i saw him a few years ago gave him a wide berth

Wow. I love this community. I already have 10 submissions in 30 minutes. Please keep them coming, and I'll do a report early this week as a January wrap up. Kind of like a dry run. 

Please share feedback below on questions you think I might have missed, other data you would like to see compiled, etc.
Screw you this is awesome.
The same people who are scared of their own shadow
Same music. Same outfit. Same heel reaction.
I think you may be going into tin-foil hat territory with the notion of paid censorship and shilling...

Personally, I'd consider myself a Nintendo fan - I own 5 of their systems and numerous games across all of them.  I almost created a thread complaining about just this thing a full day ago, but figured I'd wait a couple days before I passed judgement, in hopes it might stabilize or improve.  

I have no qualms about criticizing the company.  It's pointless to rant and whine.  However, there's no reason someone who supports them cannot want them to improve and express valid criticisms because they'd like to see their investment in a new platform yield some enjoyment. 

I think there's many folks similar to me here, in addition to the apologist-types.
I hope so!!
pls Braun. 

But something tells me it is gonna be a fuck finish
In all seriousness though, this could be a struggling small business owners daily deposit, which could mean the difference between paying rent/utilities on time or missing a payment. Op is a kind person.
Welcome to Weekend League.
Maybe I worded it wrong, but there was a Day 1 update, that must be the solution based on the other comments. It's just odd. But I just thought and maybe I know what this is.
100%

I'm surprised by the lack of faith tbh when you only need to look at that poll to see that Leo ranked higher than his older brother. I'm prepared to eat my words if it goes sour lol but at the same time, I feel like his victory wouldn't be dark horse underdog either if we go by the polls results.
You may want to try setting it to open then. That seems like the most likely culprit.
Video package of Braun smashing keyboards at Wreddit user homes with an ambulance.
I think he looks way better without the pube beard.
Awesome bro, keep it up.
Dat save percentage tho.....http://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/pitching/sort/savePct/type/expanded/order/false
Holy shit, why downvote?
He's not driving when he does this
It's going well.  I'm sore from snowboarding yesterday so I have not done a thing today.  :/

I love Grease!  Such a great movie.
*Coast Guard* LUL
why would they though if it guarantees an invite to TI7? even 13th-16th place walked away with over $90k. 
If they really are disbanding, then I think they'll wait for announcements of invites to see if they are or not.
They even added sound affects, this is the MotY already
Have you heard the way they pronounce Carnegie? They say it Car-NEY-gee. A friend and I looked it up, turns out the person who's name is on the music hall in NY and Carnegie-Mellon University said his own name the Pennsylvania way.
[Scaramuccia (literally "little skirmisher"), also known as Scaramouche or Scaramouch, is a stock clown character of the Italian commedia dell'arte (comic theatrical arts). The role combined characteristics of the zanni (servant) and the Capitano (masked henchman). Usually attired in black Spanish dress and burlesquing a don, he was often beaten by Harlequin for his boasting and cowardice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaramouche)
Eat, sleep and shit.
So are you saying that if two people are dating/married when a women gives birth, they should then be forced to stay in a relationship for years and years until that baby can take care of itself? Regardless of the health of the relationship of the parents they should stay together for the child? A child can be better off raised by a happy single parents than a miserable pair of two parents.
Yes, because Burgoyne essentially did the same tackle but because only one arm was pinned, didn't get two weeks, even though the one arm that was free couldn't do anything to prevent Reid's concussion. The clause says (e.g. arms pinned). It's that s that makes the difference, and it's pretty fucking retarded, but there's no way to challenge it.
This is so funny. The mental image of him, at work where people can see him, sticking his hand in his pants to scratch his butt is making me crack up.
"Make sure everyone has a shit job and is unhappy" isn't "solving" unemployment, it's still awful.

GDP growth doesn't equal well-being growth.

Choice is exactly what I want, people need to have that option to not work for it to be a choice.
&gt;King of the Hill. (GREAT TV show).

FTFY.
Also support Zionism and the persecution of Palestinians, great company!
Someone on here did say Matt was gonna be broken by a brogue kick Big if true.
Dude its obvious here. And that's ok. what is not okay is letting it fucking continue. Fisher needs to do something here. Wonder why there is no bogut/speights/ or other big? cause kp would dominate them. Kerr knows this.
Gubble maybe?
Just mix in some cocaine.
I can't read this past all of the acid rain we don't have any more because the free market was taking too long to change.
Been listening to SYSK, Stuff To Blow Your Mind and TechStuff for almost six years now. I remember the old days when STBYM was Stuff From The Science Lab with Robert Lamb and Allison Loudermilk.
Chris chan is better
So the upcoming Deadpool is also part of the new timeline, right? I assumed it would be, but haven't actually seen anything official about it.
I think the point of the gif was the monkeys gesture, not it actually being a monkey.
I hope all he takes is 30 minutes to settle in. It's more about building that working relation with our wingers and Özil. That's about it.
How would Bregman take second away from Altuve?

Everyday, before getting in my car, I take a deep breath and be present in the moment, and tell myself it's going to be a good day, because I'm alive and I have a job. Anything that happens that is unpleasant will be over soon, and anything outside my control is not worth stressing over.
Also, Not living for the weekend. I saw a comedian that said something about all those drones that always say "only couple more days till Friday!" or "it's almost Friday", then you realize that mentality is spending 5/7ths of your life waiting for the other 2/7ths.
There was also [Dragon Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Crystal) and [Fatal Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Labyrinth) released in 1990. Some people would call those roguelikes, while others would call them roguelites (though I personally see them as roguelikes due in part to their turn-based play).
I prefer a standard pad so my left hand has a couple of buttons to hit as well (L1/L2). Seems inefficient to opt for a controller scheme where one hand has to choose between 8 buttons to hit or some combination of them.
T'sais - J'ai eu ma part de chicanes de beaux-frères aux fêtes avec des discussions politiques qui ont dérapé, mais un des arguments que je fais tout le temps (et qui passe) quand j'évalue un chef de parti en me demandant s'il ferait un bon PM est le suivant: sait-il s'entourer de personnes compétentes **et écouter leurs conseils**?

Mon verdict pour l'instant (Les choses peuvent changer):

Il est impossible que PKP n'ait pas les moyens de se doter des meilleurs conseillers que le fric puisse acheter. Mais il n'a pas encore démontré qu'il a l'humilité et la sagesse d'utiliser leurs conseils.

En ce qui me concerne, c'est une faiblesse mortelle. La première décision que doit prendre un nouveau PM, et la plus importante de son mandat, c'est de nommer son conseil des ministres. Je ne vois pas (jusqu'à présent) PKP mettre la meilleure personne à la bonne place **et mettre son ego de côté** pour accepter leurs décisions dans leurs ministères après qu'ils aient étudié les dossiers avec les meilleurs infos disponibles si elle lui semblent contre intuitives. Il ne sait pas déléguer. Faiblesse mortelle pour un PM.

Pour notre bien à tous, il est essentiel que s'il est jamais élu PM, il ait d'abord aquis cette humilité, appris à écouter ses conseillers, et appris à déléguer.
The sun is damaging your DNA the second you go outside. What matters is the quantity of damage. That's why we have a UV index that predicts the strength of the sun and tells us how much sun screen to wear and when to put it on.
I assume brand name recognition has a lot to do with it or maybe a contract with the government? Idk I just know that they are the only company the schools in this part of California use.
Missy was definitely fun. Shame about the laser screwdriver.
I dunno man! I pressed enter and it was a new line in the box; suffice to say I'm still pretty new to this! And the beauty of the kpj format is that whichever way I format is that. So in this instance it means failing to start a new line, capitalizing occasionally, and omitting use of periods, commas, and semi colons.
Oh
You just blew my mind. I though I was the only one that thought this. Doesn't look like we're right though, but this is still what I think.
you forgot: 

* harvey (2015): "hey guys i wanna be careful with my arm since it just fell off last year."
* fans: dis guy is da biggest jerk of all time!! we pay him $600 thousand dollahs!! he'll pitch when we tell him to pitch!!! what a lose-ah! you dont see thor whinin ovah the-ah! now he's ouwa ace."
IIRC it was in Austria, there was a culture clash of a slavic group getting prioritized by government welfare (something similar to that) programs and social programs and the more productive germans being criticized.

That being said, the Asiatic hordes idea comes from the assumption of Russia (quickly growing in power/population) was not really white but mongols. It's hard to distinguish hatred of Russians from genuine fear of an invasion, because they called Russians "Untermensh" but they also called Churchill and Roosevelt "Untermensch". 

Plus from the German perspective, eastern Europe/Russia was less developed at the time and during wartime they acted far less civilized, which added to the perception. 

I don't thing his idea of Europe being over-run was the same thing as what we see now.
John Titor. Is he a conspiracy theory?
Sherman's gonna get so much shit from Lockett for that
Good for you, brother. Glad to hear it.
In China, it's impolite if you don't fart loudly after a big meal.
So because i dont have your perspective, i need perspective?

Perspective, bro - understand it.
Hey mate thanks for that i guess i havent had a coldsore in over 18 months. Made me feel better.
Why are rooms dark when the lights are off?
I'm actually a *pretty* big SS/Eric fanboy. That's the thing.

Super bummed.

Ah.  
  
Never even crossed my mind, but now that I think about it... I think he would look kind of silly with, like, a crew cut or a comb-ver... or bald, even.
The event will be at the Whittemore Center at UNH. I'm not sure how to get a ticket yet but I'm sure they'll be available online soon.

It is on the 4th, not sure why CNN mentioned it being on the 3rd probably just a minor mistake. The event will be aired on MSNBC
Same. I consider myself rather nerdy so it's weird I haven't seen them. I just hadn't got around to it and now it's sort of a personal feat.

I doubt the plat player is playing to rank himself up in this situation, it's more about him bringing up the bronze player.

Where are you getting this?  If you deploy in the Reserves and you want to keep your place, pay with your BAH.  If you don't want to keep your place, take in a copy of your orders and tell them you're breaking your lease.  If they give you grief, make an appointment at JAG and they'll send a strongly worded letter...and will break your lease.  Pack up your stuff, put it in storage, pay the storage fees.
Is he black?
What the hell? You might be right but hating on Andy is the cool thing now. :)
As in made me laugh till I cried?
will do.

Jessica: Do you think I'm gonna feel safe being on the block and then *owe* you something? ...So everyone wanted me to go home and I'm supposed to be thankful? Thank you for "saving" me.
Yeah, I tried installing CloudyG3 as I had the zip on my memory card, but it gave a security error.
no problem, let me know what you think!
Eat sushi, live better subway.
&gt;This has happened a couple times in history. The first one I can think of is All for Love by John Dryden which is an imitation of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra.

That's pretty hilarious that that's the *first* thing you can think of, when Shakespeare's play *is already* an imitation of an earlier story.
So the level 15 perk already kicked in? Gun levels are so broken lmao

Test both guns and see if the left one reloads faster.
Gun placement is important for maximizing your DPS (Damage Per Second). Guns cannot shoot through other guns on your bot, and you can't shoot through your own cubes. If your guns are being blocked, you'll see white sparks coming off the object they are being blocked by. 

Use test mode to figure out good gun placement to prevent shots from getting blocked from each other. Sometimes when playing my alt-account's bots on lower ranks I'll see a flat gunbed with most of it's back guns being blocked by forward guns, etc.
Well I ordered size XL and it fit me, little snug but it fits, they might have changed it a bit since I ordered them but I still rock mine for **¥45**.
I'm not even into dudes, and he looks damn good.
every mall unit puts a sign out in front of their dropped gates on Sunday apologizing for those who wanted a sandwich, but saying they're closed so that employees can have a day with their families.
~900 for a nice two bedroom place. 15 minute subway commute away from UTSG.
A period drama about Hernan Cortez' conquest of Mexico.
Sure thing. 

*He makes her a Shirley Temple, complete with grenadine and cherry on top. He hands the fizzy drink to her.* 

Much better than water. Even with an umbrella.
...and also there's Ryback

I grew up about 45 minutes from Pittsburgh. I bloody *hate* "yinz". Never say it. I do, unfortunately, sometimes do the Pittsburgh/Pixburgh fuck up if I'm talking too fast.
Me too! I try to do all this collecting stuff, putting certain things in 'proper' places, etc. and my stupid settlers steal and knock my stuff around. One thing I did do for "my" house, is that I took out anything they could sit on. It helped. Maybe Fallout 5 will have a way to lock doors, esp for your own house.

Riding in a taxi in Italy. Holey moley, I thought I was going to die. The roads were packed, cars were going every which way, and the taxi just went on faith, I presume. I just had to close my eyes and hope.
Thanks!!!! So validating to hear this, I also joined a porn addict forum and honestly while I definitely am not proud of porn, in prior relationships it added to the fun!

I've examined this in therapy and I definitely harmed myself and my relationship. I used porn as a way to escape my problems, to numb the pain of rejection...maladaptive coping strategy.

She just wants to be the victim. I own that I hurt her feelings and she feels betrayed. So I'll make it up to her by being a good dad and co-parent for our kids and the best friend I can be to her while still taking care of myself.

You rock thanks for making my night less depressing!
It's a skill. Did I mention the oculus?

Trump praised Comey repeatedly throughout the campaign though? Complaints of Comey from dems and republicans came at different times and he wasn't universally hated by both at any point either?

If Trump wanted to handle things professionally, why did he drag Sessions through the mud on twitter instead of covertly doing it like suggested with Scaramucci/Preibus/Spicer?

* Big JRPG, following the hero Dart (heh) and he and his friends strive to...do something, I forget. But they get Saiban hero transformations and all the attacks are "[hit-the-button-at-the-right-moment](https://youtu.be/B3AJW1pLz70?t=1m38s)" combo sequences, and I remember Woolie saying he liked those sorts of attacks.

After donating blood, the Red Cross sent me a letter informing me that my blood may have made someone sick, so I should probably come in for testing for a chronic illness. Felt like I had every symptom for the two weeks before I could schedule that...
You can turn chat to teammates only if toxicity of opposing players bothers you. 

You can also play solo standard if you're tired of playing dudes that are much more coordinated because they are friends IRL and are using mics to communicate their shots &amp; passing. Wish Psyonix would bring in a solo doubles for this reason.

You should learn to enjoy the opportunity of facing higher skilled players - they will force you to improve your game and get better. If you play equally ranked players all of the time you're likely to plateau on your game much quicker.

Lastly, the game became a lot more fun &amp; satisfying when I stopped obsessing over my rank. Fact of the matter is I can school some plats even tho Im a gold player and I get schooled by silver players from time to time so what does rank even really mean? Nothing imo. And the shit you get from whatever rank you end up at the end of the season is garbage imo and I never equip any of it.

Moral of the story: just play the game, give it your best &amp; if ur on a losing streak then stop playing and play a diff game. Good luck, mate.
Realistically you have 0% chance with a 2.1
Don't worry about readability, mine was a mess. 
1- Was that sarcasm? We've been over this, democracy and fascism are mutually exclusive. The UK has a functioning representative democracy. Honestly, it tends to misrepresent its population because of the way their voting system works but it's still effective. And just because it has a Queen and a House of Lords doesn't make it any less democratic, their roles are almost purely ceremonial. 
 
6-The media is not bought and paid for, otherwise why does fox spend so much time criticizing the most powerful man in the country? And what about foreign news?  Do the Koch brothers own the British government and dictate what the BBC can and can't report on? Or Al Jazeera?

9-Lobbying and making laws are different things. True, companies spend fortunes on lobbying groups, but that doesn't mean that they'll always be successful. Look at net neutrality, some of the most powerful lobbies are telecommunications groups like comcast and time warner, the current head of the FCC used to be a comcast lobbyist, but net neutrality still won out. They may be able to get laws to favor them, but to say they make the laws simply isn't true. 

12-I agree that one of the biggest problems with the U.S. now is the prison system, and it needs to change. But I have confidence that just like so many other problems of the past like

-big monopolies (Teddy Roosevelt and his trust busting) 

-poor sanitation in meat factories (The Jungle) 

-and hell, even segregation can be fixed by internal reform.  

14-I agree that Citizens United vs FEC ruling was bull, and that super pacs are bad for democracy, but democracy still happens. People vote, not corporations. And Politicians can't actually spend any of the super pac money themselves, it all has to be spent for them, so there's still a layer of disconnect. 

There are things wrong with the country and the government, but they're fixable and they certainly aren't indicative of a new fascist regime. Two hundred years of history are a testament to that.
Wha? How do they govern that?

As far as the spear itself goes I might try upping the opacity of the glass, right now it's a bit hard to see it. Also even with that glass component for me it's still feeling a bit 2D, I'd try having a few areas where more solidified areas pop out one voxel (that white ring comes to mind).

Removing the flair on this one for now but feel free to toggle/switch them with eachother.

This sounds great as I generally average 8 hours/day in the poker room
So there is this koala bear and he's in Vegas for a business trip. He's looking for a good time, so he hits the strip and finds himself a hooker. He takes the hooker back to his hotel room, and as soon as they walk in the door, they start going at it. Soon enough, the koala bear is eating her out, and then shortly after, he finishes on her. The koala bear gets his things and starts walking towards the door. The hooker says to him, "hey you haven't paid me yet." So the koala bear says, "well I'm a koala bear and I don't have to pay." So the hooker says, "why not?" The koala bear says, "you got a dictionary? Look it up." So the stripper opens the dictionary and sure enough, right under koala bear it says, 'eats shoots and leaves.'
I guess you're right. And maybe some of what I feel for her is provoked by knowing she sees me like a mature person she can count on. And she mimics my attitudes. She started smoking after I taught her how to (not proud of that), she became a member of the political party I'm a member of... 

I know my ego is a part of of this issue too, I'll probably have to resolve my feelings about this too. 

Anyways, thanks for the talk, you've helped me put some things in perspective, using a throwaway gives me liberty to say what I'm thinking without fear of judgement. I'm afraid of saying stupid things while talking to my friends (even though I know my best friend wouldn't judge me. I've got some issues, I know).

I did bring it up with her last night and I told her it upset me but I'm not 100% sure if she really realizes how painful hearing that from someone you absolutely love and want to marry in the next two years. 

Like if the shoe is on the other foot I can almost say with certainty that any other woman would be crying on the phone and asking me if I truly loved them if I said I would be making out with X if I wasn't in this relationship.
&gt; Nope, not at all, you have the right to refer to your rapist as a rapist, likewise he can (and did) refute it. Victims of rape/child abuse, bullying, parental abuse, police brutality or whistle-blowers etc. shouldn't be silenced.

If there is no evidence for him raping her why should she be allowed to call him a rapist?

I thought this was common knowledge: if someone DCed from the game and someone pauses, everyone from the other team **must wait at least 30 seconds to unpause even if the DCed player isn't in the team of the guy that paused**.

Examples:

* If Dire player get DCed and Dire player pauses: only Dire players can unpause before waiting 30 seconds.

* If Dire player get DCed and Radiant player pauses: only Radiant players can unpause before waiting 30 seconds.

LOL what server xD? I'm the guild leader for #1 guild too.... I keep the 10 people getting shards on the same for 4 to 5 weeks until they all get 200 shards, and then rotate.

Saturday - Wednesday is for the high contribution (Wave 1) and Thursday - Friday is for low contribution (Wave 2). This way it ensures that everyone will EVENTUALLY get all the shards....

Which of course explains why the cost of state-run liquor stores is higher, with worse selection, and worse service than private liqor stores. 

Really makes you think.
Auctioneer is actually the defining card for Miracle Rogue. The whole idea of Miracle Rogue as a deck is to try to create very powerful swing turns. Using certain combinations of cards to answer the board or get ahead. In particular, Auctioneer is really good at this. Between Counterfeit Coin, Backstab, and Prep, you can find a lot of ways to chain several spells together and draw several cards. Miracle Rogue often does play from behind on board, it's just that these "miracle" turns are extremely powerful and can really turn a game on its head very quickly. Sherazin and Edwin both combo well with multiple cards in a turn, and Arcane Giants also benefit from your crazy Auctioneer turns. The game is often defined by a single turn switching you to a now "in the lead" position.

Tempo Rogue is more about getting on board early and using efficient cards to keep yourself ahead. Argent Squire is a pretty medium card, but it's very good at contesting early board control and for comboing. It's a different play style because it's more aggressive and less combo oriented. You just want to keep deploying minions that help you contest the board and stay ahead.

Miracle Rogue beats Hunter by fighting well for the board early. You want to draw cards like SI:7, Backstab, Swashburgler, Eviscerate, and Razorpetal Lasher. Even Fan of Knives and Edwin can be good in certain situations. You contest the board as best as you can early and then hope that by the mid game, you're drawing things like Auctioneer or Vilespine Slayer which really help put on the pressure and close out the game. Hunter is a class that generally has to be winning board early to put enough damage through. They have ways to close out the game with their hero power and spells like Kill Command, but those only work under the assumption they pushed enough damage.

I played Arma 2 for 400 hours in steam and about 900-1000 hours with -nosteam (when it's was easier to use mods with launchers) and I can't only write negative review about this game. It was bad and stagnated game even when Arma 3 wasn't announced and gone even worse after A3 launched. I played mostly realistik A.C.E mod in PvP.


Same with Red Orchestra 2, where I have 250 hours. Game just feel the same everytime: everybody hipshoting with Mg-34, even soviets had mg34 from start. It was fine game on level 10 with no unlocks, but when you 99 level veteran you have too good bonuses and suppression barely noticable if you "Hero" level.

Huh that's interesting, I have personally met Pierre-Yves Daoust and he said that there is nothing strikingly inhumane about the seal hunt and that it is at least on par with how domesticated animals are slaughtered. That's not verbatim but that's the gist of what he said. 

My gut response is to trust him as I have met him and he seems reputable but the paper by Dr. Mary Richardson does seem to make valid claims. I would need to spend some more time delving through Daoust's report to form my own opinion but you have at least forced me to be more skeptical of Daoust's claims.
One thing I rarely hear mentioned about waterside tables is how much people in boats will yell at you. Maybe it was just an off day for me, but when I ate waterside, I was being yelled at the whole time. People thought they were being awfully funny, but it did take away from the experience.

Bought it on Steam and Android. Love it. I also admire the devs dedication and passion; they inspired me to work on my games on GameMaker.  

It's probably comparable to Don't Starve with the crafting progression of Terraria. I don't like Don't Starve and Terraria is OK but I spent a lot of time with Crashlands because I like the visual design and gameplay.

Still working on leveling the team up, but for my first main team after picking the game up a couple weeks ago, I'm building up the following team:

Olivia - Sharena - Julia - Lachesis

Thinking of maybe replacing Lachesis with Sakura or potentially an archer/thief, though the last slot I am saving for a colorless.  I just like Lachesis or Sakura for the option of having both offense and healing in the slot.  Would you recommend I stick with Lachesis or Sakura, and if so, which one?  If not, who would you say I should go with?
Yes
Prince for me.

For the same reason we usually deny using them. PR. They aren't illegal, you can see the membership list of the treaty that bans them for yourself - none of the big boys signed it.

Russians are directly supporting the SAA, and if you look at the map you can see who the SAA is fighting and why. In the areas where they are engaging ISIS, Russians are bombing ISIS. By and large, the SAA is prioritizing other rebel groups right now - once again, why that is the case is clearly and obviously seen on any conflict map.

And if a third of all Russian airstrikes are against ISIS (surprised it's that high tbh), why in the world would you call Putin an ISIS supporter?

Eh my solution is to unbury my car, make just enough of a hole in my window that I can safely drive the 100 yards to a turn-about that is truck-plowed and in about 5 minutes clear my car, and not feel like an asshole dumping tons of snow someone else has to manually shovel it.

Sadly the only option we have is the patina, and even then we can only apply the texture to areas already defined within the patina paint kit per gun. The Glock for instance will only apply the texture to the upper section.

In the movie, he describes his real face as 'scarred' and attributed it to the Jedi's. He was using it to garner sympathy. No one thought that was his real face, they thought he was a victim of the Jedi oppression.

To be honest, I would guess this would be the opinion of most people seeing it for the first time now. I think nostalgia is playing a big factor for this movie.

Rocky is also, for me, the movie with the most Imdb votes that I haven't seen yet. I don't think sports movies are popular in general though, quite the contrary. The genre has very few classics.

Agree with you on all the BP winners except The King's Speech.

i didn't put in the 95% confidence interval because they seemed meaningless given my p-value. Here they are:

95% confidence interval: From -0.25477922765 to -0.15174251235

Given that my p-value is &gt;0.0001, I *want* to say that I am 100% confident, but then again, I did run 40+ runs at each dungeon. So unless Neople coded some weird ass variance into their RNG, this difference should be fairly accurate. Maybe not 9-Haldiom-to-1-Halidom difference, but still.

My theory is that testosterone does nothing to inhibit breast growth as there is no reason for T to have any effect on those tissues.  Put some extra E in your system however and things start getting activated.  I don't know if there's a proper term for it but they aren't competitive traits.  Also, adding E to your system will trigger [feedback mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis) to lower your body's production of T, so even without an AA you are most likely running at lower levels.

Not bad. Just subtle enough. This has been my running gag for years when we get someone in talking crap.

Point and case, we had a guy pitching us on some project they were working on. A little bit CRM, a little bit HR tool. So he's sitting there showing us these fields where I shit you not, there is php code and yaml which, I guess is stored in the db at some point. Called it flexible. Then went on showing us how you could arbitrarily add a property to a user because there was no strict schema (which I guess in some cases is a good thing but not in an HR tool clearly).

I had basically gone into professional courtesy mode and was smiling and nodding and then I heard it.

Man, I had no idea how many Christians obsess over masturbation before Reddit.  The church I grew up in never made a single peep about masturbation or even premarital sex (I'm Episcopalian); it wasn't even a thing that came up at church camp.  Adulthood taught me that there are a lot of sects which discourage masturbation but I honestly thought they were few.  Get on Reddit and BOOM! twenty fucking front page of /r/Christianity posts about how to avoid masturbating.

Name: James Smith

Nickname: Admiral

Class: Gunslinger

Physical Features: White American Male with long curly brown hair (muy privilege) and Aviators 

Armor: Dark Grey/Black w/ no headgear (OG XCOM armor if you can)

Attitude: By the Book

Bio: Smith joined the Resistance shortly after gaining a high-ranking position in the ADVENT Government. He'd done a good job with public relations, always convincing those around him that ADVENT were a force for good. With his new position and devout loyalty, the Aliens allowed Smith to travel aboard one their interstellar vessels for a short time beyond Earth, sure that he would return with more material to his stump speech about "the Aliens glory and the grand future of the Human Race". Contrary to this, he came back a different man. He had seen but a glance beyond the veil, but it was all he needed. Within a week of his return, he disappeared from his apartment in New Chicago and arrived on our doorstep, determined to help XCOM free humanity's hands to grasp the stars.

Plumbing in this game is very irritating. There needs to be a more "rubbery" pipe section that can conform to where it needs to go. I think it is silly that you have to place industrial cookers and water reservoirs on existing pipes. IMO you should be able to place either of those where you actually want them, then connect the plumbing.

Just adding in the spirit of potentially correcting my own ignorance.  Main thing I remember about it was that it helped keep the highlights in check - we were on a farm during a clear day, and it let us pull detail out of clouds in post.  Depending on how much work you do after shooting, both filters might provide you with extra options in that avenue regardless, and I think they can be relatively cheap - having just been to a fair during the day I was looking at picking some up actually.  Then again I also like shooting with a flat profile or log when I can - I'm from a computer background rather than camera and I like tweaking all the knobs and dials afterwards to achieve something I like.  In-camera, I'm lost.

Here's to hoping someone has the solution!

Game is designed as a team game. Why cater to a group of people who stubbornly refuse to team up? (much smaller than 80%)

The better solution is to allow small groups (1-3) who are factionless or unitless to fill out larger CW groups and learn to improve by playing with the experienced teams.

Basically, your rank is based on the number of people who are at a higher stage than you. 

For example, let's say 5 people finished at 3000, and you finished at 2999. Even though they tied on the same stage, there are still 5 people who finished higher than you, so you finished in 6th place, and get the 6th rank prize (6-10 or whatever).

I usually run hone, so that's 7 * 7 + 10 = 24 first round, leaving him with 28.  Given that he's an armored, at this point you could just re position or dance away... or dance attack for 7 + 27 the kill.

But then again, we all know how easy it is to kite armored units that can't counter.  Guess I haven't run into a hector yet that fell inside this scenario, or could tangibly get into attack range.
Agreed, this is painful. It hurts to watch.

yea I mean I've read up on so many different sidebars and workouts and at this point, I think I'd just do my own thing. My own workout plan is just what my trainer has given me, and adding additional work because he's only given me a few workouts for each parts of my body that is being focused. 

So like for example, my back/pull day as of now is lat pulldown, rows, facepulls, and trx push ups. But I'm also thinking of incorporating trx facepulls, dumbell rows, and dumbell curls.

If I have to get executed by the government one day, I hope I can request a firing squad. It damn sure has to beat getting fried while conscious or feeling whatever torture their current concoction of injected chemicals inflicts. Plus, a firing squad is pretty fucking metal.

Ideally, though, you'd probably want to go locked in a chamber that gets filled with nitrogen. You'd gently lose consciousness from a lack of oxygen and then never wake up. It shouldn't feel like drowning since there wouldn't be that CO2 buildup that makes your body burn and should thus be drama-free.
Controller has a 3-axis mode (acro) and a 6-axis mode (horizon). I'm fairly new to something this powerful since I'm coming from a WLToys686G, so I stay in Horizon mode only for the most part. Acro mode gives the same trouble when I keep (read: am able) to keep it stable. Right front cuts out. Going to open this thing up in a few since I just got home and see what the problem is.

Sorry, I admittedly stopped reading at the "this only applies to some income" statement to respond. And thanks for sourcing the 52%; I'm on mobile right now and linking is a pain, but most sources I had seen left the top tax bracket open to some interpretation, with a notion that it could be *higher* than 52.

Frankly, I'm not worried about Sanders raising taxes to unsustainable levels, because there's no way a Republican House would assent to any of this. I think that simplifying and shortening the tax code while raising rates is the right move, and if Sanders didn't start where he is, he'd have little room to negotiate. But I don't see any tax increase happening with a Republican House (and possibly Senate).

Vegans should be more pragmatic. They could all work on getting a beef tax to reduce just that one bit of cruelty. Cows are precious, and terrible for the environment as livestock.

Basically. I don't run sword lords without sword breaker because like you've said, melee anti-green is simply not that needed. Sometimes I can just bring Olivia instead of Azura for anti-Hector. Or I run support/buffer/healer on my Falchion lord. Ranged mages always make things easier, but sadly I generate noticeably lower BST opponents with my unmerged mage teams (yes, BST still matters, especially when you're trying to squeeze higher points).

That's pretty odd because he was 100% against interviewing fighters that got knocked out, and the first thing he told DC was how he hated it, which implies that the UFC pressured him to do the interview, however, turns out the UFC told him not to, but he did it eitherway.

When I first started riding there were some 6 foot drops that I would roll up to and think "yea not a chance" and would just ride around them. A few months later I gave them a shot. I ate shit at first but on the second or third try I got it down. Unfortunately they still make me nervous, but at least I know that I can clear them now. Riding with a partner gives you more confidence too.
Well the plain fact of the matter is that Draco is not smart enough to kill Dumbledore.

To kill someone as canny as Dumbledore you would have to be *extremely* creative and capable of lateral thinking in order to get the drop on him, something Draco simply is not capable of. You would have to be aware of his habits and patterns and strike at a moment when Dumbledore was paying the least attention, information Draco could not possibly find.

The only reason Draco knows about the Vanishing Cabinet is sheer luck, from what I know. One of the other Slytherins got stuck in there and came out in Borgin's and Burke's. So the entire situation was, as everyone knew, punishment for Draco because of his father's failings.
Perhaps some make it, but for the most part it seems like poor demographics stay poor for generations. Creating ethnic underclasses like this breeds resentment in both the immigrant population and the native population that has to compete with them. Plus, the 1st generation that remembers how bad it was in their home countries might see their current status as an improvement, but the subsequent generations often resent the lack of opportunities to escape their poverty and turn to gangs or radicalized religion or just plain old justified discontent. It's really hard to solve this issue, far harder than letting poor immigrants in(not saying I'm opposed to immigration, rich and poor).

Sun Tzu has some very useful teachings for limited scale warfare. In total war, victory can't be realistically achieved without either overwhelming superiority (in which case you will get that 100% warscore easily) or a lengthy campaign. Winning a few battles and seizing a few border worlds/provinces is seldom cause for the enemy's capitulation.

I dislike the idea of being able to seize planets by just giving the enemy a bloody nose. Even historically, a peace treaty basically needs to say "Give us these lands or we will do more damage to you than these lands and all the peoples and resources within them will be worth while not suffering as much damage ourselves.", and land is worth quite a bit. After all, signing over territory means not only that you are losing power, but your enemy is gaining it.

A featured branch on any hosting site is backup. A local feature branch is absolutely useless if you aren't hosting that branch online. Also nobody says use git when talking about backing up code meaning locally. You're being semantic. You and I both know they meant git as in github or bitbucket or whatever you want to use. Everybody knows local repos are useless for backing up code.

A bit late and not such an impactful movie, but the scene where Amos Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire realizes his son has been killed. The music grinds to a halt and he's screams "My boy, that's my boy!" It's so gut wrenching. 

It doesn't help that my stepdad would always say "Eddie, your my boy!" at random to my little brother quite often.

Obviously I don't know how bad it actually looks, but generally if you're looking for long-term relationships an ugly vulva won't be a major factor. 

Typically, when people are aroused they have a reduced disgust response. There are a lot of "gross" things about sex, but we generally aren't so bothered when we're in the mood and engaged in sexual activity - so you should take that into account. Also, besides foreplay, most sex doesn't involve a clear view of anyone's genitals - it's usually too dark to see, out of eyesight, or not the centre of attention.
Not to mention the whole "I use this to work out my mommy issues and traumatic childhood instead of getting help, because all kinksters are mentally damaged people just like everyone suspects and no one does this out of a true interest in and affinity for it" angle.
I did one where there was a series of runes in celestial, the runes were different genres of music and the players had to run from one side to the other. Whenever they stepped on one of these tiles they automatically were compelled to dance to that music for about 1minute. Out of game this was hilarious as two of the players started ballroom dancing at the table xD


But the idea of it is to alert whatever intruders were coming in to everything in the dungeon.


The trick is that one on every row was labeled "null" and so no compulsion/music played when stepping on that tile. So they needed to either guess or know celestial to get through.


Some genre ideas to get you started: rock, classical, pop, jazz, orchestral, opera, etc.



EDIT: btw the grid was a 5 by 6 grid so there were 5 tiles in every row for 30ft across (5ft per square so 6 rows)

&gt;Not my point. Reddit has already seized on r/Anarchism for all the violence they advocate, while pointedly ignoring you motherfuckers and the bile you spew.

Besides the point that I disagree with the banning of pinko commie(or whatever his name was) over his "bash the fash" comment, our sub/side has not chimped out 4-5 times this year like yours has. Your metaphorical violence has transitioned to physical violence. Conversely, to my knowledge, no leftists have been thrown out of a helicopter since 1990, this sub has not changed that. 

&gt;What reddit has done can hardly be called censorship. I'd call it fucking cowardice, since the admins don't seem to have the courage to just fucking ban that cesspool.

The admins changed the algorithm of the entire site to keep r/the_donald off the front page. The CEO of reddit was caught editing comments he didn't like. In my book, that is called censorship.
"Natives?" This was one of my favorite movies of the year too so part of me feels like not inquiring about this, but that choice of word feels weird to me since I am Chinese.

&gt; I know Fisher's exact test is essentially a Chi-square test

I really don't think it is. In what sense is this intended? 


It looks like you're trying to compare proportions across months (homogeneity of proportions). A chi-square and a Fisher test would both ignore the information in the month-ordering, but I guess if you have power to spare that's no big issue. 

I don't think it makes sense to compare all pairs of months; do you really want to do pairwise comparisons? I'd have thought if anything some kind of identification for shifts over time would make sense. How many months do you have?

Fuck sugarcoating it, women ARE our enemy (I hate it has to be this way), a friend of an enemy is an enemy, nobody forced women to give men the middle finger and jump in bed with the state. They know exactly what they're doing.

I personally don't think women are as stupid as a lot of people make it seem, they're very very cunning and methodical creatures, that's their very nature, watch an episode of Forensic Files and you'll see. That show made me fucking terrified of ever living with a woman.

The devil offered women the contract, they're the ones that decided to sign it with men's blood.

I watched the rally and I watched the reactions of journalist on twitter. I felt like that night really showed the disconnect between the media and the American people. You see these journalist slander him for being with the people that got him elected and to me the way they complained about it was super entitled.

Because the reaction goes from 2 moles of gas to 1 mole of gas, if Q is less than K you know that the reaction hasn't met equilibrium yet and thus has to progress further. This means that pressure will continue to decrease. Does that make any sense?

Mostly that he probably sent them an executable file saying "look, cheat!".

Valve can do that themselves and I'm sure they do when they need to. Problem is that an executable does not give you the source code which is what they need to see how the things *really* work.

They likely download every single cheat they can find to get what they can from the executables, they don't need people sending them in.

I just look at crowds. I, personally, don't like Roman as he's booked, but I don't like other people I know are actually over. I refer to Roman as the charisma black-hole. And after that pre-taped promo, where he was just barely better even when he had time to re-do/retape, I'm pretty sure it's just who he is. 

I continue to believe he'd be a great heel, or could be an awesome "monster" if someone spoke for him and he stopped that ridiculous Superman punch, but as he is, I don't think he will ever get over with the core fanbase. He's just... not good enough. The WWE is pushing him like the Rock or Cena, and he cannot carry it.

Disagree. Just because things were banned when the game was played 9(?) years ago doesn't mean it would be now.  I think there would have to be to much added into the game for Cod4 to even be an option and at that point it wouldn't be CoD 4 anymore. 

The most fun that I have ever had with a game was with CoD 4 but if it came out next year  and was completely untouched besides updating graphics, it would be an absolute disaster

[A red line indicates infection/inflammation.](http://www.medicinenet.com/sepsis/page5.htm)

&gt;Some authors consider red lines or red streaks on the skin to be signs of sepsis. However, these streaks are due to local inflammatory changes in either local blood vessels or lymphatic vessels (lymphangitis). The red streaks or lines are worrisome as they usually indicate a spreading infection that can result in sepsis.

[Maybe more common for tetanus?](http://www.physicianoneurgentcare.com/blog/telltale-infected-wound-symptoms/)

&gt;If you notice red streaking around the wound or moving away from the wound, seek medical help quickly. This can be a sign of lymphangitis, an infection that impacts the body’s lymph system. Prompt antibiotic treatment usually leads to complete recovery; however, delayed intervention can result in abscesses, cellulitis, or sepsis.

I like to think of Ethiopian food having two different "types", vegan and meat lovers. Shiro is one of the vegan options that is a mostly onion based, amazing stew with classic Berbere Ethiopian spice. Some other vegan options include Atakilt wat, Kik alicha, and missir wat. If you want something a little more meaty there's Doro wat (chicken stew with boiled egg), Beg wat( lamb stew), tere siga (literally just raw meat), or siga wat( steak stew). All this is served on a pancake like flatbread called injera. As an Ethiopian-American, I suggest you get the Beyanetu platter, which basically gets you everything on one plate. Enjoy!

Matt 1: Classic high school football captain douche canoe who stayed in small town america telling the same glory days stories after dropping out of a 6 month mediocre college stint (alma mater actually.) When he realized he realized he wasn't getting attention outside of highschool he literally broke down and went home to momma, I saw it happen. He's still the same 10 years later.

Matt 2: Abusive alcoholic guy, probably genetically predisposed but does absolutely nothing to try to fix up his life, wonders why people stopped hanging out with him after breaking shit nearly every time he gets drunk and trying to fight his friends out of some bullshit broken ego bravado.

Matt 3: Happily spiraling into meth's ultimate endpoint, turned thief already. 

Matt 4: The crazy ex-boyfriend of my (now ex) girlfriend.  Slamming on the door at 4 in the morning, peeling out when the police get called.

Matt 5: That guy you wish your friend would stop inviting to outings because he's boisterous af, always says the wrong thing, and is pioneering new realms of misogyny.

Matt 6: The most chaotic, point the finger/pass the buck middle manager fuck up on earth.  He once made a $500,000 mistake involving a sophisticated fire retardant system he had no business touching. He got promoted 3 months later.  He is listed in my phone as "Bullshit Tornado."
Same here, I'm an excessive sweater, and can't imagine ever going a week between washes. I'm out of work right now so I sometimes skip a day, but when I was employed plus working out daily, my hair would be gross after my workouts and my scalp would get so much build-up.  

Back when I was straightening my (curly) hair, I tried dry shampoo, and couldn't tolerate it. Sure, my hair didn't look oily for that day, but it was limp and flat, and had that distinct "scalp smell" despite the deodorants in the dry shampoo.

Funnily enough, I have a story. So I was going shopping for a new sofa in my family room, and I found a really nice one at *store*. The problem was, it was pretty overpriced, so I left and went to a different store, that was literally across the street from the other one. Inside I'm taking a look around, and lo and behold, I see the same sofa, for $250 less. I thought that that was a crazy margin, and checked to make sure it was the same one, which it was, and everything about it was the same. I took a picture of it, and lifted up the seat(because under those seats, they have all the information on it), and took a picture of that. When I went to the first store, I showed them all the evidence, and when theproposed some scenario, I refuted it with photo evidence. Apparently, the sofas were the exact same, and I'm pretty sure the store manager thought that was impossible, and he refused to price match until I brought up all the photographs. He then price matched it to the same price, walked off kind of pissed, and then I go home with a cheaper sofa.

TL;DR: Found a place with a cheaper sofa(same model), manager was shocked/enraged, price matched, I saved $250.

And the reason I didn't just buy it from the second store was because the saleswoman at the first store was really kind, and I had a nice conversation with her while looking at furniture. Just wanted her to get some of the commission money(I know she would've gotten more if I hadn't price matched, but hey, no matter how nice she was, I'm not going to spend an extra $250 on a sofa.)
1. Declare your smite. If target is evil, proceed to step 2. If not, smite is lost.

2. For the rest of the day (or until the target is dead), add your Cha mod to attack rolls. 

3. If you hit, add your paladin level to damage.  
 3a. If your target is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, this bonus is doubled on the first attack that hits.

4. Ignore all DR the smited creature has.

5. You gain a bonus to AC equal to your Cha mod against the smited target.

Example:  Level 5 paladin with 16 cha (+3 mod), BAB 5 and 18 strength with a longsword.

* Smite an angel: not an evil target, smite is lost.

* Smite an evil orc: Rolls 1d20+5(BAB)+4(str mod)+3(cha mod) to hit. If he hits, he deals 1d8+4(str mod)+5(paladin level) damage.

* Smite a red dragon: Rolls 1d20+5(BAB)+4(str mod)+3(cha mod) to hit.  If he hits, deal 1d8+4(str mod)+10(paladin level doubled) on first hit. Subsequent hits deal 1d8+4(str mod)+5(paladin level).

How so?   I've used binaural beats a long time ago, before I was harassed, with little effect.  I've thought about giving it a try, and even messed about with a frequency generator to try and combat the "noise", with little effect.  I'm a little paranoid about listening to someone else's binaural beats, especially the public and popular ones.  Who knows what subliminal shit is embedded in there.  I dunno what to do about this.

This happened to my daughter. She, along with her friends, would make concoctions on the playground with dirt, leaves, and lemons during recess.

Modders and the community have fixed more about SFV than Capcom, by a wide margin.

* Shitty broken survival mode locking colors? Nah nigga, 1 hit KO your way through it or use infinite health.

* Stages cause issues that interfere with gameplay, resulting in them being banned in tournaments? Nah nigga, mod that shit out in a day.

* Character portraits are red/blue regardless of players' color choice? Nah nigga, take this high quality portrait upgrade.

* "Loading times" are obscene and literally just an animation that kills time for no reason? Nah nigga, unlock that menu FPS cap and load instantly.
 
* Overpriced, meh looking costumes and skins? Nah nigga, peep this [whole database of better costumes for free.](http://streetmodders.deviantart.com/gallery/58269543/SFV-Characters)
 
* Nerfed Mika's butt slap, Chun's titty jiggle, and Cammy's intro/win pose? Nah nigga, revert them changes and get back to that thiccness.
 
* Can't view frame data or hitboxes in game? Nah nigga, here's FrameTrapped and a million other tools and apps.

* Can't learn combos or mechanics because the game doesn't teach you jack shit? Nah nigga, Gief's Gym.

* **GAME DOESN'T FUCKING SUPPORT PS4 STICKS ON RELEASE!?** Nah nigga, take this dinput.dll

* Capcom.sys? Nah nigga, fucking uninstall that trash.

We just need somebody to mod in player 2 rematch option [](/Kappa)

Well, I do remember when literally everybody in this sub heralded him as the greatest wrestling interviewer / podcast host there is. But then he gets a low key WWE gig and oh, how things change...

But then this *is* the most fickle sub I've ever seen so what's new?

He's a semi-regular guest on a panel in a kayfabe pre-show that barely anyone watches.. it's not a big deal.

I'm pretty sure no one needs to worry about him showing up on Raw as a backstage announcer or commentator.
*Totally* legit guys.
I don't have any of her siblings' names, or if she even had any, for that matter. She rarely, if ever, goes by "Coralina" and I've seen more variants of the Isabelle/Belle name when she's in Minnesota.

Ancestry.com is the only site that yielded information and that was, as mentioned before, the social security application. I can't be for sure if it's right, just because a lot of my information is by secondhand sources.

I'm no longer in Minnesota, but I can have my mom do a bit of the research since she's just as invested in this as I am. She should have better luck since she's in the town where most of the records are issued (I think.) I guess I'll busy myself with finding out information in Logansport.

No, you are right. I don't live far from the Dutch border, so going to a GP there or in Belgium would be cheaper than one in Berlin or Munich.

There are some larger, monthly tournaments, but nothing as big as a GP or a SCG event.

But magiccardmarket has started it's own tournament series and will hold an event in Frankfurt this year. Winners will get 1000€ in coupons, which is almost as good as cash. I really hope they are successful and establish an SCG-like series.

well considering he'd be better off with a special cd socket as a captain for things like story mode and better adding to a lock/silence point count on teams for raids/fortnights, might be somewhat significant. again its not something you'd want to do but might be a possibility in the future, i said perfect opportunity since a rate up in only a week away and his sockets shouldnt be too hard to fill since he only has one
Ok thank you
Yea I have played CS quite a bit. I don't think its related because I'm always looking with purpose and focused on aim points, where in PUBG I'm just scanning the room as fast as possible for loot. In third person you can walk into a room and see 180 plus degrees around you at all times, making it much easier to scan without camera movement. In first person you'll have much reduced FOV and I don't think being closer to the ground will help (if that even is a benefit at all). Reduced FOV means more camera movement to scan the same space. I mean, if you actually thought it was better I'd ask if you currently loot in first person at all right now, particularly early game when you think its safe... because I sure as hell don't and don't know anyone who does. I think first person mode will definitely bring something new to the game and change the dynamics of both shooting and looting, but I don't think it'll make looting *easier* in any way. YMMV on nauseating camera action though, everybody will be different I assume.
I do this playing strategy games. Helps me organize my thoughts a bit.
At least you didn't pick it up, then drop in through the glass top stove top.
Whenever parents or others make comments like this, I try to think of an absurd reply and laugh it off. "Oh, that baby is pulling up already? Great. Our son just started brewing beer for the first time. Can you believe that?" Hopefully they can laugh it off too, but it helps to make the point I think you're worried about in regards to others perceptions/comments (i.e. your baby is normal).

Well, I would replace the makeup I have I suppose.  Foundation, powder and a brush, bronzer, and mascara.

Though looking at their website I'm not sure if Sephora actually sells any of the stuff I use.  I'm probably too intimidated to go in there and figure out how to replace my standard makeup with the brands they sell.  So maybe I would just sell the gift card.

Highly suggest to at least try psychedelics at least once in your lifetime. In general they aren't addictive substances and you'll definitely feel the next day that you don't want to repeat the experience for a while (just your mind is exhausted). To me, psychedelics are the most amazing tool to discover and identify problems that have been bothering me for some time, reflect on my personality and take steps to change anything, enjoy the world cause it looks tremendously different tripping, and still live the 60s dancing, laughing, watching weird stuff, and listening to music in a room with neon lights and lava lamps . I've done a bunch on my time in college and they've all had different effects:

LSD: The best drug because of the length of trip, the effects experienced, and the ease to buy/purchase from a RELIABLE source from darkweb. Don't buy acid on street, or if you do test it with a test kit. Most of the street/rave acid today is NBOMe which is similar to LSD but with unpleasant body effects and a much lower lethal dose. Visually the world is crawling in fractals, colors are brighter, and when you close your eyes fantastic neon patterns appear like a kaleidoscope. You don't see elephants or insects (that's from deliriants) but you experience the world in a new way. Cognitively your brain "opens up" so you feel emotions amplified to the extreme, deep introspection and the ability to see your fears and insecurities, and a general sense of euphoria at how beautiful the world looks. Never had bad trips on acid, always felt content and upbeat. You won't be able to try the next day because your body builds superbly high tolerance. You'd wait minimum a week for another dose of acid to do the same effects.

Shrooms: Similar effects to LSD but the visuals and emotions are much more natural and organic feeling. Shrooms makes me want to put on some Floyd, draw, and be more creative and fit into nature; acid makes me fix inner issues and dedicate effort to meditate and reflect. Shrooms are easier to obtain than LSD but ingesting them is disgusting. They taste weird and every time I try them I end up vomiting slightly afterwards as the trip begins.

DMT: Makes LSD look like a margarita against DMT's everclear shot. On DMT you literally lose yourself to your brain. This is the drug that on 3 hits I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience and when I closed my eyes I saw otherworldly landscapes and scenery so vivid it was like real life. When you breakthrough it's the most WTF experience because I saw the figures of gods, aliens, demons, communicating with me telepathically and showing me around the place. If LSD/shrooms takes you into the rabbit hole, DMT drops you into a wormhole to a different dimension.

DPH: Just chug a bottle or two of Benadryl. Scariest moment of my life. Shadows moving around, eerie hallucinations, and strong negative body effects like dry mouth and red eyes. It completely makes you lose touch of reality and actually see things that aren't there. In my case I felt I was living a Courage the Cowardly Dog episode. Never doing it again.

Datura: This stuff is so bad hardly anyone reports anything better than a harrowing psychotic experience, not to mention it makes bath salts look tame. Will never touch ever in my life or any reincarnations.

nahaz wasn't invited due to his lack of ability to help the panel move smoothly. if you watch any panel with him on it, he over speaks about things he shouldn't and disrupts the flow of the overall panel. he also interrupts his panel members so his opinions can be heard, even if they aren't necessary. 


and don't get me started on his hosting capability, because that's non-existent. 


i mean hes a good person to have on the panel, but he needs to fix just little details before he can be an amazing fit.

No. Endure's a Gen 4 TM and Gen 3 tutor move, so if you want that, no HA Moody. Entrainment's a move introduced in Gen 5, if you want that and Moody, no Endure, and if you want the Dream Ball, it has to be bred in Gen 6 or 7. So, compromise.
I wonder why she has a portrait though. It's not like she's relevant to the story or a recurring character like the teachers in Shujin.

It's like Playboy before the advent of the internet. Not many people actually read the articles.
**Pope to Venezuela: avoid more violence, respect human rights - The Washington Post**


VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis appealed to leaders of Venezuela’s government and society Sunday to avoid more violence after four weeks of political turmoil that has produced a mounting number of dead, injured and arrests.


Francis told faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square that, united in sorrow with the families of victims, he was making a heartfelt appeal to “the government and all the components of the Venezuelan society so that every further form of violence is avoided, human rights are respected and negotiated solutions are sought.”


The comments came a day after Francis, the first Latin American pope, expressed frustration that Vatican-sponsored negotiations to resolve Venezuela’s political impasse had not succeeded, in part because of what he cited as divisions within the opposition.


 “All that can be done for Venezuela must be done with the needed guarantees, otherwise we are just making fun of each other and the thing won’t work,” he told reporters traveling with him from Egypt. He said any negotiations under the Holy See’s auspices would require “very clear conditions.”


Venezuela’s opposition broke off the talks in December, saying the government had failed to meet a litany of demands that included release of political prisoners and setting a new date for cancelled gubernatorial elections.


The collapse of those talks has made it harder for the two sides to re-engage during the latest unrest, with the opposition galvanizing an outpouring of public anger with socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who they blame for widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation.


In a public letter to Francis on Sunday, the opposition dismissed the notion that there are divisions within its ranks and outlined its key demands that have been behind the almost daily protests that have already claimed 29 deaths.


 “The only dialogue acceptable in Venezuela today is the dialogue of voting, which is the only way to overcome the crisis and re-establish Venezuela’s kidnapped democracy,” the Democratic Unity alliance said.

I won't preorder most things. Just because I won't buy most games when they're brand new. Too expensive. I'll wait until they come down a bit.

But when I know the game and I'm highly anticipatory towards it, I will. Like StarCraft 2's two expansions. Or a certain other game, should it ever get announced.

The whole "REMEMBER GUISE DONT PREORDER!!!" thing gets really old, really fast. And it's just silly.
I've played some monopoly games over night, took a break to sleep for a little bit, wasn't so much addicting as it was competitive and someone wanted to come out on top...tears were shed at some of these
Interested!
Why, he's not very good
Blood!!!
Yep :((
1 ballot has been rewarded for the [April Blu-ray draw](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorReviewed/comments/63ukp5/want_to_win_some_blurays/). Good luck!
He's clearly just that. Picking on two people constantly and his weight would put him in the obese range when referring to the BMI.
look at you mr. rudey pants
Oilers played like shit. All the goals were from point blank except the 4th goal. Get a grip.

It makes me feel great after the way you reacted and made it seem like what I was saying was completely absurd. The only thing pathetic here is you calling me pathetic to try and have a leg to stand on.
Not Carson.
You can't go wrong with the classic clipper cut styles. Variations on the flat top, Ivy League, Butch, physician's haircut and so on.  They are easy to maintain. They are cool in hot weather. They are clean and hygienic. If your hair grows fast you may need to get your haircut every two weeks to keep it looking sharp.

http://www.howtocuthair.tv/haircuts/

I also recommend checking out [Badger and Blade Forums](http://www.badgerandblade.com/vb/forum.php) for advice on just about everything Man related. Great group of men there and a huge pool of knowledge and experience.
No I don't.
You will find that high school scores and rankings don't mean much after awhile, so don't sweat it dude. People with perfect GPAs in high school have failed college physics, people with shitty grades in high school have gone on to physics PhDs. I recommend you talk to some professors or grad students, maybe the physics community/society in your school, learn about the general process and ways to prepare for a PhD track in undergrad. That being said you're just going in so it's really, really good to be proactive so early--it will help you a lot--but don't forget that you've got plenty of time, and you'll be adjusting to a new environment etc. Make your studies a priority but don't sacrifice your mental or physical health--that goes both for binging on booze and drugs as well as not sleeping and being constantly stressed.

Also don't put anybody up on a pedestal, or any field. It's all relative imo, and all you'll do is make yourself anxious and upset. There is a pseudo-hierarchy of fields in physics in terms of "eliteness" but seriously don't give a shit about it. Just work hard and talk to lots of people for advice, compile it and decide the path for yourself
This sums up what I hear whenever my friends play "hardcore" rock.
I FELL IN THE PIT
From the Ozarks... and you're surprised they don't count too darn good?
If you are using Coinbase, you should ignore the addresses.

You don't have a wallet at Coinbase. You have an account. Coinbase chooses the addresses that are used in your transactions and they tell you what your balance is.
that happen when there are a lot of investment, but 0 use of them, if noone use them and scratch there is no rarity
Tell somebody to do something that they were already going to do. Like if we're both getting out of the car I'll say "Close the door, bitch". Now they either have to accept that they are my bitch, or leave the door open.
avoid plugins if you are beginning. You are just over complicating an already complicated program.
In a 3-4 your Lolb and rolb are at the line of scrimmage and mostly blitz. In a 4-3 your linebackers all drop back in coverage and the only people blitzing are the Dlinemen.
That's not good, not good at all.

You're selfish. You're awful. You're not being cautious.

You zap your magic box to life, anyway. It helps you calm down
They asked me for a ride and didn't tell me it was her ex, two people own the house and I only knew of the other one
Oh boy, there's just something about his writing style that makes hours of reading feel like minutes. I blew through the Mistborn trilogy in 4 days of nonstop reading over my spring break.
Probably downvoted since this is a fairly big generalization. Also a good way to waste a lot of food in your lifetime. Discarding the bad parts and washing the rest is a good way to cut down on your food waste :)

There is only one way to do this. 4 squares folded twice. It's the size of 1 square and not too thick but not too thin that you'll rip through.

Fuck man. You're a hypochondriac's worst nightmare.
I worked for Video Update when they went bankrupt in the early 2,000's. For me, it was a part time job for drinking and gas money. Lots of people actually depended on that job, though. 

They closed stores in my city one at a time. As stores closed, employees from the most recently closed store would help with the week-long process of packing the inventory, removing the fixtures, etc for the next store to close. After that, they were fired and the process began again with a new store. 

My store was one of the last to be closed in my city. Nobody gave any shits about anything. Movies would spend days and days in a huge bin to be re-stocked after customers turned them in, with nobody caring enough to actually do it until the store manager asked us to.

"Reality" tv stars

It's the only thing that would de-fracture the messaging situation. It's next to impossible to achieve too

Matt Hardy's Woken Brilliance.
I wish they did the season pass. I still haven't heard the apple debate despite knowing who wins
Do you think they mistranslated it on porpoise?
Police making arrests. Not drivings taking matters into their own hands and running people over.
I see where you're going with this, but from what I've seen I'd say about 10% of the population on this subreddit are actual coders. 5% of which are from /tg/, and the other 5% either working alongside their favorite servers codebase.


I don't know what an /r/ss13 server would come up with that hasn't already been done by every other ss13 server.


&gt; Quite a few people on this subreddit are unhappy with the majority of SS13 servers, after all.


Honestly, it's just a bunch of different random people attacking servers that don't fit their ss13 status quo. Unless we're talking about the memes that people post shitting on furries which are actually pretty funny.
Are those dead babies
He's the biggest China-bashing shill on Reddit, lol.

They can add as many heroes/villains as they want to the game. If the worry about adding too many of them is that they will be repetitive, Grievous will not fall into that trap. He's one of the most unique villains that could be added into the game.
I like how you just repeated the same few things a couple times just to make the comment longer so it would appear as if you actually put thought into it.
Just curious, anyone know what the motive here was? I just can't understand why this happened.

Wow. Great work man!
People support Trump so this doesn't suprrise me.

There's actually a very strong correlation between the legalisation of abortion and the decrease on crime some 20 years later. States that were first to legalise it saw a fall in crime earlier than states that legalised it later on.

Agreed, from a pure narrative and drama perspective the odds are stacked against the rebels this round. Overall Central will likely start to dominate until things look bad for the rebels before they strike back at the end to win it. It's just like what's happening in Game of Thrones right now.
Dark Riku (or Second Riku) in Kingdom Hearts 1. J was level 40 and dumb. What made it really frustrating was that this was the original release before you could skip cutscenes. So I truly learned, before going back to grind, that there was no way he was taking Kairi's heart.
Steak, a youtubers called cutlerylover did a video on a $1 steak, it looked, bad. And that's putting it nicely.
What a great person Christmas is. Even if Cody and Jessica make jury, she is still going to terrorise them to the point of self eviction.
Paul is the closest thing we will ever get to dr will
Probably just the desire to collect different rewards.
Can I lose the touchscreen, finger print sensor for a cheaper price?

And I use Eclipse because that's what most people prefer around here. I personally code via Netbeans out of class.
So basically a bad job
You should be able to get first pitch tickets for the series. I've done it for a series against the Cubs and I got to the window around 9:30, so as long as you get there early in the day you should be able to get a voucher. As long as your toddler is under 4 you only need 2 tickets; the kids are just going to have to stay in your lap during the game.
Yeah, a nice run along highways leads to less anger and great times.
Of course he's already been called Sampson on commentary
I used to have a car I would wash once a week, and keep it clean. I've had a truck the last 7 years and haven't washed it once. It doesn't look that much different, and the time I'm not having to put into washing it can be used for other things.
The art teacher at my school has the classes in a grade compete against each other. They earn points for different things. When a class gets to x amount of points, he takes them outside to play soccer or some other activity. The kids love seeing the art teacher play sports! He also gives table groups points, not sure what the rewards are for that.
White mage, I always like healing

I only really get stutter when someone joins or leaves. Sometimes there's moderate stutter mid game but I've learned to provide myself with leeway to allot for lag.
I think the comm was suggesting it to shine the light on Salon, not to seek justice for the guy. Could be wrong though
Damn, i'm going to use that.
The fact that *yet another* male student forum was blocked disproves male privilege. I'll cite the Warren Farrell lecture at UoT being picketed and shut down as another good example of this.
Thank you for this video! I've recently been diagnosed and have been trying 10mg Adderall Xr daily and I have seen some measure of improvement. The longer I am used to the medicated me, the more stark the contrast between those days and any off med days. 

Anyway, I suspect my brother and father have it as well. My folks will not be very receptive to the idea of me even having adhd, however I think my brother ought to seek counsel about it. FYI we're 29 and 27. Anyway. I'm thinking of asking him to watch this video and give me his thoughts. He's not, from what I have ever gathered, as self reflective as I am and it's the only thing that brought me to start asking the questions. Thanks again for sharing!
Well, it existed. Just google some things Donald Trump said 10-20 years ago.
I meant for sale. Put it down to language usage differences as I'm from Britain so we use the terms slightly differently.
So Elena is joining the Paul brigade now?

Edit: Fuck you, autocorrect
Carbon I would look at Easton axis or victory vap. Otherwise for Aluminum Easton xx75, or Easton a/c/c  for a carbon/Aluminum shaft
Thank you! I have been asking for and looking for something like this for at least a year now! This is an awesome resource!
DIO and Kira are limited but no one knows what the next banner is. On the 4th DIO and Kira's banner will end and it'll be a while before they come back.
Neat
Never forget the [hot crazy matrix](https://youtu.be/hKWmFWRVLlU)!
Putting aside the really bizarre gender-rage that has cropped up in many of the responses here, from a legal standpoint I don't agree that you are "screwed" if you divorce him. In fact, he may owe maintenance to you. If you funded his college degree (or whatever it is he is finishing), then you are entitled to a big chunk of his earnings. If he is not earning, the court can assign him an earning capacity based on that education.

So, actually, good time to cut the ties but get a good lawyer and you may be able to recoup some of the investment.

As for the temper, get out and get away.
I can understand max blue though. There's an actual pattern to the phase 4's, and there's a maximum amount of blue.
I have personal experience with ALS.  
  
Luckily we had access to V.A. coverage.  
Without it, we would have been bankrupt.  
  
Must be one of the worst diseases to suffer from, as sufferer and family.  
Still devastated...
For my first, we did the rock-n-play in our room for nighttime, and a crib in his room for naps.  It worked out great, except for the fact that I had to get up out of bed, pick him up, get back into bed, feed him, get back out of bed, put him back in the rock and play, and then get back in bed to go back to sleep.  It got old fast.

This go around we borrowed a co-sleeper that will attach to the bed at mattress level.  Scoot baby in the bed, scoot baby out of the bed.  No getting up.  Less fear of baby rolling out if I accidentally fall asleep while breastfeeding (happened once when my older son was about 5 months old.  He was fine, landed torso on the rug and his head miraculously missed the nightstand, but... terrifying.)
Is there a video of that anywhere? I've looked without any luck. I'd just like to watch it again.
"Piece of shit"
Met a girl at work fresh out of college. Exchanged numbers. She texted me that Friday night around 11pm to pick her up at the bar because she was bored.  Well, of course I picked her up. Brought her back to my place and cheered her up. Woke up, hit it again, and sent her on her way.

that only makes his point stronger tho. if you somehow fail a test that you literally can't fail then there's no hope for you

"YOU DESERVE IT" chants lmao
I mean, you're not wrong but it's not like it's exclusive to wrestling.  Steroids are rampant in almost every professional sport.  Collegiate athletic programs of all types get busted for breaking rules and regulations every year.  The phrase "If you aint cheatin', you aint trying" is used in all sorts of sports.  Baseball pitchers fuck with baseballs, hitters cork bats, etc.  Soccer players take dives to draw penalties.  In the NFL you got stuff like spygate and deflategate (which was widely accepted as common practice in the league.) You could talk to people inside about basically any sport and they can give you an example of how people cheat.

All that said, wrestling is possibly the most potent example I can think of.  You hear stories about guys who never shower because they want their stench to be unbearable for their opponent.  When I was like 8 they taught me when to dig my chin in my opponents spine to break his posture. Within the sport there is very little moral condemnation when it comes to bending the rules.  Really the only value that mattered was "embracing the grind" as Mike Goldberg might gaily chirp in with.

Agreed, couldn't have put it better myself. The only times in my life when I have witnessed female orbiting was when the guy was above 8/10. Even during my blue pilled days, I realised how women acted EXACTLY like thirsty men when in the presence of an attractive male. That was what originally got me started on the road to incel awareness. 

And it also got me to realise that most of the successful relationships around me were actually not the result of men chasing women, but women chasing men. Women were chasers.

I like that you misspelled "legible".  Or did you?

McClenahan is a pretty decent T20 bowler though, definitely his best format.

Like the trail by my house, somehow there's a permanent headwind.
After the genji killed me, I told my friend that I was going to switch onto Winston. He died around the same time but said that he would switch to Winston instead and told me to pick something else. I tried picking a different hero but I spawned before I had the chance, and that's what happened. We had a good laugh about it.
The people who make the video have nothing to do with the people who make the QB decision.
It's funny and sad to me to think that all I want to do to these stupid creatures is fuck the morons silly all because of that evolutionary desperation to procreate while still at the prime age of 25
I wear lots of men's clothing. It's cheaper, more comfortable, and it lasts longer. I'll dress more "girly" if I'm going out, but at home? Guys clothes. 

I stole soooo much of my ex-BF's clothes...
Screens? We have one iPad and one laptop and we give the kids 30 minutes a day. More on weekends.
Your feedback has been taken into consideration. Again, the goal of this was to shake people up of their victim complexes and this is 100% open to debate.

Best of luck in your endeavors, and stay strong! Don't let the "negativity" of this video pull you down, it's just meant to bring a new perspective.
Well lets be real that bong wouldn't knock him out either.

My Barnes hasn't had any tags lately. Making me worry xD
Sock puppet accounts point detractors to what appears to be a paid blog article that 'clears' them of any wrong doing.
This is probably the actual case, but I suppose it doesn't matter much given the QB fiasco.

That's a fair point, sorry for unintentionally derailing your comment
But Trump doesn't bother with the presidential intelligence briefings, so he hardly can be said to be listening to his advisors.
It's sad how a company as large as Hi-Rez cannot hire a decent UX designer. This stuff is vital for any software out there .If you give the user an option to create, customise, there should be an option to delete, too.

Yeah. I'm a designer, and it's an absolute nightmare trying to match colors between screen and print applications, and lighting and fabric types can drastically alter the appearance of colors. I bet this looked very different on-screen.
Not necessarily. It could be there is 400 billion systems, but some areas are more dense than others.
So we've been out of town until today. I'll take a picture from the same spot everyday until full recovery. No bamboozle.
I'm Katrina, 20. I'm a trans-girl from the deep south. I'm between colleges right now and unemployed, but doing odd jobs in the meantime. Recently was arrested, evicted, homeless, and living in trap-houses. Finally out of the gutter and living in a much nicer place. 

Death has always kind of followed me around. I've lost grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends from high school, bullies from middle school, so I have always been fascinated by it. I especially love the unique ways different cultures honor their departed. Personally, I've always had an obsession with Tibetan sky burial. We're I given the opportunity, that's how I'd love to be recycled.

Upon meeting the captain of the guard for the first time...

Cleric (me): Is she attractive?

DM: She's actually your long-lost sister you haven't seen in over a decade.

Wizard: You didn't answer his question.
I didn't know this was annoying.  I text the same way I would in chat, so reflex responses, quick answers before the longer explanation in separate sentences... all individual texts.  and really no one had an issue with it I don't think, until I was texting someone who was still on a pre paid cell phone plan that charged per text.  they were not amused.

He passed a justice through the supreme court with ideals that most of the country doesn't agree with, save for the rust belt and the bible thumpers. Not only that, McConnell had to change the rules of the Senate to do it. Doesn't sound like a whole lot.

So, what else has he done?
TL:DR it just makes more sense to have the enemy preoccupied with our smaller forces than to gather a large one and clear out a singular place.

Ive got to imagine that the moon is still occupied by the hive because many guardians dont want a rehash of what happened when crota took it in the first place. I mean story wise there is only 1 guardian thats doing these incredible things and that guardian has 5 friends that they tend to take on the big missions and 2 on strikes and smaller missions. 

So with the few guardians that do venture to the moon, its not a sizable enough force to take it. As well as, currently, story wise, it doesnt really make sense to take the moon. We have enough of a presence along with the fallen to halt of slow the hive and taking out the major leadership keeps them scratching their heads. 

To actually take the moon we would probably have to pull efforts and assets from other places in the solar system which effectively would give the enemies occupying those places time to regroup. Also, we would need to have occupations and leadership on the moon to stop them, again, drawing from resources Guardians may not have in troves to spare in doing so.


Ps: i absolutely hate that we have not cleared the moon. Especially the one guardian from our first mission, his body is still there when you patrol, like wtf bungie. Send someone to retrieve our fallen guardian.
hows mp5? isnt that a hs machine aswell?
An extraterrestrial. To be exact, a Grey. 

I think if I woke up one day and saw that in the mirror I'd probably kill myself out of fear.
So...  thanks Trump?
Unprotected sex.
Thank you!
Wow, thanks for answering! 

I know I already asked my questions, but I thought of another one, so I hope you don't mind me asking. 

Do you think you'll be doing illustrations of some of the other spren like you did for Pattern? I'd be particularly interested in seeing a depiction of Wyndle, partly due to my username, and the Stormfather.

Also thanks, for like the fourth time.
how does one stop it in Wing-Chun
Nia is the 1st person ive ever seen put their hair into a ponytail in the middle of a match
I've been saying this since, like, September.
And it's not a plant.
It'd be a fun thought if you were conceived during the storm but I take it you're not even from there and your birthday would have to be in December of 93.

Anyway, it was eerie.  I was trapped for 3 days.  I lived on that mountain near the north marietta parkway.
That's not gum under there...
Cayde responding with "that asshole is probably dead" would be pretty cool lol
That's a funny looking SKS you have there
Ah, yeah, sorry about bogging down the marriage bit without some context. I forget that the details aren't likely spread beyond US shores, but basically, the bruhahah here stemmed from the fact that marriage in the US confers a number of benefits (and ironically artificial rights) that are not obtainable by living together. It's largely a consequence of using marriage (in the traditional monogamous, abrahamic religion sense) as a short cut for "committed, long term cohabitation arrangement" in the various laws conferring those benefits

With respect to the "requirements of a third person", they key in your statement was "depending on your beliefs". This is where the distinction between marriage as a religious event and marriage as a social construct conflict. To be "married" as a social construct requires no involvement of third parties, except where you're seeking societal benefits from marriage, where we then get into the "positive rights" discussion again. Without those artificial benefits, whether or not any third party is willing to be involved in your marriage is completely besides the point, as it has no impact on you one way or the other.

As a religious construct, however, now we get into an obvious dependency on a third party, and here is one of those messy cases where the negative rights have come conflict. At it's base level, a religious organization is a social construct not unlike a base society or government. It has rules of behavior, usually some form of authority for resolving conflict (whether spiritual or otherwise) and often requires the sacrifice of negative rights in exchange for some benefit (physical or otherwise). It is also (ignoring for the moment theocracies) a completely voluntary association. As such, by the argument of negative rights, you can associate or not as you choose and you may subject yourself to those rules (or not) as you choose but no one can force you to do so.

However, what if your beliefs require you to partake in the ceremonies of a religious order (like getting married), but they refuse to allow you (because you're gay). Well, with just negative rights, you're SOL. Your beliefs are a voluntary thing that you have chosen, and your failure to live up to your beliefs (assuming they're supposedly the same as the religious order you're attempting to participate in) is also a voluntary action on your part, one which no one may deny you. But likewise, their beliefs require them to not certify your marriage, and you can not deny them their beliefs or compel them to act against them either.

This is a fundamental principle behind the US 1st amendment freedom of religion. It's not only supposed to be a bulwark against turning the US into a theocratic state, but it's also a bulwark against people outside the voluntary arrangements of a religious order being able to compel them to violate their beliefs.

If we create a "right to marry", and we apply it to all religious orders, what we have done is create a positive right (the right to be married under the auspices of a religious order), and placed it above a number of negative rights (freedom of association, freedom of religion, personal autonomy etc). Further still we're stepping on the negative rights of a number of people (the entire religious order) because a smaller group (in this case the two seeking marriage) want the benefits of the voluntary association, without adhering to the "social contract" of that association.

So far we (in the US) are reluctant to go down that road, even where we have created positive rights around marriage. The gay marriage debate settled the legal and "social" version of marriage, but left the religious construct largely untouched. However, there is a fear among the religious groups (and not entirely unreasonable given the degree to which we are becoming comfortable with creating positive rights in this country) that at some point in the future, the positive right to marriage will take precedence over the negative right of freedom of religion. Personally I think it's quite unlikely to occur in this country, but if we continue to think of positive rights as the same as negative rights with the same costs and consequences, then it's certainly a possibility.

To your last question, in a lot of ways, yes negative rights are contingent on ability and circumstance. Let's go to the very basics and do a philosophical exercise. The most fundamental of natural and negative rights, is the Right to Life (not the abortion debate version). Almost every modern society recognizes this right, and indeed the founding philosophy of the US is that such a right is yours by nature (or endowed by your creator) and as such even if the government didn't recognize it, you would still have it.

But what does that mean in reality? If you are born in a desert shack, and your mother dies in child birth and your father dies from a snake bite trying to get help, your right to life as an infant is more of less meaningless because you don't have the ability to do anything to maintain it. If you survived, and grew up, you still would have to grow your own food and find your own water, and if you couldn't, right to life or not you would die.

Now imagine that you live in your desert and along comes a new person. You're starving, and you have a right to life. Does this mean you can kill them and eat them? Almost all people and societies say no, you might have your right to life, but so do they.

What if instead, they knew how to grow food. Does your right to life allow you to compel them to grow food for you if you are unable? That is actually something modern societies debate in the abstract. But we could turn it around too. Say they had the knowledge, but hand mangled hands. Does their right to life allow them to compel you to labor to produce food for them and you?

Now what if they already have food? Here is an interesting point. In many societies, there are leniencies and extenuating circumstances for theft in the event of imminent starvation. This is largely a matter of moral and justice, but what does it mean for our rights discussion? Most societies recognize another negative right, which is that of the right to property. But in some societies, when rights begin to conflict, we start "ranking" them. So it might be that your right to life ranks higher than their right to property, and so you may indeed steal.

A doctrine of negative rights honestly doesn't deal with this at all. In simply states that there are some "rights" which all people have by virtue of existing, which they possess and which in theory can not and should not be infringed by any other person. And it recognizes that for these "negative" rights, avoiding infringement is merely the act of not acting against those rights.

Because, as you can see, this means that your negative rights may or may not be of "use" to you depending on your circumstances, we build societies and governments to attempt to secure those rights and create the circumstances such that all members can exercise those rights. Which leads us right back to most of these societies are contingent upon sacrificing small amounts of your negative right (say to property) in exchange for new "positive" rights (like a right to food and water) that allow others to take advantage of their own negative rights.

Or basically, the TLDR version is, yes they are contingent on ability and circumstance and that is why government exists.

And again, I'm not making or trying to pass any moral judgement on whether these positive rights should or shouldn't exist. That is largely a question for each individual society to determine as their members see fit, based on the degree of sacrifice of their natural rights they're willing to make. Another topic for another day, this is also why I also prefer many small societies as opposed to a single global or national one.

Again, hopefully that rambling wall of text answered you question. Feel free to keep asking if you have more.
There are some things you don't WANT to win.

I don't have much sympathy either, but it's the principle here. Words getting you the jail is a step in the wrong direction and the Scottish government wants praise for it. I think people who buy the Sunday Times are deep, dark arseholes, but I'm happy to just let them live their fruitless lives out. I don't want them put in jail. I don't want control over their ideas.
  
  
When we except a law like this, we invite more like it. And before we know it, we'll not be able to call the Queen an state-dependent lay about.

Well we're not friends on facebook anymore and I did want to ignore her and forget her but I just don't know, it's hard especially when she gave me the best almost 3 years of my life and now I'm back to being depressed and miserable.

LMFAO 😂 best shit I've read in a while
Ahh you say that now  but you wait until you are a higher rank and you'll see.
Just got on.....
Which is exactly why I'd wish for it in that scenario - the only possibility to actually make it happen.
gigantic pussy, only made it through college basketball and a free education
go Carr!
How much surface agitation is there? The spinning thing can be oxygen deprivation...
I like you guys too... loved the 2014 season.

We don't talk about what happened a year later though, k?
&gt; anti-theism isn't a religion

Oh but it is. It is the position on matters of faith that you desire the government to adopt, your very own version of a state church. And you wish for the ideology you worship to be the one of the ruling party, just like any good fascist.

&gt;I just think they have no right to shove it down the throats of others or their children. 

Spoken like a true brownshirt if ever there was one. You would strip parents of the basic right to teach their own children of the faith of their forefathers. That, my dear fellow, is tyranny.
Honestly the only rank I could ever imagine this ninja working is low Silver, even when I smurf in SEM/Gn1 they check the common(er) ninja spots, so I would HOPE they would notice a random smoke and start spraying at it..
Playing guitar with long nails sucks so much, though. That's how one gets torn nailbeds, ruined strings, and hangnails for months. (I personally think his nails are super nice, though. I'm a bit jealous.)
That's true. You can't compare yourself to a greater mind like mine ;)
FMK
I thought that there are some words that have no direct translation. Some words can be used as is because it hasn't existed before the creation of the tagalog vocabulary. Also the tagalog word for it sounds too long than the intended original word. It's best to leave the word as is.

Hahahah, yeah, u just keep telling yourself that.
I'm often asking myself the same question. I'm pretty sure it would, in my case. It would get rid of annoying desires, which would make being single a lot less difficult. And I'd probably have an easier time talking to women because I wouldn't feel like they might be afraid of my sexuality. Being "harmless" would probably cure my approach anxiety.
Nice job!
Except it wasn't it didn't show good grappling or good striking it showed both guys waiting. I'm not blaming them for being cautious you're trying not to get knocked out or tapped. I'm just saying I like good grappling and good striking that showcased neither.
https://youtu.be/JipYDDXo5C0 this type of stuff brings me atheist joy.
Are you serious or bullshitting? That's insanely cheap
This article makes me smile.
Looks good, but Jamaal Williams not Joe Williams in the RB group.

I will watch the HBK Jesus movie.
Can't believe no one has bought this up, but there is a likely chance Cotchin can win the brownlow. Proven vote getter and as we all know in the 2010 and 2015 Brownlow, anything can happen. 

How the fuck can Cotchin then go up to receive the medal from Dangerfield after he blatantly and knowingly punched Neale and Ross in the head and stomach respectively? 

What a farce this has all become!

My initial reaction. I don't retract my statement.
They literally copied word for word supremes closing message 😭
Do you like brussel sprouts?
But I thought all gender-nonconforming people scream at you like THOSE MEMES? ^^/S
There is a guy behind them?
I quite liked Ed's line at PMQs.

&gt; It's one rule for them and another rule for everyone else.
You spelled that wrong should be "got my first girl fisting". 
So glad you found a new job. You fucked up my order last week "Mike".
Agree. 4 years 80M would be a horrible deal, 5 years 100M would be worse than atrocious. If that's what he wants, I'd rather he walks. We all love Jose but you don't become a good team long term by giving out albatross contracts, you become one partly by knowing when not to give out deals that cripple your team.

But I think Jose wants to retire a Blue Jay and would be willing to give some sort of discount. Something like 3 yrs 50M would be great, it's fairly similar to what Ortiz has been getting paid recently.
Oh man some guy wrote a piece that was published I think a couple of months back called something like "my family's slave"... I didn't read it because I saw some very good thorough critiques of it but basically his family the generation up enslaved this poor migrant woman and just kept her as a maid/nanny sort of figure. There was something about her end of life wishes that he didn't respect properly, I can't recall if it was about sending her body to her home or her ashes but I think he did some sort of half-hearted gesture and felt like it was good enough.
I'm lucky if I get one. And that's rare.
Anyone else remember this?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1wlGY8oc4Q

Someone should rig two of these to fight.
No, you did well. This is *fake news*
And if Monty does go to the pen, we have another inning eater out there (he could plausibly just throw like 3 innings every 5 or so games that we need it)
No, no. I don't think this is the liberals saying this. This is a tweet that the current POTUS put out on January 11th, 2012. You see, the irony here is that he was criticizing the POTUS for doing that, and then when he became POTUS he did the same thing.

This does hold to what you stated though, "every politician and POTUS has done this." So, you know, it's humorous ( or is it hypocritical?) that the current POTUS complained about it, but when given the opportunity to change things and build a better United States like it was in the past, he chose to do the same thing as all of his predecessors.

I hope that clarifies things for you ;)
That's how I feel about it.  It's a decent all-commers weapon, but the chance and rate of getting hot just doesn't seem worth it
A good analogy that will probably WOOSH for these guys.
When using the tape make lines noting the outside perimeter of the punch rather than the center so you can align the holes better.
That's 100% not true. Read my post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/43kr8n/sanders_to_iowa_students_make_the_pundits_look/czj7y15

Basically you can get plans set up to garnish 10% of your disposable income  for 20 years. When people drop out of school they end up making 30k-40k a year, 10% of that persons disposable income for 20 years is nothing relative to the 40k-70k that they borrowed.

That's not "every pound of flesh" in my opinion.
The feuds were better (because we all knew this was just to hold Kurt over until he faced Brock at Mania), but this match was the best in my eyes.
Nice! Tell me how it goes! :) I was working on an idea so you could use the stock LCD and UI. Save those in case you ever want to do that.
The only wrench I ever broke, was a wrench that I was jumping up and down on.

To be fair, it was on a left-hand-threaded bicycle pedal that my stepson had carefully spent all afternoon "loosening" the wrong way before he asked for help, and he was plenty strong.  I think he ended up trading the whole crankset for something different, pedals included -- it was *stuck*, and I'd just broken the only correct tool I had which might have been able to help.

It's the only wrench out of my go-to Chinesium (actually Indium) kit which has been around for over a decade has ever had any difficulty.  The rest have behaved perfectly and have always stubbornly removed fasteners easily-ish and without any damage to the tool or the fastener.

The whole set was $12 at TSC.  I adore them as being amongst the most practical purchases I've ever made.  They seem to be very fine tools.  (HF sells these, too, sometimes-but-not-always.  The key is the made-in-India nomenclature on the back of the plastic tool holder.)

I've damaged more tools by accidentally welding them with high-current DC than by mechanical force.  YMMV, though, especially with infamously-tight axle nuts (the Jesus Nut, as my BMW E36 and E30 comrades call it).

I still think the lift would typically have more force available than the weight of the car, though, but I do not know typical lift specifications and I am merely guessing as to its capabilities.

A different, less scary method that is a variation of the two:  A bottle jack, a breaker bar, and the car on the ground so that it cannot fall very far?  Possibly with three of four of the biggest people you can immediately borrow crammed into the area inside the vehicle that is nearest to that particular axle end?
Luckily those my career diamond rewards are 14k each.
Dom didn't have multiple people screaming at her for hours. Although the isolation is awful too, it's not as easy to sympathise with.
Good stuff. I like to call the other Sunday show "Meet the Depressed"
By 34 all the real thugs have died.  I'm not sure that's just a theory I'm working on.
I'm enjoying this game now! :)
Well, first off, this is a largely allegorical part of the Bible. A single family of *Homo sapiens* would not be a viable population. 

But in any case, to answer your question literally, it would have to be Seth. Cain became the first vampire, and his only offspring were his childer: Enoch, Irad and Zillah.
I have spent millions trying to get it and Rux didn't have it for me either so I'm guessing they removed it from packs?
South America Contra, Laos Air American Campaign (opium running), Watergate.  But - these things do not happen any more....
I don't play due to lack of trading
I was named after my paternal grandma and then my maternal grandma is my Godmother.
The article is way longer than it should be. I have no idea what the author is going with this other than "women helped too".  Yeah, but in the way you seem to be implying. Honestly, the only take away is women in be multiplayer. Move along everyone.
Hi! I;m so sorry for this experience, please send me a PM if you still need assistance
Yeah, I hate having to go to all these classes I registered and paid for.
It's okay. I still upvoted.
Yep.
Might have something to do with Rhykker's new video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ur2IZZ_XbY&amp;t=334s
Back in the day, I marched with Latinos, I marched women's "rights", I marched with gays...and then when the day came when white males were under attack, encouraged by Obama's administration and the pathetic sidearm of the DNC called the Mainstream Media, huge blocks of those groups turned their backs on me. It was not uncommon to see my former "friends" on Facebag actively wishing and calling for the destruction of white people while furiously virtue signaling about each and every gripe these spoiled, sons and daughters of genuine privilege could ever theorize. What cucks! What degenerates! F the Dems and the psycho Marxists who have somehow grabbed a prime piece of real estate in the "national conversation." Its amusing to see them go down with the ship as the DNC slides into regional obscurity. Never voting Dem again.
Also my go-to site is ashemaletube.com  (if on mobile go down to the bottom and view desktop version) and then scroll all the way down to the links at the bottom and click on "Tranny Porn" it opens a new tab and has every single video uploaded in order of upload time (the main page only shows about 50% of their actual selection)

She is. Thank you.
This referee was really enjoying holding the title up, almost looked like the champion
Ok, such topic has been discussed many times over. The thing is, you have to change our Constitution to put this into effect. And changing the Constitution is like a Pandora's box which might set loose a lot of demons in our political landscape...
And two different styles can't both get boring outcomes? He had to be cautious against wonderboy not to get counter kod. He was cautious against maia so he doesn't get back packed. I'm not saying his style is exciting but there are some matchup for him that won't be a snooze fest.
Fair enough. That's exactly what Breitbart did to Brianna Wu, publishing a piece claiming she is transsexual without ironclad proof, and it was indeed awful. It's not ethical journalism in any sense, and even if it were 100% true and provable and relevant to her opinions it's still at best an *ad hominem* argument.
"Can I have a turn?"
It took me around two years to get all these! That was only because I didn't want to fork out a small fortune for each. Patience is key!
Sadly the Islamists only do the second step because they think once you committed jihad in the name of allah all your sins of the past and future are forgiven.
It's on my bucket list. I also want to take a Via Rail train through the Canadian rockies to Vancouver. I fell in love with the rails the first time I rode Amtrak. I just wish our trains were more efficient. I could wake up in London and be in Vienna by dinner time by train. That is a distance of about 1,000 miles, the same as New York to Milwaukee, which takes a full 25 hours on Amtrak. That sucks.
devil horns were because hes the devil of hells kitchen no?
I mean, I think honestly, for most of them, they'd mention that they have Irish ancestry and that's it. Most of them couldn't tell you shit about the Troubles or NORAID or anything else. The vast majority don't give a shit period, except when it comes to family history and the like. The people who donated to those terrorist groups were a very small group of fanatical crazies.
Being correct rather than having feelings.
I'm shocked that I had to look so hard to find these guys in this thread. I had assumed (and hoped) they had a bigger following.
Periscope up?
Is there a filter for this thread like "doesn't contain 'Amazon'"? 

Yeah, they fucked up, we get it.
A non-zero amount of people in this thread have suggested she's getting darker this season, but I seem to remember her in s1 telling her brother she'd remove his hands if he touched her and then she burned a human alive for a vengeance sacrifice so like

her not really "getting" Jon Snow as a big deal after Ser Davos' *spectacular* hypeman job is probably the chillest anyone in the seven kingdoms has been about this sorta thing.

I don't know, am I crazy here? 

Telling Varys he gonna get burn'ted if he tries to have her killed again is like. Base-level monarch stuff in this universe. That's the Westerosi version of him signing an NDA. That's like, regular Tuesday shit for a royal advisor. 

I don't get it. How is this "darker"? Unless you mean the literal color of her dress? 

She is being pretty evenhanded and it's not working out for her, so she best get darker soon. This though? This has not been darker. She set a tent of dudes on fire. She ate an animal heart in a spooky horse ritual and swallowed her own vomit. She locked that dude and that lady in a vault forever, all during her set-up phase. 

In no capacity has this been "darker" so far though.

That's impressive. I've only been able to climb from 1500 to 2000 in solo queue, and it was hard when. What's your main?
Royals easily, that's why I got 2013 as my beaters and I can keep my 2017 pair clean
Race mixing is not genocide. Yeah there will be no Whiteskins on Earth but it's not like they were killed off; they're just brown now. And that's a good thing when you look at how racism is correlated with skin color. No skin color difference = no racism.

For example: Neanderthals aren't here as their own race anymore, they've been assimilated into the greater human population. Europeans and Asians are up to 10% Neanderthal so they aren't extinct. Another example would be dogs and saying that dogs caused the extinction of wolves. Even if wolves died out tomorrow, they still exist in Dog DNA.
Hadn't Thought of it that way, thanks I will go try that out

You know when someone is conversing you get the meaning of the world from context right?

Did you think he was crying because his debt is slightly hindering him in life? Is that what he meant? "OMG I've got this debt that's mildly annoying"? That's how you took his meaning? It's a slight problem? 

This is what you think the current young generation means when they say "crippling debt"? 

You realize that isn't even the definition of the word like you are saying at all right? Because it isn't. 

crip·ple
ˈkripəl/Submit
verb
gerund or present participle: crippling
cause (someone) to become unable to move or walk properly.
"a crippling disease"
synonyms:	disable, paralyze, immobilize, make lame, incapacitate, handicap, leave someone a paraplegic/quadriplegic More
cause severe and disabling damage to (a machine).
"over-lubrication might well lead to piston seizure, crippling the engine"
cause a severe and almost insuperable problem for.

Where do you see "lesser impairment or hindrance over time"?

&gt; ...while $1m CEO salary is morally questionable...

I mean, the board of directors wants the most skilled CEO they can get, right?  If they offered $12.50/hour + all the coffee you can drink, then they are going to get the kind of CEO who would find that to be acceptable.

Thank you. This is basically what we have been doing (except instead of feeding tube we are using a baby bottle nipple, we tried with a lamb feeding nipple but it was too big for him). I was worried about his poop because its pretty runny and light brown/dark yellow, but the first couple were solid and darker.

However, it was too late for colostrum by the time we brought him in, so we have to hope that he got some. He was feeding from his mum a little bit, but not a lot.

I'm glad to hear that usually cough it up if the breath in any formula the wrong way. I was very worried when I heard him cough yesterday, but he seems to be fine. 

I will try your method with the tube on the syringe. It sounds like a good plan. I'm glad to hear the sleeping a lot and not taking to the bottle easily are normal.
Right, which of course is where I am going. . Where I have been (in Latin America) it is like old-school US. The women are very respectful, they don't think like American women, they want a man to "treat them right" but they are not looking to trade up.
What's the version number on that? Jailbroken here and want to downgrade to that
Metformin is free at publix and spironolactone is $4 at walmart. The 
spironolactone would be better for the hair loss if it is due to elevated testosterone. If you cant take medication for whatever reason (or want to get pregnant) - be gentle to your hair. Limit ponytails and wet hair brushing. I use selzenblue shampoo which is similar to the nizoral ($11 amazon).
Pro controller. For playing with single joycon if you need to I would put on auto accelerate so you have one less button to worry about while holding that little thing awkwardly
Seattle can support it. Other municipal areas can't. Most of these studies that come out in support of a raise are from cities.

because of who I support in the house makes me an evil person? wow, we crucify Paul and Josh for bullying then go around and call other people evil people? I don't like what Paul is "doing" but don't call me evil because I support him, its a game
Very true, sadly.
I have a habit of adding extra thoughts in separate messages. Pretty often I realize that the last 5 or 6 messages in a group were sent by me and half of them have less than 5 words.
She didnt create the misleading edited video though, her mistake was viewing it and think it was the truth and then retweeting it. 

A better example would be believing the answer to complicated math formula  and then later somebody points out some mistake made within the calculation. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't like her signaling, she has yet been willing to take in a refugee and she has all those empty bedooms, but at least she admitted she was wrong on this. Baby steps.
True. Probably replacing the type 100
Mine is untradeable lol

The only time in life when starting at 1 would have been the right thing...
Drink 5 gulps if Henry does something stupid like lose the rings.
Tunnel boring is so cool.
Double up on vitamin c for the next few weeks. Don't pick at it it'll make it worse.
I don't think Lengel beats out O'Shaighnessy

Also don't think Fleming beats out Mcdermott
This is incredible!
It's the reverse of water boarding at Guantanomo Bay. If you don't know what it is, that sounds awesome. But with cheesecake....
Treat Yo Self!

Yea the serum works great, but I've never been able to put a finger on it's rather pungent scent. Mizon has an HA serum? ooo Which one?
That's really cool! :)
It does seem likely to be more difficult to keep clean.
ye you've got it all wrong
Since this AMA is going to end soon I'm just going to wrap up all my final questions here

1. Which people do you believe who are great community contributors to /r/diepio?

2. Have you seen any good quality helpful resources being posted by any redditor?

3. The Moderatorion team is based on dedication, contribution, friendly, active, nice, banned user managing, maturity, civilization, submission guideline rule following, helpful people on /r/diepio right?

Not to rebut, just to point out some &lt;50%s:

Carolina Hurricanes are 10-12 (83.33%)all-time in series and have 1 Cup

Dallas Stars, 29-30 (49.15%), 1 Cup

New York Rangers, 53-55 (49.07%), 4 Cups

Boston Bruins, 57-64 (47.11%), 6 Cups

Ottawa Senators (Original), 4-6 (40%), 4 Cups

Calgary Flames 16-27 (37.21%), 1 Cup
M: Nice!
Did they actually legally do this? Is anybody outside of YouTube enforcing this?
So you were on the squad that helped defeat the Collectors? What was it like? There's been plenty of work written about Shepard fighting the reapers, but barely any about the "suicide mission". I guess people want it hushed up because of what Cerberus has done since then.
I thought i was a badass and rode my motorcycle in shorts. After parking, my calf made contact with the exhaust pipe for about a third of a second.
I think the question was: "What are those for? Obito?"
Dammit, I wish I had myself some weedz rn.

I am, as they say, dankrupt, and it makes wrestling significantly less fun to watch.
The only thing I see nonstandard is that there is a space after the 25. Otherwise idk!
If you would like to claim this post, please respond to this comment with the word `claiming` or `claim` in your response. I will automatically update the flair so that only one person is working on a post at any given time.

This is a(n) image post, so please use the following formatting:

---

**Art:**
---

A picture is worth a thousand words, though you definitely don't need to use that many to describe the image. Please attempt to just give a general idea of what the image is. For example, "A man and a woman sit in what appears to be a gondola. They are facing each other and are far away from the viewer. The lake that they are on glitters in the evening light of the setting sun behind them, and the deep blue and purple sky fills the rest of the image." Add as much detail as you feel is necessary.

---

**4chan &amp; Pictures of Text**
---

* When writing the Username and Timestamp headers in 4chan threads, only include the Username and day of the year if either changes.
* Standard 4chan header formatting (Military time is used, i.e. 4:20:00 PM is written as 16:20:00): **UsernameMcAnon**, 4/20/2017, 04:20:03
* Feel free to make spelling and grammar corrections if you truly believe that it will not significantly change the heart of the content, but include a disclaimer if you do.
* Regarding 4chan or other threads, it is always to the benefit of both the transcriber and the reader to find the original thread. Always try to find and include a link to it if possible.
* If there is quoted greentext like this:

&gt; be me, lvl 3 cleric 

&gt;surrounded by mind flayers

* ...then make the &gt; sections each a full paragraph break apart. Like so:

\&gt; be me, the Vice Head Transcriber  
{blank line}  
\&gt; writin' formatting advice all day long

**Note:**

Most of the 4chan greentexts are already archived online in their original state. A large percent of the time you can find the original post by going to Google and putting in one sentence from the greentext image inside double quotes; this will make Google search for the exact sentence. The more unique the sentence, the better luck you'll have in finding the original post. Then you can just copy / paste / format and it will go much quicker!


---

**Comics**
---

* Please ensure that any text in the picture is transcribed verbatim rather than just being paraphrased.
* Write the text and describe the scene in the rough order that it is intended to be seen. For example, if there is text at the top of the panel, then a scene in the center, then more text at the bottom of the panel, perhaps a punchline, write it like:

**Panel 1**

**Person:** This is a sentence that is going somewhere funny!

*(Description of the scene)*

**Person:** This is the punchline!

* In short, transcribe the picture so that the heart of the joke remains the same, and so the transcription would be as funny to read as the image of the comic.

It's an awesome recipe! So simple but so tasty. I think it usually has rice in it, but skipped it in favor of more egg.

Nice Daniel Defense!  I want one of those so bad but they are crazy expensive.
I also live in Illinois, but down here all the storefronts are empty and have been since I've moved to this town 6 years ago.  Small towns don't kick old businesses out to jack up the rent for others simply because there is rarely a business that want the building to begin with.  In the next town over one of the buildings on main street just collapsed last week.  It was on the news.
Alan?
my cooking isn't going to impress anybody
Select the first girl then you can select a 2nd one. You won't be able to have 2 girls during an event.
Wasn't that kind of always the point though? I never really thought of him as the victim, just somebody pushed to the breaking point and then taking it out on the world around him, justified or not.

There's usually some catharsis in any fantasy of taking on/tearing down the world around you, especially when it seems unfair or against even shittier people like the skinhead he encounters, but I don't recall him being portrayed as particularly sympathetic. It's been like a decade though, maybe I just misremember.
We waited for August 1.
Network forks.
Non-event?
That was awesome. Any tips on how to knuckle ball it like that?

ty! i think i want to read the entire thing. how long is it and where does the anime end it off? (i heard its the entire series but which volume)
(I only just finished episode 3, please no spoilers!!!)
But you do have to admit that this woman and people who have/might make similar choices *are* part of the pro-choice group. Politically, pro-lifers are going to use it as a point to demonize a woman's right to choose, and some probably believe in their deluded minds that there are lots of people out there wanting to run around, hook up, and abort babies with no responsibilities, but regardless of those sensationalized delusions the association is there by definition. No?
That's neither what I said nor meant.
I can stop by now if you're still available. :) Adding your FC now.
You dont have a argument and me seither. Whats your problem?
yes them as well
Might not be your typical "jeje" but it wouldn't surprise me that there would be a number of kids there with attitude problems, probably spoiled kids.
John Markoff = The loser that got Keven Mitnick in federal prison? Why you'd invite that clown?
I'm not sure you actually understand the paradox. The paradox is that life is supposed to be everywhere by now, but we see no signs of them, that's the *paradox*.

Here is my favorite article on it: http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html
Gotcha, thank you!  I assume this will break whatever saves I have with that DLC right?  But that's okay, I'd only be doing this to continue playing MP, and re-download when I get back to ME3 in my current trilogy run.
With us, bathroom use is a solo activity.

The only time we walk around nude is from the shower to the bedrooom, otherwise, we at least have a robe on.
Same, but I stopped at one multi.

3SRs, 7Rs.

Lesson learned. 

Until the next temptation.
Oh hey fellow Portuguese spidey fan 😀
tell us why, exactly, his viewpoints on climate change and the influence of the wealthy over the government are completely invalidated by the size of his bank account?
The first bonus stage in the ds trauma center. In part because it can and will kill you in under ten seconds.
Definitely a troll, and a successful one. OP admitted as much on /r/enoughsandersspam. 

EDIT: Actual post of OP admitting it. https://np.reddit.com/r/enoughsandersspam/comments/43li1n/obvious_troll_is_getting_rpolitics_to_upvote_a/czj3ckx
#HITER: A REAL MENSCH.
If you get kicked the same day after your cool down for being kicked too much expires, you get another cooldown. OP could just be unlucky like I was in my silver days.
How many people?
attempted rape
Consider buying some febreeze and a flyswatter. The wife and I used to make a game of how many we could tag and swat.

Febreeze slows them down (makes their wings get sticky) and the swatter does what swatters do.
If no one pulls a fridge from under that ring I will be disappointed.
The second "t" in "potato" sounds more like a "d" than a "t."

It's "well" you uncultured sack of Hagrid-haggard fatback! "Roast me well."  Jumpin' fuckin' Jesus, you are the cuntingest cunt that ever cunted a cunt.
What, and miss out on the ten million volts and the chance to go boom?
We had a beautiful Divine Liturgy with Bp. Nicholas. He gave a really wonderful homily. Then we all got together and ate lunch as a community.
I got downvoted because this sub is hyper vigilant about anyone going against the hive for ANY reason.   Then they call themselves feminists who support women (except the "wrong ones" like me, who don't accept their authority on all matters).  Sigh.  

Students need guidelines and to work within them. It just cuts down on competitive fashion, and overly provocative bs. 

God. The things I would have worn (and did on the weekend).  I looked like a full blown hooker advertising my wares. I wish I'd had the common sense at that age to stop myself.  It took someone from school seeing me and telling everyone I had my ass hanging out in short shorts, and a sports bra I was pretending was a crop top... It was true of course, but I'd concocted some fantasy of what I was "making work" that was pretty good indication of my immature imagination and reasoning. My inability to define my own boundaries.  I was asked out/pressured by skeevy guys who were way older, and instead of being concerned (which I should have been), I took it as testimony to how mature and fashionable I was.. 

 Professionalism matters, and school is not a daycare after-party.. It's a school for education.  There's plenty of avenues for self expression in extra curricular and hobby activities.
Crim Dieci, 1 TC, and 2 CC3 for crim suns?
Low carb/Keto/low glycemic diet is a must. Being more active will help, as will building muscle and lowering body fat. It is a lifelong condition that needs to be managed so make sure the changes are sustainable. At the insulin resistance stage it's more likely to be helped entirely by lifestyle changes whereas when it becomes type 2 diabetes it's a lot more difficult (not impossible, but strict adherence is necessary when you no longer produce enough insulin) so the point is to not let it progress.
I can accept that, thanks!

I messaged you on psn.
I bet you would, shilling don't pay what it used to does it! lol
Hi. I'll hatch your egg for you. :) I'll add you now and will come online if you happen to still be available.
Maybe people being passive is fun to them and killing people isn't fun. Different things are fun to different people. Pros grief in competitive with each other because it's a video game. It's suppose to be fun no matter how you play it. Maybe games aren't for you.
I personally am not a Jain, I'd just been studding and researching the religion a few months ago. It is quite interesting as they follow a policy of hyper Pacifism (kill nothing at all, in some sects this means you wouldn't be able to eat say potatoes as you would be killing it). As they are part of the Dharmic religion group they also have the same general philosophy as Hindus and Buddhist where the ultimate goal of life is to get out of the cycle of re-incarnation.

The religion is quite small with only about 4 million adherents. 

Recently I have been studding Zoroastrianism but it is hard to do with so few resources on the religion in English, all you can find are a few translations of the Zend Avesta but that is about it. Unfortunately this religion is a dying one and might not be around in a few generations as many are somewhat hostile to the idea of converts.
I am letting you know that part 4 is out.
Happened with me too, I had a professor for my upper division CS class. He was somewhat young, in his 30s, but he was also a super serious looking person. He was dedicated to his work and family, taught the class using real life examples and was just someone that you'd never expect to be into Gunpla. Then somehow on the conversation I was having with him in his office hours, I brought up one of the kits I had on backlog and his face lit up. He pulled out his phone and showed me his recent RG Destiny Gundam. It wasn't even just him though, he then swiped through and showed me his kids' SD builds also and how they recently started getting into Gunpla too. He asked me what kits would be awesome for them and what else would be good to get them into it like him. It was an amazing experience!
I think you should do it. Punch her in the fucking face. She deserves it.

Hey!  

The technological innovation I wanted to highlight is paper, as it definitely makes the jobs of historians much easier when you can have a rather long-lasting written account of events!  

After being invented in China in the late 1st century CE (although some claim it may have been invented earlier), paper gradually spread through the travels of Buddhist monks and other merchants along the Silk Road.  For example, it reached Central Asia about 500 years after its invention and paper fragments with Chinese writing have been found as far west as the Caucuses by 800CE (even if it was never fully adopted in that area). Notably however, paper didn't get adopted in India despite the penetration of the Silk Road into it, so this diffusion wasn't equal.

Relating a bit more specifically to my area, the story is that Muslims discovered paper after capturing Chinese papermakers following the Battle of Talas in 751 CE in Transoxania (modern day Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan area) .  This story is probably a bit apocryphal  and it is much more likely that paper-making had already been established in Central Asia after having spread from China earlier along the Silk Road, as evidenced by Central Asia having its own paper styles and manufacturing techniques.  

Talas itself was at a crossroads on the Silk Road.  Being a hub first allowed for paper to spread into the Central Asian region, as well as giving a large economic incentive to the Abassid Caliphate to capture the city.  So even though one could argue paper was introduced to the Muslim world through the conquest of Talas as opposed to Silk Road trade itself, one can say that the Silk Road definitely contributed to Muslim interest in the city in the first place, allowing for paper to be discovered and spread further west!
I mean look at beach volleyball or regular volleyball vs their male counterparts. Yeah sex sells.

Wow they all look great!
This works?!!
Right? I always get yelled at on this sub for liking the holy trinity because it's supposedly some outdated MMO formula.
I definitely don't! I've only busted it out two or three times. It's just fun to see the "oh Shit" look on their faces.
The first quote was comparing the amount of suffering experienced by male and female rape victims. The second was specifying a particular kind of suffering that male survivors of rape often experience, not measuring which gender's pain is greater.

These answers don't really say much at all.

The first three can be interpreted jokingly. If not, it doesn't necessarily show that EE dislikes Black as a person. The last one doesn't even concern Black specifically.

If this is the only evidence there is that EE hates Black, then I'm gonna chalk this all up to drama-seeking.
Do you mean with their high?
I know you mean this is good faith but you know your answers already. They are one of the posters that also never source info. ?
Frankly, it's often going to be a winning line, particularly if they have a second Rhino in hand or a Wingmate.  It's a pretty brutal tempo play and so long as you can make your next turn matter, the tempo loss will outstrip the RHino value.
Nah unfortunately not :/ 
Fairly sure it's the women's one but that doesn't really make a difference to me
Could someone be willing to help me with a spider farm and having it be automatic

Yeah, but BTC futures aren't down $300.

The voting stances of journalists has nothing to do with whether one party will spread misinformation more than the other. Most self-respecting journalists have standards. 

I would actually say that democrats are much less likely to spread misinformation because more "liberal" news services are decentralized (more than one network is considered liberal) versus "conservative" news which is centered around Fox news and its subsidiaries.

Nico is eligible for the ahl next year. It may be beneficial to get him some ahl time especially if he needs some more time to fill out his frame... Knowing Hextall and how he likes to be conservative with prospects, my guess would be Nico will start in the ahl next year. It will largely depend on his performance in camp assuming the flyers take him at 2

That's not what function over form means.  It means that function is more important than form, not that form is ignored completely.  A great example of function over form would be increasing a phone's thickness to add a larger battery.

Different play styles like not stacking healers and tanks and actually allowing for 2+ damage characters to be played. Look at the past meta in Overwatch, 3-4 tanks and 2 healers on every team just a little while ago.
Regarding living arrangements- most of the time your relocation package includes closing costs and often compensation for market fluctuations, so you're not likely to lose much buying and selling homes every few years.  So buying vs renting is mostly up to your financial situation and whether you want to own or rent.

I'm on city #6 and have owned my home for the last 2 stops.  I don't ever intend to 'settle down' - part of the reason I like my field is because I get to see the world.
They will say that no matter what. They are already complaining that Superman being seen as a beacon of hope "wasn't earned" in BvS, therefore JL is pointless. They will not be satiated. They would want WB to make ANOTHER 250 million dollar movie set between BvS and JL, and it would have to feature numerous scenes of Superman saving people. Oh, and these scenes can't be part of the main plot, either. they have to be one-off scenes that serve no purpose other than to illustrate that Superman is Superman, I have also been told that.

Just ignore them.

I remember a couple of months ago Smitty banned a streamer named dirtyrandytv for "Cop Baiting". All dirtyrandy was doing was waiting for the cops to leave since the cops were camping the drug spots waiting for someone to pull up to arrest them. So then smitty teleported to him and froze him and dirtyrandy tried to explain the situation and he didn't believe it even though he was still streaming and banned him. Dirtyrandy went on teamspeak to speak to another admin and smitty banned him there before he could even say anything. Dirtyrandy then went on the forums to make a complaint and smitty later saw it and locked the thread and then later deleted it even though he basically explained everything that went on before and after the ban and provided the VOD for evidence.

Yeah I figured. I'd really only care once you get to all-pro, then I'd be surprised if you still got matched up with trash teams.
On the contrary. You are putting her in the friend zone, women don't like it any more than men do. She isn't used to it, so she'll do what a lot of young boys do. Assuming she actually likes you,  rather than accepting it, she'll try to get out. You now have the power to let her out of the friend zone.

"Your mother says that because she married a lord. Had she married any lesser noble, I imagine she would be telling you a different story, my lady." Steffon replied. "Or she would be spinning the tale to her favour. Perhaps you should ask your mother how many suitors she had waiting for her, hm?" Steffon said with a chuckle.

"You are close enough that some lords are wiling to bet on a tragedy." Steffon commented, not noting how insensitive his words may have sounded. "If you wish, you could announce yourself, or speak to your father, that you are ready to meet potential suitors."

"If you did that, you would be meeting all sorts of lords, and your father would probably hear your word out if you took the initiative and sought to ensure your choice."
Please stop
And then you just give up after a few days? You could've at least been sneakier with your healing if you didn't want any girls to know.
This is not the kinda shit people do for money.

The F80 2200kv are really beasts! I have them on a 5" build because 5" just feels faster to me on 5s/6s, but those motors are definitely the best performing / smoothest motors I've ever used! Just be careful, I've broken a few arms because of the extra weight of the F80s

when i first saw the gameplay for bloodborne i was bummed about the lack of shields but after playing it i thought that was one the best parts of it.
The feel is far more realistic than a fleshlight or tenga style toy to me. Because of the material you cant really have the crazy mode textures of those, so they focus on slow undulations and changes in tightness. Additionally, the material has a bit more resistance to it. My Janine is pretty phenomenal. The actual entrance is not too unlike a humans (minus the scales), from the side and back it looks just like any other sleeve (albeit a bit heavy duty). Internally it has a wonderful feeling, the entrance is just tight enough  for you to be slow on entrance, then it opens out a little then tightens back up, with wavey texture the whole way along. Or it can be used the 'wrong' way around for a far tighter (too much for me, but some like that kind of thing) and more textured experience. The colour is amazing (I got mine in a custom blue/metallic brassey/bronzey colour that looks amazing). You can also insert normally and plug the end (with a finger for instance) to create varying (up to insane sleeve collapsing) suction. 

I dont have experience with the other toys but as far as I know the Janine is right in the middle of tightness and texture and feels the most similar to vaginal penetration (well, as far as a lump of silicone can). Only downside is the lube, you do need to use good lube with it, I use a hybrid silicone (sliquid silk) for the extra longevity and its great, but thin cheap pure water based things dont work so well (unless you want to reapply mid session). Cleaning is super simple (rinse through with very hot water, clean the gunk out and leave to dry). Drying does take quite a long time, but it's not any worse than a fleshlight.
Fuck Facebook, hail Satan.

I think it's always important to support the rights of the marginalized in our communities.  Do you believe transgender people cause some harm in society?

Lol at the title,people are so salty. What Mir said was insensitive but Mir is a legend too and deserves respect.
Their growth is simply because they merged amazon prime (which practically everyone has) with their streaming service and innovated donation methods. Their ridiculous rules will, and have, create a lot of drag. It's like Nickelodeon (Twitch) versus Cartoon Network (YouTube), Cartoon Network innovated by broadening their audience with Adult Swim. Give it time. 

You can't grow without taking smart risks and I think Ice is taking a smart risk by moving over to a less restrictive platform.

Maybe you should take a business 101 course.

Not at all weird. Music can get associated with all sorts, and nostalgia is a big reason that I often do listen to some things rarely, but with feeling; or don't listen to one particular album at all, ever.

One that's significant for me is [The Great Eastern](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJayDFdzHC26DT47x8M3TfBG1cXlggo6k) by The Delgados. It's quietly one of my favourites of all time. I listened to this a great deal in a period of my life that, retrospectively, felt like a kind of mania that was the precursor to a serious (to me) breakdown. Once that passed it took a good few years before I could hear it again without anxiety, but the fact that I can, and do from time to time, is a reminder how far I've bounced back.

One I still can't listen to is Mistabishi's *Drop*. That one I'd had on loop during one night that caused me a lot of upset for a long time, and I haven't dared try listen to [From Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IWlF-Vx7cE) in particular, since it would reduce me to tears in an instant ever after.
So in this specific one the only card that really sticks out is Esper charm. Because of the variance of spells there is really no "pro color" choice and instead it is looking like you are looking to hit 1 of each color before turn 3. That is the most important thing in this deck because you have no double of the same color spells. The best way to assure one of each color by turn 3 is to have 12 of each source in your deck untapped.

Currently I am looking at:

12.5 Blue / 10.5 Black / 8.5 Plains.

Your priorities are straight, but if you want to be able to cast all of your spells basically from turn 3 on then you will need to slightly increase your black and white mana in the deck.

2 more Flooded strands and perhaps one more dual would be correct, but honestly you are very close as it is. Basically if you can sacrifice 1 blue source for a White/Black source that is untapped that would probably be your biggest gain overall.

What's happening in Venezuela is in a completely different scale than what Trump did.

Recently the venezuelan opposition held a poll that resulted in 7.6* million people voting against the constituent change Maduro is implementing without the people's previous approval. Because of this they rigged the "Constituyente"'s votes to have 8 million people in favor, just so that they can say more people are with it than against but the reality is that only around 2 million people voted in the elections, which shows that only around 17% of the country is with Maduro and that includes everyone who voted because they were threatened to lose their jobs.

Edit: more accurate data

The L is missing it's historical boost settings. I have my L spaded, and while I love that thing, the 38K is better because of the boost settings. 

The L just doesn't have the engine power to compete. Roll rate and air brakes are the only advantages, but those aren't so important when compared to climbrate and acceleration.

How so?
You don't have to invite her.  It doesn't matter if no one ever throws a baby shower or that side.  The person throwing the shower (who, according to strict etiquette, shouldn't be your parents, thus leaving out the potential awkwardness of your mother not inviting his mother) gets to invite whomever she wants, and she is not required to invite more people.  Suppose she had planned a surprise shower for your side.  She might not have been able to find contact information for your MIL.

You and your husband should send her something in writing saying they hat you do not want her to post anything about your future children online ever.  Not pictures, not names, not birth date, not weight and length, not that she's so happy to be a grandmother now that baby has arrived, not that she's super thrilled to have visited baby, nothing.  Go on to say that unless she has confirmation from you otherwise in writing, this does not ever change.  (You may want to exempt texting too, so he never says okay to some long text and she claims  that he was saying okay to posting something.  In fact, you should probably say that you must explicitly and specifically say that that particular thing is acceptable.)


You say that you have a close, loving family.  I'll bet that you have an idea in your head of what a grandmother is.  I'll be that one or both or all of your grandmothers was/were that amazing image that you have.  This woman is not that.  Not everyone is a wonderful grandmother.  There was a post recently about a woman who pinched the baby to make it stay awake.  She's not the grandmother you fantasize about either.  If you want your fantasy, you'll have to look to your family to fulfill that.

You already find this woman terrible to deal with, and you sound like you want to raise your child to think that she's great.  I'm not saying that you have to have no contact with her, but you've already said that your husband can't tell her no.  That speaks to her being manipulative at the very least.  You don't want your child to think that's okay or normal.  You don't want your child to grow up suffering that treatment the way your husband did.

Just because she's not the grandmother of your fantasies doesn't mean she can't be a, supervised and with carefully chosen activities, grandmother.  If you want the relationship to be a positive for your child (if that's possible, which isn't guaranteed) it sounds like short, infrequent visits with some other activity going on will be the thing to do.  We'd love to see you!  Let's meet at the park for an hour before nap time.  Of course we can get together!  Let's meet at child-friendly place with a play area for lunch.

I think it depends on the situation. One of my cousins got married in Mexico and before she planned everything she asked every person they "had to have" before deciding. Everyone she would have been devastated if they missed it said they'd go. And then after that, you have to be aware that a destination wedding does mean that less people will go.

Generally it sorts itself out, and most times if you asked me I wouldn't be able to tell  you which way it was riding without thinking about it. It's amazing how much it can move about by itself.

That said, there are times when it makes its presence known and tries to take up more room than is currently allocated to it. At that point we all have to reach down and try to causally rearrange things. 99% of time it's simple, but every now and then it's backed itself into some corner and it takes a concerted effort to straighten everything out.

I won't even get started on my laundry list of drugs ingested, but I will tell you about my weed addiction. It's so fucking stupid, I just can't control myself with it. If there's weed in the room and I'm not high, I'm smoking that shit. When I run out, I'm fine, especially after a day or two I start to enjoy sobriety again. 

I buy a half o of mid and then I'm useless for a week because I can't just have fucking weed in my room and smoke it once a day. No I have to smoke every fucking hour. I do anything to justify the next bowl until I'm out of weed.

I'm not sure but Charles Manson and Right Said Fred come to mind..
I was in Newport, Rhode Island, for a few days.  Trying to find my way around I would ask directions from locals.  Judging from the way everyone used "Thaims" Street (rhymes with "Aims") as a reference when giving directions it must have been well known but buggered if I could find it.

Eventually I asked someone where the hell this street was.  He just looked at me oddly and glanced up at the nearest street sign.  It said "Thames Street".

For those who don't know, the most well-known Thames is the river that runs through London, England.  It's actually pronounced "Tems".  Until I encountered the good folks of Newport I thought all English-speakers in the world used that pronunciation.

EDIT: When I told the Aussie guy I was with about the weird pronunciation he laughed and wondered what the locals would make of "Edinburgh".  Coincidentally, a day later we heard a couple of locals talking about Scotland.  They pronounced it "eed-en-burg" (first syllable with a long "ee") rather than the proper "ed-in-bu-ra" (first syllable with a short "e" like Mr Ed, and the "burgh" split into two syllables).
It's interesting though because the larger the following the greater parity the UFC fighter has when it comes to contract negotiations. Social media support is the most tangible way that fans can get their favorite fighters more money, aside from buying shit directly from the fighters' websites.
Yeah, not every character can do that. Easy one that comes to mind is T Hawk. You have to burn three bars just to land his ultra 1 after a hit, or three bars on only a small amount of the cast in order to connect his ultra 2.

I appreciate that you were banned and yet still visit and post here. Before The Internet, Reddit, and this sub I was sensitive about people's responses. I truly cared, and if I was given grief I would be sore about it. I might have even stopped back to that site/channel/sub/ect.

The Dark Tower books, by Steven King.
Regardless of if the game has a net gain on players, cheating also drives players away.  The only metric that is relevant is the ratio of cheaters to players quitting due to them.  

If the lost profit from quitting players due to cheaters is greater than the additional revenue gained by selling cheater accounts then valve has received a lose due to cheaters.

That is why reports are that Donald has to be at every meeting, even when he should have better things to do.  No one will show up and leave his presence because they are afraid of what someone else will get him to do.
The reason why I strongly support this theory is simply because of the massive amounts of respect Oda has for the creator of Naruto (forget his name ;;) and vice versa. So it wouldn't surprise me if Oda used an element of "communicating with your inner demon" like Naruto did with Kyuubi

I'd agree with /u/CaptainCrackbaby and /u/Paganator and say that it's at least *partially* the fault of the reading lists. 

I'm a reader, and have been my entire life, but can say with a great deal of confidence that if I'd only been exposed to novels through school I'd have never taken up reading with the passion I have for it now. Most of the reading I was ever *assigned* to do was some drek with a heavy-handed obvious **MESSAGE TO THE CHILDREN** that I'd either figured out three sentences in (if not from the title itself), or simply ignored. 

I firmly believe that young men will lap up literature that's handed to them, as long as it's not either (a) utter shit or (b) boring. I can bring up an anecdote to reinforce this position somewhat. A few years ago I was a member of the Canadian Army Reserves, instructing a basic training course. The overwhelming majority of my students were males around 17 or 18 years old (essentially, nearing high school graduation). Towards the end of training we had a couple range days for their final confirmation shoots. As NCO for the ammo &amp; working parties I had to designate a few sentries in shifts, essentially someone to sit at the range gate raising the gate for any visitors (of which there would be none) and trying not to fall asleep in a little shack. Generally, you'd never find a volunteer for that job as they'd rather be handling ammunition &amp; loading magazines because bullets are shiny and they'd rather do that. I'd brought my copy of Heinlein's *Starship Troopers* to the range that day as I figured I might be bored myself in the downtime. I handed it off to the first Private heading out to that dingy little shack to try and keep him awake, with the instructions to pass it on to the next soldier that went there and to make sure I got that book back at the end of the second day. 

Little bastards were practically queuing up to volunteer for the job after that. Long story short: yeah, high school males will read enthusiastically *if* they're given something they like.

[Day 29](https://flic.kr/p/DyiYMB) off to college!
F*ck having an "ideal weight"
F*ck whatever you're classified by the "BMI" (which is pointless) 

Be at a point in what you're happiest in the mirror and how you feel about yourself day to day.
He was in his late thirties.
Hopefully never.
That would burn off after one round (if you mean in the barrels).  And if you mean in the air, that's not what vapor trails look like at all (they look like point-sourced mirages, and you have to be *right* behind the bullet to see it.  This is flat-out smoke.)
[removed]
I bet a wet saw with diamond blade would be adequate then.
//I've said this before on sodahead, I dated a guy who basically was into vampirism and they were well meaning but, very obsessive because he would constantly text me and call me. It got to the point where I called it quits. I almost forgot, he looked like George Harrison. 😆
Pufferfish are one of the smarter fish.  Plus they do have emotions.
So bray needs jinder to win.......
Still waiting on you to engage in a discussion btw
No you're stupid and so are most people here.
That's a horribly cynical and misogynistic view of women. You really should address this with a therapist if you ever hope to have a healthy,  fulfilling relationship. I'm serious dude.  I'm not judging, just ~~getting~~ trying to help.  

Edit: typo
It's not designed to be used that way, thats why its hard to do.
The lvl 80 boost will equip you with class suitable armor, though idk if it is viable with elite spec.

30 is kinda okay, I guess. Make sure you read the little info bars when you level up.

Or its like shooting a tank with a pistol.
Government destroyed and reformed.... 

sounds like what we need here in the US.
Since Joon 2015
&gt; If it was fun, you'd still be doing it even with lesser rewards

The idea of it wasn't supposed to be about being fun.  It was about making a decent income to afford the expensive shit in the game.
ok
why was andy letting him constantly interupt and why were the other housewives answering that POS?
Read my comment again. I don't really know what you're talking about.
My business is not a separate entity from myself. its registered in BC with a GST number.(I currently live in Canada)

So right now whatever is left over after taxes and expenses directly becomes my wage.
The people who put men on the moon drew from hundreds of years of physics, rocketry, biology, anatomy, engineering, textiles, etc. to do it. It wasn't done in twelve years.

Maybe she was just 'picked up for questioning' like everyone else who was an Avery.
Come on, that one was a 7/10 at least.


Provided we're all talking about the same episode here.
Yeah, it wasn't outstanding as far as Who goes, but it had some clever twists and an even better moral quandry/hard look at humanity. The only real problem I can raise is how the creature that came out of the moon-egg laid a new moon-egg so quickly that tides weren't even slightly affected (that we could see, and they were right by a beach so it should've been obvious) by the absence of the moon.
Yes. Every nation needs a P-47D.
Dude thank you so much

Speak for your fucking self.
You don't have to stay single, just don't sign on the dotted line. ;)
I'm going to third this since I've been trying to ask this girl out for months. Really holding me back. This guy is a role model lol
There's probably an engine difference due to differing hardware but idk how to compare it
Dunno. Glad they're doing it, though.
Not to mention Death to the False Emperor on a 5+ and the noise marine ability to shoot right before dieing.


Thats a LOT of free attacks at odd times. Theyre going to throw off your opponents tempo like crazy.
Christmas acting like they've all been attacked by Jody? Like they stopped being a majority threat after 1 day in the house.
CRV doesn't get love on reddit but it's a reliable SUV. The redesign is very nice with the new engine and CarPlay. Also, the Honda sensing is a nice addition.
Don't do that dude, lol.
Thank you! You're right, and I look forward to feeling this way again.
&gt;What's with the authority defense force in this thread, is physical removal brigading or something?

No but people a getting tired of far leftists infecting everything.
Incidentally - speaking of sales reps - Bambino needs to let up on their 'compulsory sales rep' thing. They might do better.
As far as I can tell, they are still up and running.
Explains their insane internet connectivity, they are all drunk, introverted and on Reddit.
Wut?
You'd prefer that internet service providers abuse their control of the internet without constraint?

That's what you're arguing for, you do realize that?
The best time I had last semester doing school stuff was turning physics homework into a drinking game at the library. Get a webassign question correct? Shot. Another one? Another shot. You hit your zone fast and then it gets fun.
"I know right... heh... c'mon, let's get you some food, after... after whatever the hell that was." *snrk*
The U.S. has a giant elephant in the room - The National Debt.

Both parties do not want to be the ones that tell all their citizens:

"you know all those programs we have that is making us billions in debt every day"

"yea"

"we going to remove them"

insert political suicide. 

I wish we had a partisan agreement or something to lower our debt.
You just have to commit. Dont be afraid to pull it *way* too far, it's the only way to learn. Once you loop out a few times you'll realize it's not so bad. 

Also it has nothing to do with your fork, it's all technique  

Tl,dr: just fuckin send it
I dont have the time right now to go through all of the games but from what I look at right now it seems like you die alot, so you probably have some positioning problems you could work on. If you are serious about getting better I always recommend going over replays to see areas in which you could improve. Also loss streaks happen to everyone I recently just got over a 500 mmr loss streak.
His middle is getting kinda...sawft.

Do you still have any left?
Not back when you could pick up and start a [homestead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts). Up until [1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts#End_of_homesteading) in the US, if you wanted to build a log cabin on public land somewhere, you could pay a filing fee and the land would be yours.
Yup a two bedroom house with a one car garage where I'm from costs around 60-70k
I hate liberals that dont accept Trump is their president, get over it, conservatives dealt with someone they didnt like for 8 years
I'm starting to question if what I'm actually seeing are actually shadow people because, while looking at the "shadows" themselves, I've started to notice that they seem more like remnants left over from something else, like a while ago while I was at work, a friend of mine, who is also sensitive, said that there were some entities behind us, so I flashed and saw three golden figures standing together.  A little while later, I flashed the same area where they had been standing, and instead of the golden figures, I saw, in the same shape as the figures, a gray area similar to that of the "shadow" figures that I had been seeing.  My current theory is that I'm actually seeing remnants or finger prints left over from entities.  That being said, I have seen some pretty dark, misty figures that don't stick around for long, like one time I was followed around by a particularly dark entity for about a month, but I wasn't too concerned about it because at the same time, along with the silver entity, there was a golden entity following me around at the exact same time as it.  During one experience when I was trying to flash the three entities while I was at my computer, I couldn't see anything, which I found odd because in nearly every flash during that month every day I had seen all three of them somewhere around me, even in my room.  However, during this one instance something was odd, so I stood up (it is sometimes easier for me to get a good flash when I'm standing up and not looking at anything in particular) and flashed.  I saw that where I had been previously sitting there was the dark figure standing, and on the opposite side of me there was the golden and silver entity.  I guess my flash was being blocked by the shadow figure, but I'm not a hundred percent sure so my other theory is that the silver entity was purposefully blocking my flash to keep me out of trouble.  My reaction to finding these three entities in my room and the particularly dark one being where I previously was sitting was to confront the dark entity because I was kind of sick of it following me around all the time and generally creeping me out.  So, I decided to confront it.  I told it to leave and flashed to see if it had left.  It didn't, so, while being really freaked out at that point, I asked the golden and silver entities if they could help me get it to leave my room.  I told it leave again and stood there for another 10 minutes before I did a flash again.  Didn't see anything: no dark entity, no silver, and no gold.  I moved into a different room and flashed again: still nothing.  Moved back towards computer: still nothing.  Tried again the next day and just saw the silver entity and the occasional remnant (that is what I'm assuming they are right now since it seems most of them don't even acknowledge me).  Every so often after that the golden one would visit me, and the dark entities were pretty rare for me to see, but don't stick around it seems.
You clearly havent played it. Feels like youre flying ufos and hp bars just dont work well with air combat.
Two of my brothers were sitting in a couch. One of them had to buy something online... but his credit card was in the next room. He asks the other guy if he'll get it for him. But alas, they were both too lazy. The other guy hands him his own credit card and tells him to just transfer the money to his account, which he can do on the computer. No one left the couch that day.
okay, anyone wanna make a waiver deal? literally anyone with a bullpen who isn't the white sox will do
Just to give you some rough ideas:

[This is the build i currently use](http://warframe-builder.com/Warframes/Builder/Oberon/t_30_3204020430_2-7-10-4-2-5-5-4-5-34-8-5-55-0-5-59-6-3-411-1-10-479-5-10-615-9-5-762-3-10_55-6-411-8-4-9-762-8-5-9-479-7-59-9-2-6-34-14-615-9_0/en/1-0-15)

You need the Duration and effeciency mods to sustain renewal, you could make some soft changes there but when you play with a team it can get super expensive.

You could exchange (p) Vigor for Steel Fiber wich is a bit stronger, but the moment you aktivate Iron Renewal (p) Vigor is better because the bonus armor scales better with the higher HP pool.

Or you could use Health Conversion wich is mathmaticly the best option as long you have atleast **one** stack, wich is theoraticly possible but in the end you're not really able to kill the enemies at higher level with his Reckoning.

Since you're asking for highest EHP i assume you just wanna survive much and to survive much you should utelize his abilities. He has suprsingly much CC, his smite knock downs and procs [Puncture](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_2.0/Puncture_Damage) reliable, Hollowed ground protects you from Procs -looking at slahs- and keep in mind any form of CC is coded as Status - additonaly it protecs you from Energy drain auras, Reckoning knocks enemies down and hte Blind even if its short is super effective when you primarily use melee weapons. This all can increase your survivebility immensely, this is why you should use rage and here the high efficiency helps too because you can spam without thinking too much of your energy pool.

What i wanna say is that just focusing on getting the highest possible EHP isn't that good. He has suprisingly much utility and can proc status almost as good as Saryn who is recommended when you wanna use weapons with conditoin overload + oberon has the blind and a bit more health regen and armor.

This is maby not what you're looking for but this build is pretty solid just adjust it until you like it. There're more than enough posts/videos wich showcase some oberon builds, just get some inspiration and start modding.

Standard English would either be "My car needs to be washed" or "My car needs washing". Your dialect is unusual in the grand scheme of things.
Wouldn't everyone's be zero as long as they're still alive?
Lol, it was. I kinda didn't understand why they needed it, you can't communicate with your crew deceptively (think Kirk in Wrath of Khan, or Picard sending a text in Nemesis) if your adversary can see everything you're doing.
Actually just checked my junk and it's there lol
Don't broadcast your strategy when you play comp then.

Hive had it with these puns.
I source it from a couple of friends who work at a machine shop, an HVAC fabricator, and a mechanic shop.

Try asking around to your social circle. You'd be surprised what people will donate to you if you give them a chance to help melt it all.  

If all that fails go ask a local scrap yard how much they would sell scrap aluminum to you for.
4*s - Juggs, Magik, Hulk, Colossus, &amp; Thor = 35% crit rate, 25% crit damage, 12% health. Sub out either Hulk, Thor, or Magik with anyone else and it's still at least 28% crit rate.
The poor usually are against things like welfare and social services, which Democrats support.
made it through the day! no window eating. a close call on the way home. dealing with a significant amount of stress, but didn't use fast food as a coping mechanism! did go to the market and on way home ate a breadstick from one of the bags, but I'll let that slide this time (-:
Don't be a dick. What kind of extortion do you think is going to happen here? The vast majority of people who find a phone will have zero ability to get into the contents of the phone if you have a passcode or fingerprint. What threat do they have? Not giving your phone back? If you're in an area where the police will pay attention to things like this, it'll be easy for them to find the person because you (most likely) can find the location of your phone online from your service provider.
I'm literally giving you evidence where they say they are left.  They also called for the death of McCain.  Thus, people on the left called for the death of McCain, end of story.
Didn't know people considered 50 Shades good, for god's sake, keep E.L. James away from any sort of pencil whatsoever!
I couldn't be asked to list off every one on either side that I know, but I did grow up playing Pokemon, so I'd have an easier time listing off everything up to Gen3. 

SMT, for me, I usually think of the beginning demons in any of the games. Devil Survivor had Bilwis, Kobold, Pixie, Toubyou, the weird cat thing with Animal Leg... Stuff like that. 

It's a bit different for stuff you just grew up with. Every now and then I just get weird flashbacks to my Ragnarok Online days, Fire Walking Anatolians east of Comodo to level my Sage. Memories are strange.
You can make you own sleeping quilt fairly cheap if you or your wife own a sewing machine and a big enough space to lay out the material. I spent 50 bucks on materials aside from down, and you can get 800F down for $109 a lb. a Lb of down would keep you toasty beyond your current bag I'd imagine.  Do you need an inflatable mattress? A Thermarest Ridge Rest Zlite Sol weighs 14oz and costs 44 bucks. If you can make your own quilt, you can make a much lighter Silnylon tarp.  Making your own gear isn't for everyone but I've been very much enjoying it.
Unfortunately, what I believe all this is, is WWE prepping Braun to face Brock (whenever that may be) which is just prepping Brock to look like an even bigger monster for Roman to go over.

I hope that isn't the case, but it seems that way.
You ever been to Australia?  The spiders are big AF and twice as deadly.
We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

&gt; The colored pages were definitely a nice touch

They used the digital raws this week and those colour pages are apparently official ones, I feel its kinda pointless to include them in the flow of the chapter as it interrupts the flow of the chapter

TBH I honestly don't get how some shows can get sponsored for 300+ episodes and others get 12...
Oh my god yes I watched that and left the room in the tears
oh thank you! i will definitely utilize the guild system.
That article implies that they would fire Roman for doing something like that

lol
This board is gonna be like if all the water evaporated from the ocean after that match.
They are the minority, and also, a bad Mccree/Rein/Mercy is by far more useful than a bad Widow/Hanzo/Torb, just think about that.
I refuse to believe any models about life and the universe. What if natural selection doesn't work the way we think and life is actually manufactured by beings too small to see?

Time for DELETION
*As Paxton fell, he once again lost visual contact with his partner.  The only thing he was privy to was the movement of the robot "saving" it's limb and the turret training itself on him once more.  Becoming riddled with holes once more wasn't something he wanted to be accustomed to so he resorted stretching his arm out towards the ground and grabbing hold.*

*When he felt the a "tug", he pulled himself back towards the robot and under it as the spot he recently occupied was filled with a hail of bullets.  As he rocketed towards the ground, he primed the hand with a charged impact dial in it and struck at the side of the knee he'd managed to hit twice before.*

**IMPACT!**

*His bones, even though indestructible, rattled in his arm and his muscles strained from the concussive force, but it'd be worth it if the blow did lasting damage.*

My father who is on Medicare had gap insurance for the past four yrs. he is not in  great health but not as bad as some. He was paying $157.00 month this past years (over $1800 yr) he added up what it saved him and it came out to be under $500) so he canceled it this year (it went up $37 a mth) my mother has never had it and is on Medicare as well.

I like to view everything from a historical point of view...

Federation:

The Genesis of Human Interstellar Civilization who formed as a pseudo United Nations to protect interests abroad from Sol. Unfortunately, they're a mega corporation in my eyes and seem to fit the 'Mericun Freedom stereotype far to well sometimes. I left them after I earned my permit to access our homeland. 

Empire:

I really, really, REALLY, *REALLY* don't like them. I don't like their ships, I don't like their political leanings, even their history is based on Genocide and warring with Walmar- I mean Tesc- I mean the Federation. They began as a colonial interest who tried to escape the grasp of the Feds if I recall correctly. I like their indentured servitude policy but I just can't stand all these dirty basking Imperial scum who think their glorified Iphone with a Frame shift drive duct taped to it is any better than my good old fashioned Ferdie. I do like the monarchy though, if only they didn't have any power and were just a ceremonial figure like the Old Earth Queen Elizabeth the II of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Alliance:

Ah, now these are the guys I can get behind. They began from the ashes of a war between the Federation and the Imperials IIRC. Now they're a beacon of neutrality against the Grand Star War of Walmart and North Korea. I honestly wish they had a proper standing Navy. I remember oogling over some fan art of what an Alliance Capital Ship could look like and I wish they were an actual superpower rather than the modern day equivalent of the European Union (In some respects, even the EU might be a bit stronger than the Alliance)

Pirates:

You know, if you're a gentleman or lady Pirate who makes his demands first before he shoots me as I'm high waking the fuck out of there, you're alright by my book :) I'll give you some cargo if I can't blast your fucking brains out, you definitely deserve it for making these conflicts a lot smoother!

Thargoids:

404: Not found

Edit: I should also mention, the majority of Humanity in Elite lives in a very abject poverty! From what I've noticed, we're incredibly rich and lucky to be able to fly around the bubble doing the things we do! I like to think that all of us are actually just moisture farmers from Tatooine who made enough money from Grandpappy's will that we can now afford a Sidewinder and can try to escape. We are way to powerful to be commoners, we can single handedly alter the economies of entire star systems, we can plunge places into war, we can single handedly starve people to famine by not delivering those landmines in the name of freedom.

Similar thing happened to my wife.  First, the doctor didn't process the insurance claim correctly and tried billing us for it.  Next, after the insurance was cleared up, he tried billing her for what they didn't pay (they always overbill insurance, insurance pays what they pay, and that's usually it).  Had to have insurance tell him TWICE to cut the shit and stop billing us for the $3600.

I have been worked as waiter in a cafe&amp;bar while I was student in University about 17 years ago. I needed cash for my studies and it was my first job. I have grown up in a very little town and there weren't even cafes there. I had even no idea what was tip. I knew it only from movies but I wasn't thinking that it's something regular.

I was poor but proud guy. :D And my father was keep telling me "you won't accept anything (especially cash) from people if it's not a family member. Don't do things which will embarrass you and our family" Hahah. I bet you'd guess what happened... 

Second day of my work someone came to cafe and tried to gave me some cash. I thought it's kinda insult. I was like &gt;:| However I just told him "No, thanks". He told me "Oh man, just take it".  Told him "I already gain enough money here. ". He tried to put the cash in my apron's pocket and this time I told him angrily "I don't want your money!" and I moved away. However he was insulted, I saw that in his face. It has turned to red. He went to near of boss and talked him about me. My boss was an old and complaining man. Heh.

Boss called me "Why did you reject the tip". I told him "I am not a beggar". He thwapped me hard a few times first and then he taught me how things work.

Tips are generally 10% of the bill in Turkey. At the least that's what I give for the tip.

&gt;  Docs put me on antidepressants and Lamotrigine they help but they also make benzos less effective, making me have to take more to get the wanted effect

that is your problem. Wanting to quit without wanting to stop the feeling benzos give you. You need to start taking less but at a very slow rate. Some of my old pals use to be hooked on benzos bad. Like 10mg of Xanax a day and 20-30mg of etiz a day. Went to the doctor and told them what they were doing and they need help. Doc gave them anti-seizure medicine. I don't think the doc will give you any kind of weaker benzos bc they already know you are addicted and will most likely abuse.

Look up "Benzo Taper Guides" and find one that fits your needs. Take it slow. I think the recommended taoer is to cut back like .5mg every week or so but I'm no doctor. 

Also, it's going to suck ass. Might even feel like youre dying or some shit. As fas as the adderall goes, don't. Will only increase your anxiety level.

By experience, that water filtration here in Manila isn't as clean as those in the States. Yes there has been progress for Maynilad to clean this mess up but we can't regulate every water source here. So it is practical for us to suggest them to ONLY drink bottled water. They won't like you anymore if you asked them to drink tap water. Our bodies can handle it but theirs can't as what /u/gatdulapascual has explained.

Even though I'm Filipino too my mom doesn't want me to go drink tap water out of nowhere.

See I understand your point, I just really doubt the motivation. This is not some murky little understood phenomenon. You don't need to be playing at a footy club to realise homophobia still exists. 

Literally nobody is pretending homophobia is extinct. They may insinuate we should be better than that, but that is not the same thing. The fact footy is traditionally a boys' club and not easily overturned, is something well understood, hence the league's focus on women's involvement, broader community involvement, and the general talk of homosexuality etc.

So if everyone understands the problem, and he isn't offering a solution, then that raises the obvious question; why speak on this in the first place? Well we all know he loves the sound of his own voice, so that's a good starting point in answering that question.

Pro Domme here and in my 15 years of working in LA, SF and NY, I have NEVER had a request for a professional Dom or even male switch. I think you could certainly do gay for pay Domming men. I know it's a hang up but here's the deal: 

When I said I've never had a request for a male, this actually isn't true - I HAVE had a request but you see, it's all in FANTASY. Once I have arranged for the male, they chicken out. This has happened 100% of the time. Every single one has backed out. 

As far as women paying for a male dom, it's sort of like male prostitution. There's just a million guys to meet who can do this. A lot of super talented guys who are older. 

Where you come in is some rich guys stud or bull (as mentioned above) to fuck his wife in front of him. I would personally use your service for my own fun in my personal life but at the same time, I happen to know many handfuls of more qualified men who will do it for free and not put me or my partner at risk.

It takes MANY years to be a good dom and navigate the emotional realm that comes with this type of play. You have to protect yourself emotionally as well. It WILL change you if you're not very emotionally grounded. 

I wish you only the best of luck. Feel free to PM me.

&gt; Oh, no, no he's not. But I'm sort of issue and sometimes I think he hates me and instead of calmly telling a person that, I go all on a ranting spree and I get reaaallly mean. I think he's lying about this or that and I make up stories for a bit.

I think everyone can agree his fire/ice/lightning/toxin breath could use tweaking.  But that's where I have to stop agreeing with you.  I use Ice almost all the time, and it works great for his armour buffs.

Elemental Ward gives a lot of bonus armour (to everyone not super squishy), which makes him a seriously hard to kill frame, and reflects damage while also occasionally chilling targets.  This is so great for his survivability.  With Oberon's ability to grant base armour to others indefinitely now, this elemental ward bonus to others can make squishy frames into bruisers.

Vexing Armour is the main reason I play him.  It *only affects him*, but it's his Determinator skill.  It makes his armour reach *ridiculous* heights, allowing you to shrug off even juggernaut attacks (if you can get a heal.  Lookin' at you Oberon rework).  Meanwhile if your shields do drop, or even if you take toxic damage from various infested sources, you gain bonus damage very quickly and can thin out mobs super fast with even lackluster weapons.

I like his turret pelt/Effigy as well.  In all but the highest of high level content it does a considerable amount of damage, disrupts enemies with its roars, and does a decent job of area control/denial.  It is by no means a set and forget trap to wtfpwn all contenders, it won't keep an interception node clear of hackers (if there are enough bodies for it to aim at before hitting the hacker), but it's a very solid assist.

*****
&gt; Emmanuel Macron&amp;#039;s lead over Marine Le Pen has slipped six points since polls conducted just before the first round last Sunday.

&gt; However he is still as much as 20 points ahead. According to pollster Harris Interactive, who correctly predicted the result of the first round with remarkable accuracy, Mr Macron now has a lead of 61% against Ms Le Pen&amp;#039;s 39%. :: Marine Le Pen: Who is National Front candidate in France election?

&gt; In the first round of voting last Sunday, Mr Macron secured 23.75% of the vote compared to Ms Le Pen&amp;#039;s 21.53%. Given that half of voters didn&amp;#039;t choose either Ms Le Pen or Mr Macron, big question in this final week is which way will they all vote? Polling has revealed some surprising trends.

Used it a while ago and hated it. 

Considering pre-nerf Strun Wraith has a 1.5 second reload for an entire magazine, it's not that much different than reloading 2 shells at once. 

If they want to keep this new mechanic, reload time needs to be drastically reduced. I'm talking about 0.15-0.2 seconds per shell. The Strun Wraith was designed to be a status machine, much like the Boar Prime, yet DE decided to cripple their roles in favor of making the Hek and Tigris the new gods of the meta.

Also, I just saw that you've talked everyday for 30 days, if he's been there for about a month and is there for alcohol or benzos he's going to have to go through something called Post Acute Withdrawal which typically hits you around a month after your last drink/drug so it's possible he doesn't feel well. It's brutal, I've dealt with it myself. Try to just take it easy for now.

With an ATK +30%/50% boost you can make them deal big damage. RS is less of an issue when an ATK+50% boost lets you hit the softcap, or as close to it as possible anyway. And every hit counts - it's why Ramza is such a top-tier support.

Riot/LoL are kings of greed. Their game is so un-fucking-balanced if you don't have *everything* unlocked. That means you need *all champions* and you need at least *3 rune pages* in order to be semi-competitive. Multiplayer games are supposed to be about competition. That legitimately takes about 1000 hours nowadays. 

Riot are the kings of bait and switch and they have been since the game left beta. LoL is an absolutely terrible game now, and always will be because of that model they use. 

Dota doesn't put up with that stupid ass shit. Dota is what you play if you like complex mobas without pay2skipgrind and more balance.

&gt; However, it seems that most languages do not have unambiguous grammars.

Algol 60, C, C++, and Lua is a pretty small sample.

&gt; Do you think it is worthwhile for a language to have an unambiguous grammar?

Personally, for my current language project, I've chosen to use a context-free grammar that is unambiguous and can be parsed with an LL(1) (predictive) parser. I like it because it's so easy to specify and implement and because it's beginner-friendly.

I also learned from Wirth's writing (hence, minimalism) and grew up with Scheme (so prefix syntax feels natural to me).

It's seems like the right default unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, right?

For our first date, my (now) husband showed up in a suit and he had roses for me.  And, not the cheap grocery store roses, he went to a florist.  We went to a trendy steakhouse and he let me choose the bottle of wine.  Then, he asked me what I would like to order, I told him.  When the server came back he ordered for me.  THEN, it gets better.  A few streets down was one of my favorite stores, he took me there and told me to pick something out.  I was like, no, no, but he insisted.  I just couldn't, so he finally picked out a purse for me.  He drove me home, walked me to my door, kissed me, and said goodnight.
Please correct me if I am wrong, but weren't there a few states that voted for Obama twice and then switched to Trump?
TL;DW:

1. Due to the way the physics of the game work, the game wants to move Mario, but it wants him to stay out of the ceiling more, so he doesn't move.

2. Also due to the physics of the game, being in water and on a slope at the same time causes your speed to build up. There is no upper limit on this because the games expects you to slip back into the water seconds after this process begins. 

3. By combining these facts, in certain places, any speed is possible, though it takes a while to build up to it.

4. When Mario goes to move, the game checks where his next position will be, given his speed and direction. If the next  position is inside a wall, it stops him. If the next position would be far enough, Mario can go through the wall, allowing him to, in effect, teleport.

5. The way the game handles collisions creates a sort of 'loop'. For example, imagine a chessboard. Call the bottom left square 'a1'. The squares bordering a1 are a2 above it, b2 diagonal from it, and b1 to the right of it. Now imagine a King piece moving along that bottom row. It moves from a1 to b1, then to c1, and so on until it reaches h1. Now there's no more board, so what happens if it moved to the right again? In Mario 64 physics, the collision detection loops back around to the other side, in this case back to square a1. Because there's a board to support the king at square a1, the king hovers in the air just to the right of the board. In the game, what this means is that if you go a certain distance away from any point in a level, the game will react as though you landed int he same place yo started because the collision detection loops.

6. Because this collision detection keeps looping, and due to a few quirks in the way things are calculated, it's easier to plan your movements in distances of 4x[the distance discussed in 5]. To use the chessboard analogy, it's like moving 32 squares at a time instead of just 8.

7. You don't however, have to go to exactly the same spot you left. You can jump to different parts of the level by carefully modulating your speed. Thus, this type of run plans out routes, using various slopes in the level to allow Mario's speed to drop while still maintaining the circumstances that allow him to launch. By launching int he right direction with the right speed, it's possible to keep looping the collision detection around so that Mario ends up right at the star's position without having to actually jump.

EDIT:

8. Going up a slope requires more speed than going along a flat plane. De facto speed refers tot he amount of speed you actually need to have once you've factored in the relative heights of your start and end points.

You didn't even spell it correctly. It's not that surprising that it gets mispronounced since it doesn't phonetically follow English rules. "ch" in English doesn't have a "k" sound, not to mention pronouncing the ending "e".

The question arises did humans ever live in present? The early man's survivalistic instinct was in a sense future planning. While evolution did sugarcoat survival with complex political economy, every move in present is in anticipation of some outcome which in itself contradicts living in present. To stretch the point (I think) the mainstreaming of science did play a part in reshaping narrative into a more cause-effect phenomenon. Also as more we evolve "time" becomes significant variable in equation of life. The flowing nature of time and living in present is janus faced.

Chrono (mesmer) is probably the most high demand/low supply class in PvE, followed by Condi PS warrior. Druids are also high in demand, but you can find them anywhere these days. These first three classes are considered support classes; chrono is damage/utility support through Quickness (makes actions faster) and Alacrity (makes cooldowns go faster), condi ps warrior offensive support through Might, banners and Empower Allies and druids both defensive and offensive support through heals, spirits, pet skills, Spotter and Grace of the Land. Other classes are in pretty equal spots (except for revenant).

But everything is tied to the oil economy, including the infrastructure. Most pesticides are derived from oil, without it a single outbreak of disease or pest would destroy the harvest. You can resort to alternative copper and sulfur based pesticide, but you need to use ten times as much with them - and you'll need to carry them to the farm with a crippled transportation system. Than there's the mining and manufacturing operation for the copper and sulfur, another stranglehold once crude dries up. It adds up once you include other things.  

And you're forgetting that synthetic fertilizers allow one crucial thing: the constant replenishment of soil nutrient. Without that that, farm land quickly becomes depleted in fertility within a few years. Before, farmers would use crop rotation to replenish the soil, leaving a quarter of the land to fallow unplanted. Taken in extreme, that's 25% of your yield gone right there. Corn/soybean rotation is practiced today, but these farmers still depend on fertilizers to replenish the soil. Yes, you can use manure, but people have been using manure, both human and animal, for millennia. Not to mention, the livestock producing the manure depend on the same fertilizer-intensive crops for their feed. America's huge cattle population would be curbed massively, along with the manure supply.

There was a passage in Max Brook's "Word War Z" where it outlines that after the collapse of the global economy, all the parks and sport fields in large cities had to be converted into community gardens in order to supplement the reduced food supply. I think a lot of that would be going on in places like the US or Europe, seeing how most of what we refer to as our suburbia covers up what use to be prime farmland before the advent of the automobile and cheap gas made far-flung suburbs a feasible reality.

Well the mod event said 250k people died from starvation so you are wrong.
There's a couple pictures where you can see the shot string before it it hits the birds. The pictures that has white or black spots in them is where you can see the pellets. There is a picture of a goose where you can see the pellets then the next picture is of the goose folded up after getting hit. Those were back to back pictures from the burst mode out of the camera. I thought it was bad ass 

Most of the ones where you can see the shot stream resulted in a kill, but not all of them. These picts were the absolute best out of the 1,000 plus i took. Check me out on Instagram (m_stagner), I'll be posting a whole lot of recently edited pictures from this season

Huff huff huff okie doke

Edit there always is more vanilla though ....
Ugh, don't remind me.  I'll be on the toilet until my phone runs out of charge every time after SMBF releases.
You don't need Bull's Strength if you use Animal Focus. Also your trip should be at +32. The size modifier goes from -2 on the bite to +2 on the trip, a differential of +4.
I don't like the spotlight being on part timers over full timers but I love how much he has Vince by the balls. Only guy with the leverage and little amount of fucks to give to be able to really stand up for himself and not get fucked over in his contract at all, fair play to him
That's some hella fast Internet.
Thank you!! You've saved a life haha
I researched dish washers and found some recommended brands, stores around here that sell them, and compared the prices. No decision yet, but the research part is done, yay!
Too much shucky ducky.
Don'. the game has gone to the trash with tier 8 premiums and a fucked mm. It is literally no fun.

Only thing worth a damn is the ACOG. But that Jam-O-Matic sure is pretty to look at.
I think the issue is less about whether St. Peter was the prince of the apostles or not, but rather about it being a true relationship of leadership over the apostles rather than him being given the most prerogatives (let us not forget that traditionally, it was Peter, James, John and Paul who were considered the greatest apostles, to the point that the epistles following Acts begin with theirs), and most importantly, whether the Pope of Rome automatically and always acts in the person of Peter, or whether that is rather an ideal to attain (as when St. Pope Leo wrote his dogmatic tome).
&gt; The thing about an improved image among the alt-right, fascists, populists and China is that these people don't care either. Sure, they might cheer him on but they don't actually care about him. 

Yeah, this exactly.

China just pretends to like him to keep the little game going, but they still don't respect Philippine sovereignty, it's not like they're going to give Scarborough Shoal back to us just because Duterte kisses their asses or anything.
That's the kiddie pool option. It did have some teething problems.
If you say so. Art isn't for the feint of heart. If you don't want to hear the worst along with the best, keep your art to yourself.
No I shot faster.
Thank you.

That was today?!  Awesome!

&gt;  Tilda Swinton is cast as a Tibetan Monk; Emma Stone as a Hawaiian woman

Yeah that caused similar outrage.
Yeah, it's been crazy, but that is almost to be expected after a long rehab and the intrigue of fastpass. They theoretically have a single rider line, but because fastpass is so long they often have to shut it down to make room for FP guests.
Why would he show him then threaten him like he randomly stumbled upon it?
You are correct. MM can't see the details of the match like this. If I'm not with a party I always cap home. In some matches you can certainly see the difference between a team based effort and somebody who's trying to place higher to rank up/skins.
Oh! Sure. I should have some pasta left in the fridge.

I don't. I train powerlifting 3-4 days a week. When I first started logging, I took a few weeks to dial in a deficit in which I could still train consistently and not feel too lethargic. I don't really trust my fitbit to be accurate with calorie counts, either.
I like PHX because they pick fights and bring lots of people for me to shoot. Sometimes they shoot me though. I don't like it as much when they do that.

That is all.

Doesn't he want to keep his doctor and save $2500 a year?
&gt; "if you're not happy here, we will be fine without you."

This line makes me think that if every other employer has given you opposite feedback to what these guys are giving you, it's likely that these guys are projecting psychologically. They're bad communicators, think the work is beneath them, etc.


See how many of their criticisms are things they're as guilty of or more.


Combine that with them lashing out when you try to be a good communicator and I'd start looking around for a better job.

Does jinder mahal still have the title with him? Edit: nevermind lol
You're dead right on the first one.

For the second one, what exactly do you mean?  Do you mean the Jesus Prayer ("Lord Jesus Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on me, a sinner")?  Cuz that's perfectly legit.
Sounds interesting, PM'd
Most pollsters expect a turnout similar to 2004 iirc.
Seattle Syndrome:


You are at first overwhelmed with love toward the food and architecture and fashion, even the humanitArian aid shown toward the homeless.

But you are quickly disillusioned and retreat into a cold inner shell of isolation from which you never make social or purposeful physical contact with others, and drown your self hate and "seasonal" depression with copious amounts of caffeine, usually coffee.
Did you mean salads?
Probably the Viking DNA
I bet he'll be more pliable playing on a contract value based on games and snaps played.
Don't be silly. Everyone knows men can't be raped. It's just not how that works.
I have enjoyed it so far. I'm in the minority but I like the slower pacing that doesn't have a mobile suit fight every episode, especially since the show like to show off that the suits need to be repaired, upgraded, and can't just slug it out every episode that's to a magical reset switch. I appreciate the world building and character development that the lulls give us. It also makes the fights feel like they have more weight and makes me look forward to them as a treat.

 As for beam weapons I like not having them since I am not a fan of beams in scifi in general. Projectiles and melee weapons just seam cooler to me. And the main Gundam, Barbatos, has an awesome melee weapon.

Over all IBO feels more realistic to me and that is why I have enjoyed it so far.
Lol whatever happened to that?
Imagine a team with the dank police man and the chill pilot guy... Unstoppable
3 pcc gets me....? I'm confused lol. Looking for Turbos.
Wow! Why were you given this name? How was it significant to your parents? Do you go by Breck? What is your ethnicity?

This is great, wow. Thank you.
Balik tayo dun sa sinabi ni u/rubyanjel. Yung ipahalata mo ng uti-uti na umay ka na sa mga sinasabi nila.

Pede mo gawing *whiny method* every time na banggit sila ng banggit ng expectations nila sa iyo. An 'uggh' or 'guhhhhh' sound will not sound that bad.

O pag maghapon yung ganun nila, do the *may-pulang-dalaw-ako-bad-mood-ako-ngayon* method. Yung parang lagi kang inis/galit pero semi-pretend.
Ha, joke's on you; I added you as a friend!

Assuming they actually go off-roading every mod in this picture is extremely practical.

The Red Frame Astray, the RX-178 Mk II kits and the Strike Gundam kits are considered some of the best.

Eva-01 and Wing Zero Custom are oft considered the worst.
Just about any incorrect phrase. 

For all intensive purposes/I could care less/irregardless/on accident. 

Also 'park my manners' but I don't think many people actually say that.
I suppose that's a valid point sir, I do mean I couldn't care less
I don't think I'm trolling.  I'm just trying to be the best me I can be.  Nothing more.

Depending on how that new lifespan is reached, it might mean a longer period of brain plasticity, making people take way longer to become set in their ways. Also there might be a greater incentive to be flexible and adapt, since you don't wanna risk losing out on a 200 year lifespan.
holy shit this is perfect

True that, where do you live? I can't really imagine LA being boring considering anything *I* could want is either here or nearby, but I'm curious
At the top of the thread where it says goals, DD is in place of Slepyshev's goal. Thought I was going crazy thinking it was slepy and not DD.
Managed to do this on both Edea fights. Basically just kept myself alive until I set up Raijin BSB with Shout+History's Truth+Vessel of Fate+Breaks with Cloud USB RW. Was doing about 70k per hit x 8(I think) hits. Pretty easy to do since she doesn't hit too hard if you got Wall+Shell up. This is the first 220 solo I've ever done and it was awesome to see the true fury of the Thunder God :)

I responded to the other post, thank you for your reply though. I appreciate that it's sincere, well reasoned and not simply an attempt to win the internet with a snarky one liner.

I would respond to this:

&gt; The belief in 3. without invalidating 1. and 2. is what prevents me from being an MRA; they fundamentally deny 1. And/or 2.

By saying that this is *your subjective belief* about the actions and beliefs of MRAs. If I assert that they're no more fundamentally linked to those positions than feminists are to misandrist positions, well then we're at a no true Scotsman impasse where we're both asserting that our own definition of 'label' is the accurate one. 

The difference between us is that I feel you're perfectly within your philosophical rights to reject that label. If, on the whole, you feel that the ideology or members of that group are incompatible with your worldview in whole or in part, I'll respect your wishes to distance yourself from the label.

Will you do the same for me, and allow me the agency to define my own relationship with feminism?
Vandal Savage. The dude is immortal so it'd be pretty cool to see history unfold. People are predictably unpredictable and I'd love to just see what happens. Although the downsides are possibly becoming a human guinea pig and the chance that living that long would erode my sanity.
Thanks for letting me know.

Hoping I can convince my friend to get it taken care of tomorrow.

No online voter reg in Texas is a big hurdle.
Overkill.  Most people's wrongness can be handled by mocking them.

If he was there and in a truck that had water he'd have been putting it out. Most of the time my team is first on scene of an accident.  It's not fun rushing through your squad car looking for anything that can help and just finding a shitty little fire extinguisher.

Baphomet is still the strongest tutor in the game, but Azazel combo got deleted from the game while Spawn was Control Blood's only other win condition.  Four damage is a very noticeable in a deck full of 3-4 damage finishers and now the deck is completely outclassed by Aegis.  Neutral Blood would have ran Phantom Cat anyway if only Baphomet was nerfed, so why nerf Control Blood's only remaining win condition?  Even after Control Blood turned out to be mediocre at best people were calling for it to be nerfed into the ground.

It's the slake moths, man.
Nah, I think you are just full of shit.
This was the single most toxic place on the internet during his rise to fame.  It was the home of the most brigading of brigadiest.  Manzealots were in full force.  Even now, they STILL say "well, he still had the talent, if he just didn't have all the distractions" etc.

You may have had a reasonable doubt, as did I.  But here, it was a hellhole and the great manziel wars were a disgusting time.  The sad thing is, those people who post here and make fun of me, are the same set of 5 people who were the manziel guys, and they all got to brigade to their hearts content.

As a bass player it makes me sad that there aren't too many points where the bass gets to shine on this album.
Meh, happens in a plethora of movies for guys as well. Knocked up, Superbad, She's out of my league, etc etc. Nerdy guy gets the girl

I'm going to have to look into that! I know she got put on in a while ago (doctors thought the weight gain was something pre-diabetes related, turned out to be wrong) but it had an adverse effect for her so she was told to discontinue use. But maybe there was just something about the dosage. Thanks for the tip!
Honestly, they've made the character almost unbearable to watch.
Years ago I was waiting at a set of lights waiting to turn right (we drive on the left, so this is ACROSS the traffic/like turning left for those driving on the right) and got involved in a multi-car pileup just by being stationary. 

Someone caused a smash between himself and another car going the other way and both were total write-offs and bounced off to the side and hit my &amp; another car beside me. The car beside me got pretty messed up, but would have been repairable.  
  
Of the 4 cars involved, I was the only one with ANY insurance. The guy that caused it was drunk, so his insurance was null and void. The car he first hit was a grey import skyline. The owner of which was on his way home from getting it from the importers, and *had not yet gotten insurance*. The guy beside me that got hit was uninsured and there I was, with a car lucky to be worth $1500 a dinted panel and broken indicator and the ONLY insurance of any of the vehicles.

i took the $650 cheque they cut, bought a $5 indicator from a wrecker and spent the remaining $645 on not getting my car fixed.

Just an FYI, in case you're not aware, you can set a companion party so you always have the same lead (in-game options &gt; set companion party to party of your choosing, that way the leader of that party is always your companion.)

I think stixxay has a bunch of upsides, and he's done fine for his first split. But I think it's fair to expect improvement of him, given that we often have to laneswap to avoid him getting killed in lane and randomly getting caught out. Im a big stixxay fan don't get me wrong but Im also hoping for improvement (which I expect to see. Dude has a great attitude and work ethic)
He seems to have let the green lantern hate go, he even teams up with green lanterns and shows no hostility towards them like he does with yellow lanterns.

That is just one of those stupid sayings that is wrong. "The customer is always right", "There are no atheists in foxholes" ... wrong as well. There are lots of stupid questions.

He might be talking about the area where you have to place Matchstick during the Flame of the Firehawk quest line. I didn't realise there was even an area behind the wall until I did that side quest, but it's useful considering everywhere else is huge and open and enemies can see through fire but you can't.
The thickness is great. I decided to remedy the problem by purchasing the white HHKB BT via tenso. Now I'm not wasting keycaps.
I just posted it.
There's obviously just a DXF and BOM which various low-price vendors have copied around. The vendor pays some worker (who is probably their family member) to assemble kits and ship them to westerners who buy them on Aliexpress and Banggood. These guys probably don't understand anything about 3D printing, it's just a way to make a few dollars and hope they sell enough volume to make a profit. There are still many printers which ship with "MigBot" display name on the outdated Marlin on the control board, including the Tevo Tarantula. There's probably one ancient PC running pirated Windows XP with no service packs and they just know to plug the board in and press the arrow in the ancient Arduino IDE version they're using.
He's a defensive ace who's all over third base.
&gt;but still expecting VIP services makes you an asshole.  

Exactly.  If you want a service that is well known for being a tipping service and you act like a rich entitled douche even a little and you don't tip, you can add ignorant to the list of things.  Often people I notice who don't tip are the ones on the company dime.  They ask for valet service, because the company is paying for their parking so the extra cost doesn't matter to them.  They then proceed to not tip because they can't charge it to the company...if you don't want to tip, park yourself like everyone else.    

Additionally, people I know who worked as bellmen have had to charge certain groups that would show up, a fee for using baggage carts (normally a free service provided with a bellman to load, move and unload bags but a tip is appreciated). The people would act like rich douches occupying 45 minutes of a bellman's time asking for everything they could AND then wouldn't tip after all of that.  So basically acting like super important, demanding VIP's but don't have the basic idea in your head that if you are rich and some big shot who gets a bunch of people to do your bidding when you travel, you damn well better tip, means you aren't that rich and aren't a VIP.

I know what you mean. My best friend once typed "their" instead of "they're" on one of my profile pictures once. Instantly blocked and deleted him. I haven't seen him since, either. This shit is unacceptable.
It is! A friend of mine took this a while back.

Shaved his beard and got a hair cut.
Are you where there is an organization like a chapter of the Alzheimer's association? My mother had dementia. In the early stages he took her to Dallas to a specialist for diagnosis. That was in 2002/3 or so. But the association or something like that can point you to local resources.
Everyone is different. If you feel good keep training. I had a similar regiment in high school and it worked great
Sort of trippy. Cool!
I hear songs on the radio where they don't even acknowledge the song title OR the artist. Ever. It's annoying every now and then.

I'll tell you the secret to beating Punk. I've watched many of his games - ones he won/lost and have analyzed them in depth. Please don't share this with anyone outside of here. 

There are two keys:
1. Controlling the distance
2. Well-timed counters

1- If Punk gets in on you, he will put constant pressure on you and you will eventually get caught. Many think that blocking will stop that. But his pressure is so overwhelming from many angles that it's only a matter of time till he opens you up. To counter this you have to control the distance. If you have a character who can zone (fireballs, long-range attacks), you need to use it to your advantage heavily. Don't think you can compete with him toe to toe. Zone, zone and zone hardcore. This was Du's mistake vs Punk. He kept going in on Punk thinking he can out-bully him. Nope.

2- What if you don't have a character who is strong at zoning? If this is the case, you need to be strong at countering his jabs and footsies. When you're blocking his combos there will be breaks and pauses in between each punch in a combo string. You need to time your jab to interrupt his combo string. Once you interrupt his string with your jab you can counter him with a combo of your own and pressure him. This is what Haitani did to get those 3 wins on Punk in the finals. 

Of course, all of this is easier said than done, but it's not impossible. Not anyone can beat punk. You have to the type of player to train hard and you need to train the right things.
I'm actaully glad the banner is going away. Now, I won't be tempted anymore lol.

That is a very well thought out and well written response. Unfortunately it does not fit reddit's idea of meta, so you get downvoted and the guy with the 10 word response that is basically "follow the guide don't think for yourself" gets upvoted.
Dude. What the fuck. We get it man, the knights think that it's funny to be dicks to us.

#THAT SITE IS A FUCKING WHITE MALE
I'm not saying this is the best form of government (though I don't think democracy is either). Power almost always corrupt and China only recently has started cracking down on corruption. I'm just explaining the situation and why China is the way it is.

You must understand that independent thought is great, but not when your country is in a crisis. It's analogous to Dota. You need a captain who's telling everyone what to do and they need to listen. It's why pub games are so hard to win since chances are you have five different players with five different ideas on how they should be playing.


Anyways I don't want to get into a whole thing. It's just that guy seems to think living in China is like North Korea or Nazi Germany when realistically living in the city feels pretty much like living anywhere else. You have food, water, shelter, electricity, and internet. If you're a westerner (or interested in such things) you can use proxies to access things like Facebook or Twitter. Otherwise you just use QQ and Weibo (or whatever, I don't really remember) cause all your friends and the celebrities you care about are there anyways.
All of your main examples are people crying out of joy and victory and overcoming something. Mir said that's acceptable on top of it. He only used DCs situation as the one place you can't cry.
For what it's worth, yes I think Slade is a bit greasy but I don't think he's an evil person. Is he a serial 'housewife shagger'? Well yes, but Gretchen has been off the housewives for a number of years now and they seem happy together so good luck to them. I don't blame Slade for firing back at Vicki, she slandered him by using his children against him for years. FYI He continued to pay what child support he could, he just couldn't afford the same amounts he could before the recession hit.
It's because this 'luck' that my wallet is looking more full and healthier xD

Noam Chomsky theorized that brains are equipped with pre-arranged pathways attuned to some sort of transcendent linguistic structure thats shared between humans. When mind reading in another language, you may be interpreting the emotions and context of that persons mind and filling in the specifics with your own vernacular.

This really needs to be stickied and known more. (Even though it has been mentioned alot, most newer students may not have the opportunity to see it). 

What you said is so true. The most important metric for choosing colleges should personal fit.
Average starting pitchers are younger I'll give you that but, the average age of pitchers overall has gone up not down over time. Improvements in surgery and training means the career length is the longest it's been.

Either way I adjusted it to a more accurate number because I'm reaching for low end stuff on one side and high on the other.

I feel the same way.  Last year at this time, I was still reeling from Comey's July 5 announcement that Clinton did not intend to break several laws multiple times.  W the overloving F?  Each day leading up to that event I would check the internet to see if there was an indictment yet.  I was right there with H.A. Goodman thinking indictments were "imminent," much the same way lefties are waiting for impeachment any day now.  At least my angst was based in reality.

They're 10 minute spanish lessons done a couple who are both spanish teachers. One is a native english speaker who learned spanish, the other is the native spanish speaker who learned english. Perfect pair.

After every few lessons they just have a full conversation in spanish spoken slow enough to understand, that includes the topics discussed in previous lessons.

I listen to one or two whenever I have nothing to do at work and it's helped my spanish immensely.

This is dense stuff. I've approached it three times already and still struggling to understand it fully. A lot of it has never crossed my mind like weather God is self-evident. But here are my main take-aways.

* Aquinas seems to be drive home on the point that God is infinite a la His lack of body/form/matter and state of action.
* I hope he revisits the issue of evil, because it really is only mentioned in passing and probably diserves it's own article, if not question, not just a passing objection.
* I really like how Aquinas interprets Gn 1:26 in light of God being body-less-ness.
      
     &gt;Reply to Objection 2: Man is said to be after the image of God, not as  regards his body, but as regards that whereby he excels other animals.  Hence, when it is said, "Let us make man to our image and likeness", it  is added, "And let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea" (Gn.  1:26). Now man excels all animals by his reason and intelligence; hence  it is according to his intelligence and reason, which are incorporeal,  that man is said to be according to the image of God.

Makes sense. Where I'm from malls are really just stores. If there's other value adds like entertainment, arcades, cinemas, etc that's great, but the focus is on shopping.

Here the malls seem more experience driven (you could spend hours and hours - shopping, bowling, watching a movie, eating, grabbing coffee, etc.) and one-stop (grocery stores, appliance stores, etc.)
Same here!

Heres the thing, the flight bomb scare was pretty big on the grand scheme of things, if wasn't even actually ON stream but it hit the damn news, thats big ya know. 

I guess what it'll come down to is just being a bit more personally safe. Giving out flight and gate information is beyond board and in future he and others should just keep anything that major in the complete dark, don't even stream in the airport, it's just not worth it.

As for people calling stores, I think it would make sense for streamers to let the stores know ahead of it happening that people can and will call in. Most people are cool and understanding in life, maybe make it out to the owner as free advertising or something. Some people will be down and some won't. Also just to spend as much time outside or on the move as possible instead of setting up in someones store or restaurant. At least until Twitch stops blanket banning all over the show instead of dealing with the real issue which is persecuting and making examples of the callers.
Apparently if you are a rich company you are expected to hand over millions of dollars to a charity every time this happens.
&gt; So, already explaining that I had to work more just to reach an even playing field on the field

That should be fixed, yes.

&gt; you think I should have to work even harder so the privileged can enjoy even more of their privilege?

No, but that doesn't mean you're right to strip their successes from them either.
Thanks
Now I have more money in the budget, drop it in a state with higher regressive taxes, gas and sales.
ow that edge. you mustve been fun during your emo phase in high school.
My friends 3DS would disconnect every time they got a text if their cell phone was in their pocket.

We eventually had to turn our phones off entirely... Or place them across the room we were in in a table in the corner. 

We sat at each end of a standard couch. 

So... The 3ds really wasn't a shining example of great local wireless.
I hadn't thought of prep time, good point! :)

Forgive me if I'm not as well versed in Reddit speak as you.  

In your little world, do statistics work differently?
Cordless phone in your house. The ability to carry it in the backyard and take a call while BBQ'ing or whatever was cool. Prior to that you had the 25 ft cord that was always tangeled up and pinched from trying to make a private call in the other room with the door shut.  

The struggle was real...
Hmm. Guess it isn't safe.
Thanks. That's a hell of a promo. If they do that again, the market is going to be finished

Is it for global? Cause maintenance is supposed to be tonight so you probably just downloaded too early. RIP you.

In such cases we are often able to offer them a discount down to the Steam price equivalent if they want to pledge up for the beta.

Of course, they are still getting the final game cheaper than new buyers on Steam.
Nah. The thing is there isn't a lot of publisher in sea and likewise the customer base isn't as huge as NA even though sea has 600m, many are do not have a internet connection.

All in all, the lack of publishers and profits drive it to p2w model.

Player still play because lack of choice and hates lag.
I'm the kind of guy who downloads 20-60GB games on Steam every other week. Is there a place with free wifi around campus?
Is recoil different on pc than console? Seems more tame on console. I suppose that makes sense though, with the different peripherals in use.

Do you have sources that outline how his proposals, exactly, would throw us into crippling debt? And I'm not talking about your armchair economic outline. I mean genuine, solid data showing the effects of his proposals. 

Edit: why am I being downvoted for asking for sources? I don't care if people don't support Bernie, but don't make sweeping statements without backing them up. That's just lazy.
You are an amazing, wonderful person and I'm sure you have lots of friends that love you and care about you.

Doesn't seem like Tooms. Tooms plays it on a loop. This guy seemed like he yelled once and didn't repeat.
if you are gonna put a statement why would you delete it? Are you so scared of backlash or anything countering your points? there is a difference between being cocky and being a downright ass, saying I'm the best player in the world is cocky, calling people easy or garbage is beyond cocky, calling out an entire country unprovoked is actually just racist. I haven't seen any chinese fans saying fuck you to any of eg's members outside sumail yet and interestingly sumail is its newest member, care to explain why is that? They are flaming sumail because sumail provoked them, don't turn this shit around on them. If ppd started calling everybody shit you'd think people won't flame the hell out of him?

and since when is the western fanbase the embodiment of virtual and good sportsmanship? where the fuck were you when ixmike was getting flamed every day? or when tc was called trash carry? or literally anything involving xvost and many of it went way beyond memes. Not to mention all the racist shit that has happened over the years, yeah people here are really respectful towards peruvian players arent they? giving posts saying we should wipe out peruvians hundreds of upvotes sure is funny right? Hell League of Legends which have a very similiar fanbase recently had a transgendered player, everything you'd expect to happen happened. Just because memes and jokes exist doesn't mean everything is in good spirits, downright disgusting attitudes are everywhere. Get off your fucking high horse

Hmmm yes I believe talking to the counsellor would be very helpful, I will be sure to do that tomorrow as well. I suspect this can be tied to the passing of his mother, and I think it would be better if he could talk to a professional about everything.

Ok the subject, why do we keep on posting PJW's swill?
Can we take a break from Batman please? There are plenty of other DC heroes that deserve a chance. Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, Arkham Origins, Arkham Knight, Lego Batman 1-3, Telltale Batman, and Batman VR. That's 9 Batman games in the past 8 years. 

I wanna be Superman, and explore the Superman mythos in a video game. I wanna play as Wonder Woman and fight mythological gods and monsters. I wanna play as Green Lantern and be a space cop. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so, because all people want is Batman, and that's all we're ever gonna get. It just sucks man. We shouldn't stop getting Batman, but we shouldn't ONLY get Batman either. This rich and exciting universe with all kinds of great heroes, villains, weirdos and settings will remain untapped in the video game world. For now all I have is Injustice 2, which I'm sure will be good, but I'll die happy if I ever get to play a great Superman game.
This house is pathetic xD
Thanks for doing it!
I would get texts from some guy who worked at a gym or something. After texting him back that he had the wrong number 3 times I began to agree to cover his shifts. After 2 times agreeing and obviously not showing up, he stopped texting me.

I would argue that the sample sizes were skewed by the fact that many earlier homosexuals were of a more affluent background and educational attainment compared to the current generation. Post-HIV crisis, including the club scene, "pride parades". "bug chasing", and other perversions, I'm not sure it's safe to assume that the average homosexual couple is as stable as researchers assumed when conducting those research based on homosexuals back in the 1950s and 60s.

Hey man!

Probably neuro (yeah, I know, original at Brandeis) or bio, but I'm also interested in possibly double majoring with English. I'm not sure exactly, but it'll be something involving bio/neuro and English/history, and I think I can make it work there.

How about you?

Thinking they will intentionally lose is not stupid. They have nothing to play for - they can't make a Europe spot and they can't be relegated either. The only difference between winning and losing is who wins the league - Barcelona or Madrid. They will not win the league for Barcelona.
Pretty sure it's similar to me. He is currently pushing paper, filling out reports, doing analysis and businessy stuff and then when the "real" work needs to be done, he dispatches a ticket to the server team or hardware team and they do the fixing. He wants to be the guy that gets the tickets and fixes the server or hardware.

Sounds to me like he's sort of an accounts manager or business analyst. Not the guy who perform the work, just the guy that orders it. Correct me if I'm wrong.

WOW that is a lengthy academic paper, but in the interests of responding tonight and not next week, I'll go over your summation of the test (and also, you need () to make a hyperlink on reddit, not {}).

I'm gonna quibble a lot on the wording of this test, because it says a lot of things like "Women do [X thing]", many of those things being falling into common self-serving biases, which will generate false positives from respondents who believe PEOPLE do those things, or that left-wing culture is TEACHING women to do those things (and everyone learns from their culture, good and bad), rather than it being their inherent nature.

And while it should be common sense to presume that's not what the test MEANS, the fact that they say "most women" for a FEW of the questions, confuses the intent, and could lead a person to believe that thinking ANY women do the things they don't specify require MOST women, is misogynistic thinking.

I also have a serious problem with the two questions that substitute "women" with "feminists", having a negative opinion of the feminist movement is NOT the same thing as misogyny, because feminism doesn't speak for all, or even most women.  What is the current stat, 17% of women identify as feminists?

Presuming the rephrasing of these questions to presume they all are asking one's opinion of men and women in general, as essential identities (ewww, gender essentialism...), discounting the inherent flaws of human nature, and removing mentions of feminism, my answers would be as follows:



    Women exaggerate problems at work

No

    Women are too easily offended

no

    Most women interpret innocent remarks as sexist

no

    When women lose fairly, they claim discrimination

no

    Women seek special favors under guise of equality

no

    Women make unreasonable demands

No

    Women are seeking more power than men

No

    Women seek power by gaining control over men

Yes

    Most women tease men sexually

Yes

    Once a man commits, she puts him on a tight leash

No

    Women fail to appreciate all men do for them

No

    A good woman should be set on a pedestal

No

    Women should be cherished and protected by men

Yes

    Men should sacrifice to provide for women

Within reason

    In a disaster, women need to be rescued first

No

    Women have a superior moral sensibility

No

    Women have a quality of purity few men possess

No

    Women have a more refined sense of culture, taste

No

    Every man ought to have a woman he adores

Every straight man?  Well in an ideal world EVERYONE would find true love, but I recognize it's unrealistic to expect.

    Men are not complete without women

No

    Despite accomplishment, men are incomplete without women

No, and redundant

    People are often unhappy without heterosexual romance

OFTEN?  Absolutely.  ALWAYS?  No.

So how sexist does that make me according to their rules?

As for how GG or SJWs might answer the question, I really have no way of answering on behalf of such broad groups, you'd have to poll people, and even then many would probably say what they think you want to hear.

gahd im sorry it was just a joke officer!  
And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling circlejerkers!
more than likely, yes. especially depending on what you mean by "start". if you don't have any experience playing competitively at a high level in similar games, your already low chances get much lower.

I try to.
&gt;The Syrian civil war started out with most of the rebels being moderate secularists too, but when the war got too hot most of them bailed and for the most part only the extremists are left. I don't think it's inherent to either side, but nationalism or religious fanaticism can be very motivating when there's a hot, existential war going on. Moderate reasonable people don't make the best soldiers. Fighting for God though, that's good motivation.

You cannot make that assumption. A huge procentage of ISIS members are foreigners and not syrians, all because of a proxy war that is only making matter worse for the syrian people. There is a reason why they were moderate in the beginning, because they were syrians and not psycho imported there to create choas and lay waste to the syrian societies.

As for the situation in Palestine, it has never been about religion but always about freedom. This is why religious persecution in Palestine is low in comparisson to other countries. There are still problems but I believe we palestinians will able to tackle them rather nicely in the end and will not turn to as "evil extremist taliban-inspired, alqueda-trained, isis-loving, and hitler-worshipping sharia-ruled islamist country" as Bibi would like all to believe.

Oh, hey me. I always felt like that, if I died, it wouldn't be too bad. I mean, yeah, my family would feel pretty shit (understatement) and the funeral expenses and shit would be... well, shit, but apart from that I feel like it'd be better in the long run.

In any case, I'm seeing a counsellor to help me with anxiety. She's also been helping me reshape my outlook on life so hopeful this time next year I'll be cool with living. Well, more than now. I'm cool with living now but I'm also cool with dying.

I recommend against having an experiment log. I just don't see any way that experiments could make this more interesting, aside from just telling us what the description already told us.

The description, by the way, needs some cutting down. There's no reason to refer to the person as a subject, no reason for tons of footnotes, no reason for the collapsibles either. This needs a lot of cutting down because it's a fairly simple concept. The Wondertainment link also seems kind of pointless. It doesn't add to the narrative in many ways.

I would recommend cleaning this up, actually finishing the parts that are currently unfinished, and then putting it on the [forums](http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-50864/p/1). The subreddit is fine, but if you want critique from experienced SCP writers, the forums are the best place to go. It may take a bit to get a response, though. Actually, if you want you can send me a link to a forum post if/when you make it and I'll do a more in depth review and point out specific sentences and phrases that could be fixed.

Good luck working on this.

EDIT: Also, the note from doctor Reddick is completely useless. I'd recommend cutting that entirely.
correct, so you ever just kinda burp and food comes into your mouth? that's regurg. Where as puking is a very *active* process. Very very different things in animals and it's important to recognize which it is when it occurs as it totally changes treatment and diagnosis. As he said before, in a dog you'll see abdominal effort, contractions, with vomiting, with regurg they just put their head down and go blahhhhh and stuff comes out but they don't have effort behind it

Well then it must have been my problem! I'm glad it is so. Thanks anyway, Destin!
Hat are you leaning towards no or yes
First impression - Your posture in your first pic is hunchback, big turn off. Also, you're wearing shades. Can't see you. Who are you?

That, alone, is a huge problem. Your first pic is CRUCIAL!

Focus on the face. Good lighting. Clear face. Little smile.
Thank you :-) it breaks my heart too - he is so sweet. I will have to post some updated pics once he is looking healthy!

"I tried writing a script to put them under localized control but it conflicts with the firmware," *Red explains.* "The new Dynamic Environment Area Regulation protocols are hard-coded into the hardware itself now, and that's all linked to central environmental control. I've got some of our engineers shutting down the microclimate generators since those seem to be the biggest problem."

*Red sighs.* "Supposedly," *she continues,* "and take this with a grain of salt, the firmware fix should be ready in less than 12 hours, but I don't want to risk anyone getting hurt or systems getting damaged before then."

*She drums her fingers on the top of the console as she thinks.* "Do you think you could write a check-script to loop in internal sensors and adjust on the fly to create a more normalized environment? It might not be faster than shutting all the microclimate nodes down, but it'd probably require less fixing afterward."
ha thats great

Businessweek literally ranked it as the 4th best undergraduate business program last year.

https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-best-undergrad-business-schools/

Up 4 spots from the year before. And in the world of business, Bloomberg is arguably more reputable than Business Insider. 

It's doing better than it's ever done before.

I feel like i saw this on memebase in good ol' 2012
Nysha flashed her a charming smile, and brushed her hair back. She felt her heart flutter in an odd way when looking at the Princess. Was it nerves? Nysha wasn’t a particularly nervous woman. 

She watched as the Princess rose and walked across the room. Nysha stayed put and stood tall.

“I have indeed. This palace is beautiful, and everyone I have met here has been more than accommodating.” She glanced down for a brief moment, “But don’t worry. Now that my nephew has been returned to me, we fully plan on heading back home and we’ll be out of your way. Unless something changes, of course.”
Tight.

Even if Matt never fully breaks again, Dented Matt is still great.
So interesting! Thanks for taking the time to respond, I didn't even think about the trip length with the higher doses. Those 3 days were probably crazy, I can't even imagine. 

I'm glad you've gained insight into life and yourself, that's the most important thing always imo.
Was talking specifically about the aircraft where irons are actually the primary, low tier ones like the SBD-3 and the F2A, but yeah backup irons could certainly be folded into something like this as well.
Former HVAC installer. It's normally not that bad considering one person will be outside working on the condenser, and the other will usually be in a garage with the door open. The worst is being in an attic in summer trying to lift a Air Handler in there. Air Handlers are usually 200-350 pounds, and the hottest attic I've worked in was 150 degrees farenheit. I learned pretty quickly that heat exhaustion is a bitch and sets in rapidly, and human skin combusts at temperatures over 155. Thankfully, normal jobs took no longer than 2-2 and a half hours. So you weren't in the heat for too long, plus taking occasional breaks in the van for well-deserved A/C. Your health comes before your job in that field.
One should also take into consideration that Plup, in relatively effortless fashion, beat Chu at Summit.

&gt; Then we get the spooky Wyatt teleporting graphic over Roman's interview followed by "I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU!"

Followed by the arena going dark and the lights coming back on to see Undertaker's urn, Kane's mask, Ric Flair's robe, Zack Ryder's beard, the audience's dignity, and Randy Orton's bronzer.
That is exactly how I feel when I finish anything with an amazing story. Books, games, anything. Its a bittersweet feeling, but so worth it.
Maybe I'm just a "stupid American" and all, but the chance to vote for "Neither one" was about a week ago, and that choice lost.
What?
&gt;But, why not use the suits to develop Insomnia? The heroes could be a team from an Insomnian kids show that all four watched; and then they could have recovered the Magitek suits and gotten them modified with that in mind.

Or a King's Knight cosplay?

Yea I agree. I know it's an exploit and it needs to be fixed, but I've been kinda enjoying this temporary meta shift. I've been saying for a while that his laser should be more transparent or invisible so it was interesting to actually be able to see how it would play out in game. 

It does get cheap kills at first,  but once you tell your team what to look out for it didn't affect games in a negative way.  People were actually picking IQ...for her ability...
Exactly why I want her tbh fam
Because it's Mario Kart. Been this way for decades. It makes it fun because whether you're in first or in last, you have a chance of winning.
...what?

No, I think Jennifer Hale's voice acting radiates more cool confidence than Meer's does. But nice job bringing a completely irrelevant argument into it.
So... why was Cass and Show the main event?
The poster was asking about requirements, so I was trying to cover all the basics, but by all means leave out the hammer arrestor and try to use 1/2" line if you can, but you'll have to increase to 3/4" to plumb in a flushometer for a urinal, don't you agree? Maybe he can increase the last 2 inches of pipe? I guess I'm being overzealous by stating using 3/4" the whole way and using an arrestor.

It is going to be a bit jerky since, in a sense, it is a DCT/Torque Converter hybrid AT.

That being said, there seems to have been a large number of people who had bad transmissions in the past few years.
Depends on how famous that person is. I wouldn't mind Beyonce cutting in line at DQ because holy shit I saw beyonce??? But if it's just a "famous" influencer, go back in line.
I always measure things in furlongs per fortnight.
The visuals are fucking insane also.  I've only done once, but the visuals were way crazier than LSD, but the headspace was still mild.
Rubick stole Soul Rip from Undying and finished Morphling off with it.
Focus on how cheap that insulation board was, and look into cheaper alternatives for natural terrain
Curveball, great or excellent, and good timing.  Be on the dominant team if you can.
How does that make them self serving. If they understood the consequences of their actions it would help people and the world. For example if they threw a plastic bag or something. Humans would still have empathy.

If you agree on "Nobody can predict the future", why do you so firmly believe that main chain only can be settle layer? Why do you want to make so important decisions for the future people who will have A LOT MORE DATA and A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE than now exists?


I don't think that's reasonable.

I am way too excited for this box that I probably won't see for months.

It's one that took me a while to learn. Longer than I care to admit.
explain.
Exactly. And he's just sitting on his ass mooching of Leann.
I want the squad version in camo so bad.
I got a job for 6 weeks verbally navigating a UAV thing for a guy who wanted to get Arial shots of old castles in Ireland. Found him on gumtree.
And if multiple enemies--potentially including the boss--select their moves all at the same time, or at least all before the boss's attack animation starts, what then?  I guarantee it's possible to select an action during an enemy attack animation and then have another enemy act BEFORE your action, at least in FFVI.

I'm not disagreeing that ATB games have different flow from static turn-based games.  However, static turn-based games like the early Final Fantasy or SaGa (a.k.a. Final Fantasy Legend) games have a different flow than static turn-based games like FFTactics and FFX, which in turn have a different flow from static turn-based games like Xenosaga or Chrono Cross.  In all of these cases, however, the actions during battle still occur in distinct turns instead of potentially happening at the same time.  "Flow" is not a good way to try to pin down what exactly you want the term "turn-based" to mean.

And I'd still like to hear your thoughts on Grandia's battle system.
Yeah... I definitely don't like horny Melissa better... Not at all... Maybe they should check in with horny Melissa more this episode... I sure do hope they end this horny Melissa storyline... ^^Not.
I set a few social goals for myself for the early 2016. They are

1. Increase eye contact when speaking with people by 100%
2. Reduce the advice I give in real life by 50%. (I often give too much advice and it appears patronizing)
3. Listen more, and try to learn how to provide people spaces to speak
4. Pay extra attention to social cues

It's going pretty well so far, and I think I'm beginning to see the effects. I'm capable of commanding more respect than before, and people seem to like me more.
I judge people who are running.  Oh look. It's that lady again.  Wow she's been running for awhile and still has those jiggly thighs. That person is crazy.  It's so hot out.  They're going to faint.  Etc.  I hate running for exercise.
That's Labor in a nutshell.
The Alamo.

I still skip the ending and tell myself that Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett survived and retired to run a fishing camp near Matagorda Bay.
It's so adorable.
It's not about the cards you are dealt but how you play them.

Even when life shits on you, you learn and grow from it. Make yourself a better person and don't make the same mistakes twice
Sounds cool.  My PSN is bs3930, add me.
From what other recruits that have recently passed have told me, more recruits are getting through rouge. What that means is, after all of the people who washed of for medical, mental and physical shortcoming leave, the amount of people who are fit that get through is larger. That means if you have no medical problems, you don't have any metal in you and you can run a 9 on the luc ledger with 8 or so pull ups you have a good chance of getting to rouge. And, as I said, there is a higher percentage of applicants getting through rouge. 

About the ticket. First, you should buy a two way ticket, they usually cost only a small amount more than a one way. Make sure the return date is at least 30 days later. Second, Just plan out your route ahead of time, use Google maps. If you get lost, just walk up to a local, point to yourself and say "Legion Entranger" or "Fort de Nogent?" And they should point you in the right direction. Or you could get a plane ticket to Marseille, where Aubagne is just a short train ride away, and you won't have to traverse Paris. 

As for the criminal record, if it is truly destroyed and there is no way for them to find out about it then why would you tell them? If they do find out whithin 6 months of you signing your contract, however you may be kicked out. As long as you weren't selling drugs it won't disqualify you, but it would help if they didn't know. Use your descretion. 

Hope this helped, and Bonne Chance!
Before the revival, she needed 4x mp lb to SS3 x3. Now with her SS3+, you can go all attack.

I really liked Christmas. Part of me is hoping she'll come out of her med-induced rage stupor tomorrow morning, realize she was being a huge asshole, and apologize.

But I'm not not expecting that at this point, at all.
You'll need all-star cards for the Samdberg program. Grab the cheap ones and create an entire line up of all star cards. Play a team with low pitching on rookie and you'll get that Goldy soon.
Despite playing 4-on-5 for large portions of the game, the Iowa non-Uthoffs had a 3 point lead late but inexplicably pulled their best scorer and blew the lead down the stretch. :)
Wow these both worked for me. Thanks!!
With a low to mid range GPU (1070 or lower) the performance gains of faster memory are negligible since you're going to be mostly GPU limited anyway. 2400MHz with the tightest timings your budget allows is probably the sweet spot.

If you're busting out a 1080Ti and aiming for high refresh gaming though then faster memory becomes more useful, the gains still aren't enormous though.

We play North twice this season too (Rounds 7 &amp; 19).  So North can tip the balance this year by winning them both.

If we lose Round 7, Round 19 is going to take on a whole new level of significance.  The 50/50 Clash, perhaps?
This has been said since the challenge started

I've heard so many things it's weird that there is no way to check but if it's meant for me it will happen I am not gonna stress it.
Kids with phones. I wasn't even allowed inside the house between 10-6 during the day until I was like 12. We played outside. Now kids have phones at age 6!
Cause he is
Lots of legal cards are random tho. Or is it the combination of random + competitive that's problematic?
OP, there is no easy way to tell you this so I'm just going to say it: You're retarded, son.
Surely it's the young drunk guy who's especially 'swift' in this case?
Yes the professional game developers behind some of the most sucsessful FPS games ever are idiots and you, the arm chair developer have cracked the code but they cant see your genius.
W-w-what? I'm gonna be ignored by you? NNNNOOOOOOO! COME BACK! I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HAVE THE GODSEND THAT IS YOU IN MY LIFE!!

Okay, this is what I was looking for. I truly believed that we need muscle confusion. Now I see that is simply not the case. The reason I stopped seeing gains isn't because of a lack of muscle confusion, but probably because my routine wasn't encompassing enough. I probably need to check my diet as well

Memebox recently came out with this new mesh-type cushion with very iridescent packaging and a selection of five shades, very similar to the [Etude House Any Cushion Cream Filter](http://www.etude.co.kr/product.do?method=view&amp;prdCd=103001342).

Supposedly, this cushion is supposed to have great coverage, and really good adherence of which is what most mesh-type cushions in general are known for.

The retail price for this cushion is 17,500 KRW and it is currently only available at Olive Young.

What do you guys think?

Except that there are lots of people who have used the same definition since then. It's an abused word, but I find traditional Marxist/Leftcom critiques of those other strands of "socialism" to be really fucking on point most of the time. Those other strands, at least from what I've read of them, are usually fairly internally inconsistent whereas traditional Marxism/Leftcommunism is very internally consistent, which I believe is very important for a theory to strive for. This leads me to believe that most of those other strands of theory are generally inferior and use inferior definitions since they can't even be consistent internally, let alone externally, with the rest of the world. 

Maybe that makes more sense as to why I believe that Marx' definition is the "correct one".

According to the Wikipedia article on Sad Wings of Destiny:

&gt; During the Sad Wings sessions, Howells encouraged the band to work on a heavy metal cover of "Diamonds &amp; Rust" by folk singer Joan Baez, but it did not appear on the album. The band had a hit in the UK with a re-recording of the cover version the following year, after they had moved to CBS Records.

The "Howells" they refer to is Dave Howells, who (I believe), was the head of Gull Records at the time. Interesting how the band were essentially pressured to do the song in the first place, and yet it's become a concert staple. What I want to know is how Dave Howells came to think of Diamonds &amp; Rust as a cover. Seems like such an odd choice, especially coming from a record company executive.
I think you're underpreparing hard. Having 20 songs for an hour is way too little and doesn't give you room to adjust if the crowd isn't loving it. I usually have around 70 tracks for an hour of playing just to have a wide selection based on the crowds behavior. 


Also I feel you on the dance music because it's a dance behavior but that's something I learned the hard way. You have to make sure that your crowd will love mainstream edm in order to play it, or be in the right environment like a club. 

I would love to see you do well, but it's very demoralizing when you just see the crowd standing around.

Stuff you should know

Very funny guys who are doing this. They have hundreds (700?) of episodes and it's great for your commute or in general. Even though if a topic doesn't sound interesting at all for you, you will be surprised what they do about that. You learn something every time and I really like that. 

They also have holiday themed special episodes (Halloween for example). They are really good. 

In iTunes they cap the episode limit on 300 or so but in their website you'll find allow episodes.
A few things:

* There's no need to be hating on agile development.  That's completely orthogonal to whether a developer is good or not.
* I'm calling BS on your "born in it, molded by it" thing.  Software development is certainly a craft and a journey, but it's not something that's only for specially anointed people to do.  It's like any other trade.  Take plumbing, for instance.  There are people whose parent was a plumber, whose grandparent was a plumber, and so forth, and they decide to go into the trade.  There are other people who say, "Hey, this looks like an interesting job that might align with my skill set -- let me see about getting into that."  Both are valid.

It's an arrangement of the main force theme.
This article provides zero evidence of anything.  First off, the doctor accused of doing this died in 2008 (Dr. Jan Karbaat) so we are already talking about events that ended nearly a decade ago at the latest.  The article says anything about intent, as the title infers.  Instead, it sounds like a poorly run (to the point of criminal) fertility clinic that aimed for results only, with articles talking about issues at the clinic dating as far back as 2002 that I could find (http://krant.telegraaf.nl/krant/archief/20020302/teksten/bin.sperma.zaad.spermabank.html).  Finally, the title includes "Muslim" when none of the articles say anything about "Muslim" only that the man was from Surinam, which is less than 15% Muslim.  this is a far cry to assume that he is Muslim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Suriname).
He said he had a headache, so he need the ice pack for it.
No Idea. The watch isn't even listed on the Bulova website. There are many in the Portland metro area.
&gt; There's a check box in the token light settings for all players see light. Make sure it's unchecked.

I believe this is your answer as long as permissions are set properly. 

First, I'm not sure if the advice I give here will work for a "single user" using a single account. Maybe try making two separate accounts and join the game as two separate players to test this out. 

I can tell you how to allow each player to see only what their assigned token can see with dynamic lighting. Here you go &amp; hope it helps...

**For things to work the way you want them to you can't allow players to control other player's tokens or character sheets.**

If you link each token to a character sheet it will solve your problem as long as each character sheet's permissions are assigned to each individual player.

You probably know some of this stuff, but here's a sort of walkthrough:

First, each player should only have permission to edit their own character sheet.

Second, assign each token to the appropriate character sheet. Double click each token and use the "represents character" drop down to choose which character sheet in the Journal each token represents.

When you have each token assigned and set up the way you want it, then link the token to the character sheet (select the token by clicking on it, open the character sheet it represents&gt;edit&gt;"default token").

Essentially, this will prevent players who don't have permission to open a given character sheet from moving that sheet's token, or "see" from that token's point of view (as long as "see light" is unchecked in dynamic lighting settings).

I wrote this from memory as I don't currently have a paid subscription, so sorry if I got anything wrong. Hope this helps!

(note that if a player has a torch, say, then the other players should be allowed to see light from that torch. I usually leave "see light" on for these kind of tokens for this reason. Something like Darkvision is hard to simulate, but turning off "see light" and setting light for the appropriate range for that character works okay).

Grew up with several.

Alex Baldwin - Bit of a pompous d-bag back then (Jr HS days, shared several classes), wanted to be called Xander, long before he decided he wanted to be called Alec. His dad was a teacher at one of the two HS's in the district. He also looked like a male model, 6' at 14 years old, which the girls loved but the rest of us scrawny 14 year olds didn't.

Brian Setzer - Was incredibly talented on guitar, my brother jammed with him a lot, and that is about when my brother realized what real talent was, and decided to go to college and forget about being a guitar player in a rock band after realizing how much better Setzer was. Very nice guy, down to earth, and an incredible guitar player.

Bob Nelson - Comedian, had a few HBO specials back in the 80's, sat next to him in a few classes, and often had to explain to the teacher when they asked me what I found so funny. Great guy.

Late reply, but you're right. There are two different worlds out there. I've worked desk jobs and hard labor but I'm still a socially awkward person. The working people are generally "hard" and will put stuff like addiction out there. I should be more supportive but some things break my "pre scripted human interaction" routine. Next time, I'll congratulate them. (I'm not being false or placating, I struggle with alcohol).

Way I figure it, there's a number of ways to force your players to ground temporarily, or at least pay attention to their surroundings while in the sky.

* Throw a storm at them from time to time. Sailing in rough seas can be dangerous, why should flying in rough skies be any different?

* Their supplies aren't infinite. They have to land somewhere to get them, and that's when you throw quests, ambushes, or general goings-on at them.

* Sometimes things have to be done in areas that can't be reached by airship. Dense forest, caves and other underground areas, any kind of hostile territory, etc. Even cities may have no-fly zones enforced. If the players can't see it from the sky, they may want to pound dirt to find it.

* Let's not forget simply adding aerial content, as well. Lots of flying things that want to eat people, and where there are ships, there will be pirates. Sky pirates are cliche, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less cool.

From there you can continue to develop the world.

Of course, industry is super vague. We usually imply the for-profit sector, but obviously that is not all there is in industry (or outside academia). And for some positions, the type of physics/research will matter, but I was responding about jobs that are agnostic about that, first because I'm obviously not qualified to speak on that, and second because this is generalist advice that isn't meant to be about jobs that are looking for a specific type of research. The second point brings up another key assumption, that the "industry" job requires you to transfer your skills, and is not necessarily looking for people with your research and physics type background.

Are you saying consulting isn't as plentiful as it used to be? I haven't heard anything about them slowing down, and if anything more of the firms that didn't hire PhDs are seeing applications from people with (any kind of) PhDs and snapping them up.

I've heard the "PhD is a turn off" argument many times before, beyond just the field of physics. And I've always noticed that a PhD is detrimental in a position that is not challenging, not rewarding, and usually below the level that a person with a PhD would be qualified for and interested in. I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but I think it hurts everyone when people either leave their PhD off their resume in fear of that (so what are they going to say they have been doing all that time?), or when they apply for jobs that they won't like, and that the employer knows they won't like, because that's not fooling anyone.

So of course a PhD can be detrimental, anything "can" be a bad fit, following the same logic. However, it is the responsibility of the job seeker, in my opinion, to apply to jobs that make sense for them, and to tailor their application to the position and to the business world. I've seen much more of the latter as a barrier to non-academic employment than the mythical "im overqualified, therefore the PhD is detrimental" situation.

It's great to want to relax, but what you want in the short term may not fit well in the long term, and perhaps the employer/hiring manager knows that and/or has seen that before. I know many PhDs in jobs with no increased responsibility/title/pay and they might have liked the mindless relaxing at the start, but let's face it, they're ambitious and high achieving people, so the mindless job idea doesn't work for very long.

I see what you're saying, but I don't think it's possible to make no assumptions. I should state them, I agree with you, and I apologize for not putting all that in a comment I made on mobile, given that I thought it would be understood for what it is; generalist advice with some physics examples.

If you are saying physicists don't think they are qualified or require some specific degree/certification, why did you mention the data science fellowships? You don't need the fellowship if you're so confident in your abilities, right? Everyone else in the thread is also suggesting bootcamps and certifications, so I don't think that makes sense.

Are you sure that's the main reason for PhDs having trouble getting industry jobs? Because you've said it multiple times here, and I've heard it super often, but like I said, there are a lot of other reasons people don't get hired. Unless you're sure it's not poor interviewing skills, and inability to communicate how what you've done adds value and can have a positive business impact, and there is a lack of cultural/values fit between you and the company, then you could make a case that it's some negative assumption about physics PhDs.

"Perhaps we will." Jeyne replied, no warmth behind her words. "I haven't had the pleasure of visiting her castle, unfortunately." *At least, not what you mean.* She thought dryly to herself. "Perhaps someday soon, if her Grace can live without me for a month or two while we travel. I imagine it must stay warmer in the Reach than it does here in King's Landing."

I know my rankings are worthless, but I had him as the 4th best TE, and gave him a 3rd round grade, b/c he's really an oversized receiver. I mean the Redskins have like 5 of those now lol.
Hahahaha. Keep it coming. Oh man I can hardly breathe.
It'd be worse trying to enforce it and judge *exactly* when the runner started.  On top of that, the whole idea of stealing bases is based on getting as early of a jump as possible.  That rule would practically destroy stolen bases except for the extremely fast players

Yup. Just had a team of guys installing a new system in my attic - while it was 85 degrees outside. We made sure to offer them plenty of cold drinks and tipped them afterwards. 

EDIT: I know 85 degrees is not that bad. But a sunny 85 degree day *outside* means a stifling 100 degree attic.

I'd learned it was a French thing - French people have all these action-specific words, which means that things like completing a task sound "tack" and disagreeing is "nt-nt" and then there are a ton more.

That second *See No Evil* appears to have been inspired by horror classics like *Halloween 2* and *Friday the 13th Part 3*.

*Halloween 2* takes place in a dark, nearly empty hospital.  *See No Evil 2* takes place in a similar setting, but the hospital is replaced by a morgue.

In *Friday the 13th Part 3*, Jason Vorhees puts on his signature hockey mask for the first time.  In SNE2, they gave Jacob Goodnight a mask to try and give him his own signature look.

The elements at the foundation of *See No Evil 2* have been proven to work in the past.  I guess the execution just sucked balls, though.

"I can't imagine it, so it must be impossible."

I don't think that's how reality works. There are things I know are incomprehensible to me (at this point). I still don't understand quantum mechanics. I literally *cannot conceive of it*. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist; it means I don't have enough input about it. 

I think it is a sound thing to say "there exists something in the universe which is not experienced, but does exist." I don't think "well I imagined it!" counts as a valid reason to say it was conceived. I'll bet plenty of things in this world that I can not imagine (because I lack information). I don't think that means they "don't exist".
It reminds me of David Mitchell.  "Really the trick was getting people to describe reading out the lottery numbers after the lottery numbers had been called as 'predicting the lottery'."

I was very surprised (and honestly a little excited), but I actually guessed that the song was Greensleeves. However, with some of the other examples shown in the episode, I don't think I would have guessed them if we weren't told what songs they were first. In regards to seeing/hearing what you want to hear, I know in court cases it is very important not to direct the witness towards a certain answer, for this very reason. I have watched a show before which demonstrated how easy it is into manipulating someone to have a false memory. For example, they staged a car robbery, and the majority of the eye witnesses identified the perpetrator as someone who was just near the accident, because they remembered his face. It shows just how fragile our memories can be.
I might drop this game for IJ2. IJ2, if it's anything like the first, will at least offer better deals than this game. Even $5 for a new character, who I can then grind for bonus shards or something, is a much better deal than $352 for a fully maxed L5 character, not including levels, gears, and abilities. While I appreciate the whales, the game itself is almost a spit in the face to all fans of DC and the people who just can't spend hundreds a month.

You do get, that under your comment lies alot of information you just expect people to know.

Your message is not the same. First message comes off as, you can't see more than 1 FPS, why get 144 DUH?! type of message. Don't be surprised if some people react to that. Expecting others to read your other messages before answering one entry of yours isn't happening most of the times either. If I see something you wrote, that's what I'm answering to, what you do anywhere else where I actually have to look up your profile and search your name isn't my concern. What you say or do anywhere where I have to Sherlock the information isn't my business, and only concerns you and the people who happen to read that.

In this case this is what I answered to: *high tickrate is like the new "i7" of gaming. No one knows what it means, but everyone assumes it must mean it's great and better.*

They're very effective for people with ADHD and sensory issues. It's a low-brainpower way to multitask, and helps people concentrate. They're *very* helpful for people who need them. It's not about quirkiness, it's about a non-medication solution for kids who have trouble concentrating.
She's literally being forced to see that she sucks at *being a functional human being*. Even as insulting as it is to see someone break down because their life is sooooo much better than yours, that can't be a good feeling.

And remember, dealing with hardship is a skill. You may not break down because you can't get what you want, or because you don't know how to do something. But what about when you were three or four years old? That's the experience level she's probably at. And try comparing your thirteen-year-old self to the kids in pretty much any poor part of the world who have to go to work to feed their families. Maturity and age are correlated, but there's no direct causation there. Time opens the door to experience, but it's up to you to go in and see what's up. And really, if you didn't have to, would you? Wandering homeless? Watching your loved ones die?

And as pathetic as this girl's reaction is, humankind didn't build society so our kids lives would be worse. In theory, we want everyone to have her life. We just haven't got the distribution and longevity of all that worry-free existence sorted yet.

I don't suggest taking any more than 1000mg of APAP in a single setting because it could damage your liver. 4000mg is the maximum "recommended" dose for adults. At your weight it'd take 9000mg APAP to be a serious risk for liver damage. Not sure if it works with DXM syrup but look up cold water extraction.
I was prescribed both as well. Benzoyl peroxide will address the bacteria causing the acne while the tretinoin addresses inflammation and scarring.

I never said anything about a donation. I also didn't say anything about hodgepodge, we could almost definitely fully fund the buy out ourselves. I also didn't say anything about installments.

Riot said in the round table specifically that the reason they didn't make the buy in HIGHER was so that teams didn't necessarily have to partner with massive venture capital firms, and Regi at that same round table specifically said they might take on multiple investors.

I disagree with your take on the situation, though with neither of us being inside the situation is definitely possible that everything I just said was PR smoke and mirrors and that you're completely correct. However what I agree with and what I think is most relevant is the last bit. TSM is too big a part of LoLs success to be let go of, so they have tremendous leverage in how they approach this.

So what you are saying is in 2013, all the rusted on Labor voters voted for the Coalition?

Based on the results the more likely possibility is that all the rusted on Labor voters voted for Labor, and a big chunk of swing voters swung away from them due to Abbott being one of the most effective opposition leaders in history.

Seems like this helps prove my point more than anything

I'm not sure what to think about this. I'll have to wait for the reviews to see if all the strangeness turns into a solid experience.
Understandable. Of course you'd want to tell people on your own terms. Still, I think in the grand scheme of things it's probably a good thing that they now know. I'm sorry you didn't get to do it your way. Hopefully it at least takes a weight off your shoulders that you don't have that secret anymore. I would imagine that trying to conceal something so intrinsic to your identity would be really difficult, and a huge factor in how down you've been feeling lately. I hope that as time passes you find it to be a relief that the news is out and you can just be who you are and realize that people still love and care about you all the same.
Haha interesting reaction, and thanks

&gt; You think Quran law means rape victims get punished. 


It is Islam.  Women aren't permitted to testify in Koranic/Sharia courts so they're convicted of adultery when raped and then executed.  Why don't you read something and educate yourself.  Also you haven't provided any rebuttal to my other linked sources.  You claimed those things didn't happen and I provided proof they do.  Now you are moving the discussion elsewhere instead of addressing it.

It's important to remember in online conversations that the people actively responding are the minority, compared to the silent majority who are simply reading and considering the arguments being made by both sides. Present your best and most reasonable evidence to support your position with *them* as your audience, since you're unlikely to ever change the minds of the ones responding. Always put your best foot forward, and while I can't promise that you won't still be frustrated from time to time, I've found that it can balance that with an overall sense of accomplishment when you can see how well you comported yourself, as viewed from the perspective of a disinterested observer.
Wouldn't that be exactly what a ninja would want you to think?
&gt; you will avoid the rounding errors associated with floating point arithmetic

Note that you can safely multiply or divide by any power of two without losing precision. Internally, the FP representation stores the exponent as a base-2 number. Dividing by 8, for example, is the same as subtracting 3 from the exponent. You're fine as long as you don't underflow or overflow the exponent.

So dividing by 1024^3 shouldn't lead to any rounding error.

Eveready makes a pretty decent metal case [LED flashlight.](http://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Tactical-Metal-Handheld-Flashlight/dp/B009MJAGTK)  I EDC'd this one for about 2 years as a firefighter/EMT and it works really great.  I think it got it at Target for about $16.  Price &amp; durability rated it pretty high for me as a good, all-around flashlight...plus if it got broken or lost, I wouldn't really cry over it.

I've since upgraded to the OLight Striker as my on-duty carry...but I moved the Eveready to my around town, in the truck flashlight.

Gotta say I was super not expecting that. I figured the Charlotte match on Wednesday was to make her the first to hold both so when she lost I thought it was for sure Bayley would retain.
In my neck of the woods it's liking "bad boys" or "good men." The bad boys are fun for a good time but if they move in you get to become their mom while they go out and have fun with the side chick. The good men will try to take care of you, but are crap at sex because they were so screwed up by their mother and or church that they barely touch themselves let alone their partner.

&gt; Finn's arc completes (as much as Luke or Han in ANH) as he goes from Stormtrooper in it for himself to selflessly trying to fight Kylo in defense of Rey. 

Except he left the First Order for moral reasons, right? Pretty sure he didn't think that was the safe course of action... but then he didn't tell anyone about Starkiller base... and he lied to the rebellion (risking their attack plan, in fact) to rescue Rey. He does have some motivations towards her, but they feel very cliche to me.

You can make the case that it's no worse than Luke in ANH, and you might be right... I haven't really spend much time evaluating the OT as a story. It's sort of too much a part of my cultural upbringing for me to comment on it.

&gt; Rey goes from being curious about the outside world while tied to her home, to forced into accepting her power and understanding that she may be the only one capable of beating Kylo Ren (forced on her as she watches the only other alternative, Han, fail to save Kylo) and accepting her powers (although in sure we'll wrestle with that in TLJ quite a bit more, much like ESB Luke). Luke isn't accounted for, and is out of reach, so Rey is really the only one who can feasibly carry the day (though Luke ends up being an alternative in the end, during the denoument.

I mean, you can make that case, but her actions match those of an almost entirely passive/reactioary character... she never makes choices other than run from/escape from/fight people who are in front of her and hostile to her.

She also bugs me by having basically no flaws and being good at absolutely everything instantly. Mechanics, hand to hand combat, piloting, shooting, force powers, lightsaber combat... it feels like they really rushed that part of her development, and made her into a Mary Sue.

&gt; Han goes from scoundrel who knows he's meant to be doing something to help, to accepting his role in creating the current problems of the galaxy and dies to try to fix his mistakes (redemption, pretty easy to have closure this way). 

I disagree with that interpretation, but I actually do think Han had a satisfactory arc. I don't think he was particularly pushed to confront Kylo out of responsibility to the galaxy, because frankly, I think he went out there expecting (by his own judgement) to die... but he was choosing to trust Leia's judgement, as she'd pushed him to get their son back.

&gt; Poe is a static character, and the film never really tries to force him into the limelight as a main character. 

Except for kinda clumsily killing and resurrecting him, and making the opening sequence focused on him. I don't necessarily have a problem with him being a bland character, but to me all of the new characters are bland, so every missed opprotunity costs them.

My world went sideways when I saw my first 3D printer. 

I vividly remember the first time I watched cartoons on our new colour TV in 1972. Nightmares for weeks.
In this post, author, /u/ketryne presents a Suessian interpretation of the classic Stephen King novel "The Shining."  His key point is to demonstrate that the whimsical non-coherence of Dr. Suess aligns with the non-coherant insanity of "The Shining's" antagonist, Jack, as he embraces the darkness of the Overlook Hotel. In this way, /u/ketryne's post rejects the duality of man and how he chooses to accept the unpredictability of life and potential possession by demonic forces.  While one would assume a Suessian narrator would overcome such forces with colorful illustrations and zany rhymes it soon becomes apparent that this will not be the case.

In the first stanza the author very rationally sets the scene for the rest of the poem. The only exception is the term "glook" which hints at the Suessian journey the reader is about to embark on.  However, the lack of rhyme or meter sets the tone that something is slightly off with the narrator.

The second stanza continues to toy with the reader, implying that the unreliable narrator sees "it." The final line of the poem hits the reader like Chris Brown after a night of drinking, as the reader realizes that the narrator has been overtaken by the darkness.  This leads the reader to the poem's final conclusion, that there is nothing holding society together except a thin veil of sanity and that the only duality which man has is which insanity he will feed.
**Monarchy of Canada**

The Monarchy of Canada is at the core of both Canada's federal structure and Westminster-style of parliamentary and constitutional democracy. The monarchy is the foundation of the executive (Queen-in-Council), legislative (Queen-in-Parliament), and judicial (Queen-on-the-Bench) within both the federal and each provincial jurisdiction. The Canadian sovereign is the personification of the Canadian state and is Canada as a matter of constitutional law. The current Canadian monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 6 February 1952.

People understood your explanation the first time. YOU undermined YOURSELF by behaving counter to your own statements. It wasn't a misunderstanding with the internet or your audience. It was YOU doing something different than you SAID you were going to do.

Where I live we don't have possums or raccoons, and living beside a mountain means I've heard many calls of many animals over the years. The knocking I did wonder if it was an animal, I've had mice before but unless this is some king mouse I can't think of any animal that could make such a noise, I'll still be checking though.

I could not watch him play.  He was terrible at the game.  Not as bad as [Northernlion](https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion) (who sucked at not only XCOM 2 but also almost all other games he has on his channel) but still pretty bad.  It is painfully frustrating to watch people suck at playing games.  I got high blood pressure just from watching Northernlion played XCOM 2 preview build.

Alex raised his hand, "No offense Ms.Sonnenblume but you seemed to be slightly biased towards melee combat."

/r/socialism, actually, I must've had a lapse in concentration and wasn't paying attention, hah.

That's really sweet, thank you!
In the same wikipedia page there are statistics on the percentages. Even the US also received enormous amounts of aid from your own source. 8 billion to the 11 billion they gave the Soviets. 7thousand tanks donated to the Soviets 120000 produced by themselves. The fact that your grandmother ate US food is statistically insignificant, an anecdote. Real comparisons and history is made through statistics. Compare US aid in food if you would like to total Soviet food production. 

That anecdote is surely from the US or UK, I am sure a Russian would not say such stupidity. Was US aid very helpful and strategic, sure. But crediting the US for the war in the east is foolish.

I thought the iPhone was just a regular cell phone that could play music. I was so amazed when I finally saw someone using the *actual internet* on it, not just that shit internet phones had before then.
I actually really like that idea.  I had a hard time with the ending, and it's definitely one of the weaker parts of the film.  I also toyed around with ending on a reveal that he had imagined that whole conversation with the girl while he was standing there smoking his cigarette, but that felt like too much.
Well at least the Sabbat hit you in the face with a shovel first.
Last summer and before every news agency was reporting from people on the ground.  We were getting regular updates from that little podium at the pentagon.  We were hearing all about prep of the forces of the willing and about actions by special forces.

Last fall that all dropped to near zero.  Reports from someone with a helmet and flack jacket are few and far between.  We went a long time before getting an update on progress in the Iraqi's assault on Mosul.  Pretty much radio silence until it was all but complete.  The same pattern in Syria.

Note that I'm not complaining.  Clearly the news folks are cooperating by making big news out of tweets and whether or not someone in the GOP isn't in lock step with the leader.  Shiny stuff all around.
White Walker fingers!
Notice he takes mostly flat back and hip bumps. He appears to be trying to avoid landing on his sides for the most part but you can see him wheeze after he gets splashed. He was also working pretty stiff but then again he got pretty fucked up in their previous match so he wanted his pound in flesh.
This is just part of the deal guys get when they live with a woman. It helps to remember would you rather be happy, or right?

The US' voter turnout is already one of the worse in the western world. Telling the average american they'll need to take a knowledge test to vote will push that already meager percentage into the single digits. 

In fact, I'd argue we should ease up on voter restrictions.
Fighter strongly counters necromancer and manager when played right. If the fighter is playing right, there is hardly anything that necro and manager can do to stop them.

Tankier fighters can freely kill battleships, even good ones. But frail fighters can be handled with proper battleship techniques, so it may take a lot longer to kill them... Fortunately, battleships this good are quite rare.

Standard overlord (0 reload) requires intense techniques and timing to kill, as well as very specific fighter builds depending on your killing method. Also assuming that the overlord doesn't normally leave himself open. Glass overlord (5 reload) cannot be killed easily if one is playing correctly.

Factory cannot be killed if they stay close to their drones.

Otherwise, drone tanks don't have too many advantages to use to actually kill fighters, aside from having drone speed be slightly faster than a 7/7 booster, but that only applies to users of the standard drones, some seers lack this advantage.

the only answer I've seen that seems to explain it well doesn't make me any more willing to accept him, as I'd prefer this and many universes before it, and all the universes after had never been made.

that is, God is a Paperclip Optimizer looking for optimization for good, and doesn't consider identical universes to be creating more good, and has run out of perfect universes to make. He's a fucking arse, and still unwilling to help in any capacity in since he's already made all the universes that are even a little better, and will make universes substantially worse than ours that wish they could have it as good as us.

that's messed up. plain and simple.

Even when she was dying of cancer, had to stay in a wheelchair. The sherrif come and got my brother, took him away to jail.
She said 'I didn't think it would all end this way' and look at me and smile. 
Sometimes she was so tired from the cancer and would sit up and sleep. She would always wake up, look at you and smile.

Have it on PC, not getting it for Switch. Without mods, there's no fun in it anymore for me. Totally burned out on vanilla, and with the main weakness of the game being the actual combat there's not much replay value left after doing all the quest lines. Plus, I personally can't really get immersed into story/lore while riding the subway or whatever; killing stuff and solving puzzles in Zelda is definitely more up my alley in those situations. Still really happy they're bringing it to Switch though.

But you just literally said that MTWism is just a negative view of the "first world" this has no use whether in the imperialist nationsa and oppressed nations. Because if your whole concern and have arrived to the forgone conclusion that revolution is impossible within the imperialist nations and that people here are brought off or whatever, what makes you think people in imperialist nations will care about whats going on in the third world anyway. And furthermore if you claim that revolutionaries aren't too concerned with whats going on the imperialist nations why should/would they care about MTWism/ists in the imperialist nations? Its literally of no use to anyone at that point. And your point in saying that Marxism-Leninism is practiced in the oppressed nations and saying the practice upholds MTW line is completely wrong. The most anti-revisionist trends of Marxism-Leninism(which are VERY VERY few today) say socialist revolution is applicable in the imperialist nations and semi-colonial,semi-feudal oppressed nations new democracy to socialism. And even then it is not Marxism-Leninism guiding these revolutions it is predominantpy Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.
Avoiding you.
You're right. I crafted a third one and couldn't place it. Sorry for the bad information.

I thought she called her a  "Lincoln bitch". I thought, what does her support for Abraham Lincoln have to do with anything?

I misheard. She was actually calling her a "leakin bitch".

That makes more sense.
The full flavor Parliaments are awesome, as are the lights. I think I prefer the taste of the lights, which is odd because I usually prefer full flavor.
They fire a non-nuke at us, you want to go to a nuclear war with them. A war that would kill millions, millions who have absolutely no say in who runs NK. A war that would lead to starvation in the North and a massive refugee crisis in the South. What if they shoot at an American soldier? Go to war?
Wow, that lady went full on the instant she saw him flip the bird.

[Indiana code in question.](http://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-35-criminal-law-and-procedure/in-code-sect-35-42-2-3.html)

Also I do believe it's been held in court before that the mere flipping of the bird alone is not provocation. A reasonable person seeing a stranger on the road giving them a finger (and nothing else) would not likely provoke a reasonable person to a physical altercation. Having ZERO interactions behind the action of flipping the bird, just flipping off random people, cannot possibly be provocation.

If they had a verbal spat before or a disagreement or something, possibly (and I think that's been upheld by IN courts).... but with ZERO interaction previous I would find it hard to believe the court would rise to support the claim.

Then again, this IS Indiana courts... the ones who said we are too dumb to know if we are being illegally detained or arrested therefore have no Right to self Defense if a cop does actually illegally arrest us.

Oh, FFS. I refuse to believe they'd just kill Thrawn off yet again after making a big deal out of his return.
pretty bad finish
I don't know anything about neuroscience or psychiatry, so I can't really refute your point that 'research into a cure does more good than advocacy' - or therapy? And of course, I agree with you, I don't think that anyone should be able to speak 'on behalf of all autistic people' because it is such a broad diagnosis.

That said, you have definitely picked two videos that showcase some pretty extreme examples of self-harming behaviour, I know it's common but I think doing a search on youtube will always bias your sample toward the most extreme cases.
I believe you received sweet Saffron volts.

Good for you! You'll get as much out of it as you put in, if not more. Great suggestions here - I'd like to add IRC - International Rescue Committee. They work with local refugees and there are so many ways to help that you can probably find your niche. I've tutored adults in things like how to use a computer, helped clean up a community run after school service. They have lots of tutoring and childcare needs as well as basic maintenance- you would NOT believe the conditions they are living in. These are dire need folks who came here with almost nothing and are trying to assimilate and find jobs. They are so eager and grateful and hardworking- so gratifying to work with. Whatever you end up doing, I hope you enjoy it. Good luck.

I hope that Bray's limo crashes and no one gets hurt, but he can't make it to the arena in time to complete the match so they call it off. Then Orton and Wyatt never so much as appear on the same show again as long as they both live.  For the love of god, please keep them away from each other.
No, that's how online gaming goes.  Current status may say people are friendly and getting along, but the moment something entices players to hose another power, regardless of their Fed/Imp/Ind status, it'll happen.  Lasting permanent peace among rivals is more a matter of the limitations of the PP system, than the efforts of the factions coming to accord.  While diplomacy plays a role, the leaders of each power's factions are limited by how much control they reign over their followers.  Players pretty much follow orders when they feel like it and can ignore leaders with no repercussions.  This is a game where pvp is encouraged, don't expect me to treat it as if it isn't.

As it stands, the biggest threat to AD at the moment is 5C.  It's a leaky boat mechanic and everyone is stuck bailing or just letting it sink.  Despite all the talk, Kuki An is still sitting on our Expansion list.  It wasn't the efforts of one or two people either.  We watched the numbers as last week finished up and the logistical effort was enormous.  While we can't prove who did it (Thank you ED anonymity), we know they had to be a fairly large group.  Unaffiliated group?  Not likely.  Federation?  If so, why not brag?  So, then, who?  Nobody's given me a good answer yet.  All the posturing in the world won't change that and it doesn't seem that your touted diplomacy worked either.  Bluster and make veiled threats of ALD aggression all you want.  If a chunk of ALD wanted to go behind their leaders' backs and hose us, it'd happen, if it hasn't already.  There's not a thing you can do about it, not a thing I can do about it, and not a thing AA can do about it.

Wow. I don't want any of that, because I know what I like and I like what I like. And sometimes that includes porn. And sometimes that includes being choked. And sometimes that includes being submissive. And it definitely doesn't include your brand of feminism nor the patronizing tone that it affords you.
She wasn't bullying anyone, she and Cody (especially Cody) got bullied. Jess called Raven shady, and Paul told Raven to fake cry, so she did, and then Paul accused Cody of making Raven cry. Paul and the Paullowers then antagonized Jody for the entire afternoon and early evening until production called them one by one into the DR to tell them to stop.
True.
Family Guy actually doesn't do that too much these days. They awkwardly shoehorned Sean Penn into an episode earlier this season, but their method of dealing with guest stars tends to be more along the lines of having a famous person say one or two lines as a random character and waiting for you to discover their name in the credits.

I'm all for everyone having equal rights and everything but in some media I've seen recently is portrays the minority as superior instead of just equal such as all this gay pride stuff but if someone says they have pride in being straight they get criticised for example. Often times these people pushing for social justice become the bigots themselves because of their extreme opinions and speeches and actions. That is what I want to avoid. I want to avoid a story where the person's gender or sexual orientation or skin colour is not a central part of the story but rather what they do to fight crime is the central part of the story

Oh Japanese wrestling is amazing, that same promotion has a team belt meant for 5 guys and the belts are color coded like Power Rangers. Best thing has to be Kenny Omega in New Japan Pro Wrestling, dude comes out dressed like Wesker holding a broom, and has a bunch of video game references in his moveset. He went from wrestling (and killing) the second Yoshihiko to leading one of the biggest stables in NJPW, the Bullet Club. And he booted out *AJ Styles* in a hostile takeover.
Well is coming out, as well as Aetherflux reservoir. I may also cut Silence, as I've found it's a dead card sometimes and if my combo hits, I generally don't need to cast it anyway. I don't like cutting the 3 CMC things, especially Render Silent, but there are good points in there about generally lowering CMC and some of the more expensive rocks. I have Sol Ring in the deck, I forgot to update the list with a couple cards. Cryptic Command can likely come out, as it's 4 CMC. Budget isn't an issue, so Flusterstorm is definitely an option.

Overall, this is a gorgeous vignette. Some of your imagery is lovely, and the sense of melancholy is compelling.

I feel like you could benefit from drawing your reader into your narrative more, rather than simply telling them what is going on. I will give a couple of examples, but there are more in the story. Let me know if you want me to give more.

&gt; prison he called home.

This seems abrupt. I would let us feel how this place is stifling, make it seem claustrophobic for the reader.

&gt;An apartment complex, what many would call it so long ago, it held quite a few rooms, and a number of strange fixtures that come standard nowadays. Talking appliances, kitchen assistants, even cleaners that are built into the place; it was all a lot to take in.

Again, you tell us what is in his apartment. Let us see it unfold naturally. Have the appliances speak to him, have him try to come up with the phrase they used to use to describe his living quarters.

&gt;He saw it again; the same beautiful lady that greeted him...

I feel like her description should come first. Most of your readers will know what modern humans look like, but will be more interested in what sets her apart.

Also, the line about reproduction is confusing and may need a bit of fiddling.

Also, all of Larah's dialog at the end seems a touch too unnatural. It reads as more programmed than her programmed language. I'd think the audience should be surprised by her authenticity when she reaches that fundamental truth that she is content - the opposite of what our poor time traveler is.

I think much of this could be accomplished very, very easily, as you have already established such a moving scene. Thank you so much for sharing, and I'm happy you posted. I missed this one. :)

Single women and people of non-Saudi ethnicities are discriminated against in terms of employment and can't afford documentation to receive the allowance. And some groups, such as nomadic tribes, don't recognize the Saudi government as an authority, so they also don't seek documentation.

This is, perhaps, a rather overhyped book. Until this post, the only things I've seen adressed at *Uprooted* were outright praises for the novel as being beautiful, ground-breaking, innovative, etc...

My personal diagnosis has been that West is not well-familiar with Eastern European folklore, and thus the first competent retelling of it to a Western audience made it look ... (no pun intended) ... magic.  To me who grew up on fairy tales about enchanted -  and not always in good ways - forests, Baba Yagas, and village girls who grew up to save their land, the subject matter of the book was about as familiar as an-elves-and-goblins tale to someone who grew up in Great Britain. 

I always thought that is was a good read, but award-winning? not really.  The book never made me cringe, or lose suspence of disbelief (unlike some other books I've read recently), nor did it bore me (unlike some other books I've been reading recently).  But nothing in this book stands out and above the classical Eastern European tale, with some Polish bureaucracy thrown in for good measure.  

There is a whole genre of Slavic fantasy (perpetuated often by writers with Slavic-centric, or nationalist views - regardless of the specific country of origin of the author: Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Serbia, etc...).  I am almost completely disinterested in it for various reasons (quality of writing being the primary concern, ideology of the authors being up there as well). Uprooted fits in that genre thematically really well, but probably stands tall as a much better-written book.  

(Obligatory obvious disclaimer: not all Eastern European fantasy writers write in this genre, so just saying "Russian fantasy" or "Polish fantasy" does not equate it to "Slavic-centric fantasy").

In fact, there have been something like three separate waves of white settlement in the Great Plains. The first began with the Homestead Act and ended in the first decades of the 20th Century as unclaimed land basically disappeared. The Dust Bowl (a man-made disaster, it should be noted), however, reversed the settlement pattern and drove huge numbers of farmers and ranchers out of the western states. In the aftermath of that, the federal government bought up vast tracts of abandoned farmland and created the modern national grasslands and public grazing system.

But, in the mid-20th century, two things happened that allowed people to move back into the rural west: Dam construction spread irrigation and electricity throughout the region, and rising energy prices in the 70s drove demand for oil and natural gas drilling. Farmers, ranchers, and oil workers came back to the Great Plains. But by the late 80s that trend had reversed, [and once again the west was losing population rapidly](http://www.lacusveris.com/The%20Hi-Line%20and%20the%20Yellowstone%20Trail/The%20Buffalo%20Commons/From%20Dust%20to%20Dust.shtml).

In the last decade, though, the natural gas boom has once again brought some population back to the region, but eventually we'll see the pattern return and the western states will lose population.

The reality is that most of the North American interior is just not suited to ranching or farming on this scale. It's an invitation for economic and environmental disaster, and each time the bottom falls out of the market we find ourselves with money and infrastructure invested in a region that cannot support the population we expected. It would likely be better for everyone except the large ranchers and farmers if we stopped subsidizing the endeavor and began returning most of the region to a more or less natural (or at least pre-colonization) state.

From the online sessions I have watched I prefer hour long videos, no background music, rules dont matter unless they are punishing the players or take to long for the players and audience to understand. The key is to find likeable players. I watched itmejp's long running dnd game for a long time despite the fact that the DM drove me nuts as an observer. Admittedly he was under unusual pressure but I don't think staying up for 40 hours on stream and then DMing is a responsible decision.

He is a lawyer by trade.  Thus, he has the specialized knowledge of how to change his name legally, as opposed to informally truncating the portion that is racially inflammatory.  However, he has not taken the initiative to make that change.  That tells me that he is proud to be named after people who risked their lives to try to justify keeping other human beings as slaves.  Further, I have absolutely no concern about whether anyone else shares my view.  I would rather be right than popular.

So, you like to look at naked women but don't find it sexual?

Pretty much when I've talked to women about wanting to see women naked their reaction is just "Why? They're just boobs, etc. you can see a million on the internet." For me, I think it's partly sexual but mostly curiosity and wanting to know people on a more intimate level. There's also the idea that it's not something you really want but it's more a desire you want to rid yourself of and the best way to do that is to just see their nudes and then carry on with your life. Celebs are a lot like that.

Apparently there was a bit more to it, that he said he was going to do a certain amount of angry reviews a month despite even falling behind on that at the time he said it. Now hes saying there wont be angry reviews until September-ish. 

In between all of it too hes lashed out at fans and went on twitter hissy fits over it which is part of what garnered more attention to whats going on.

I mean, which is it?  Are these restaurant employees hard workers who deserve more than minimum wage, or are they just doing the bare minimum and therefor deserve the bare minimum in pay?

The company just described their minimum wage workers as having, "constant dedication, loyalty, and continuous hard work" but to you, they still deserve the legal minimum payment.

[As far as Gallup says](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx), Americans at large are more or less perfectly willing to elect a Jewish candidate, but will not elect an atheist. Heck, only 64% of Dems would vote for an atheist candidate, while actually a larger share of Republicans than Dems (95% vs 92%) would be willing to vote for a Jew.

While the FAQ outlines the physical requirements to pass bmt, it does not elaborate on PT outside of the actual test, which I believe is what u/FindingTerraNova is asking about.

It is my understanding that you have dedicated PT for an hour or so 6 out of 7 days a week. (Source: [PDF](http://www.basictraining.af.mil/Portals/75/documents/Preparing%20for%20the%20Air%20Force/What%20To%20Expect-Jun%202016.pdf?ver=2016-09-09-142656-000) from [here](http://www.basictraining.af.mil/About-Us/Frequently-Asked-Questions/)

That said, as to how physically demanding basic training is outside of dedicated PT or the fitness testing, I have no idea, obviously. Perhaps someone who's been can answer your question.

I believe that the "Drop and give me 20!" stuff that you're talking about can be used as a punishment, but I have nothing to back this up, just a guess.

Thirsty Peter edit
I was, you know, walking the streets. Just walking, didn't want to make anything at all, just walk. Walking is good, healthy, I need to walk.

Also, I was listening to music. Nothing particular, just something to keep my mind working too. Nothing particular, but kept me entertained, so entertained that I didn't see that lady running on the other way. When we shocked, her papers flew through the air, falling all over. I got up, helped her to get up, and repack all the papers.

[Girl's point of view] I was in hurry, didn't even notice there was people around me. But he didn't notice me too, so it's not entirely my fault. He got me up and helped me to repack all the papers, then I thanked him, and went on my way again. I was going to court, present the defense of my client. When I got there, I noticed, and opened the folder, I noticed: the main paper wasn't there. Everything, but the document with his alibi. And we had already delayed the court for 2 weeks.

[Defendant's point of view] If I was mad? Of course I was fucking mad!, I payed that incompetent piece of shit to help me, and she "lost the paper". There I was, unjustly on jail, for a crime I didn't commit. Being mad would help me? No, it could just corrupt me and lock me even more in hate. I started reading on the jail. Not only for me, but started reading stories for the other prisoners (they didn't know how to read, most of them), from Nietzsche and other philosophers, to Douglas Adams. We all had a good fun. When I got out, I started writing too, specially motivational and inspirational books.

[*Someone that reads the Defendant's book*'s point of view] His book isn't really the best book I've ever read, but it made me think about how everything works. It'd not just wait and watch everyone try and make the difference, you need to be the different in you, and in others too. After this, I started seeing my employees differently, not just as someones that I payed money to make things, but as people that had lives, and people that they care about, and things they want to do. I was old, money wouldn't serve me anymore.

[*Someone that got a raise from the reader*'s point of view] I didn't get why he gave this raise to me, but all I could do was thank him. Even if it wasn't big deal, it helped me and my brother get out of the lame, and start to retake our own lives. 3 years ago, my wife died, and I'm still waiting for the governmental insurance, that I'm sure will never come. This money will help me finish my house (and pay the debt to the bank), and help my brother with his sickness.

[Brother's point of view] That was a really odd illness. I didn't understand what it was, all I remember was the doctor saying "Chronical", "Incurable", "Luckily treatable", and my brother explaining me there was a chance, but it was very expensive, more money than we could possibly see in our lives. His boss, god bless him, gave him a generous raise, and after about 6 months saving money of the raise, he got to take me to Singapore.

[Doctor's point of view] Seeing that little boy, with such a terrific disease, and the will of his brother to save him from it, really touched me. It wasn't a rich man coming to me to treat a random common illness that he got when he traveled to Australia, it was a really act of bravery and love. He insisted to pay me for the surgery, but I couldn't accept it. I proposed him a deal: I take the money, if he helped me to start a campaign for awareness and support for this disease, to spread how it's terrible, and help people throughout the world.

That was the problem with my (just now) ex.

We spooned alot but she was not really into getting touched or feeling my boner or anything, but I allways was  really hard the moment we layed in bed.
After some time it was just annoying for both of us, for me to lay there allways hard but never touched, and for her feeling my boner and my hands just sooner or later landing on her boobs, and if its just because thats the most comfortable place to hold them while spooning.

LHW is so thin these days. The last compelling fight I can think of is Rumble vs Jon Jones. Hell, I can't even name one LHW that has had a UFC fight, who has not been on the UFC roster for the past 3 years.

I am completely open about my exes with my current partners. Most of the time, I don't bring it up unless asked, but every once in a while, something reminds me of an ex and I might bring it up. That can run the gamut of warning the current SOs what my triggers are (and their source) to relating a funny story. My partners all know that I'm not pining for a long-lost love or still grieving the end of a relationship. In the same fashion, I hold space for them to tell me anything and everything they WANT to share about their exes. The relationships they've had in the past helped to make them into the people I love today.

And of course, your boyfriend is going to sound sad talking about his ex! That was a big part of his life and it seems like the end of that relationship was really painful for him. Instead of being upset or feeling threatened, rest easy in knowing he feels comfortable enough with you to show his vulnerabilities.

**Mr. Trump should not undo the protection of precious public land - The Washington Post**


MORE THAN a century ago, Congress gave the president extraordinary powers to protect precious public lands, in part to enable the White House to quickly preserve the Southwest’s Anasazi ruins from looters. Since then, presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to create scores of national monuments on hundreds of millions of acres. But a president has never tried to undo a national monument, and it is 


For that matter, it is unclear whether President Trump will try to do so. But there are ominous signs that he is considering at least shrinking protected areas. In an 


In fact, recent presidents have used the Antiquities Act ambitiously , but, for the most part, not in unprecedented ways. From the start, presidents used the act to preserve huge tracts of land. Teddy Roosevelt 


The Antiquities Act 


Mr. Obama 


There is much good in the Antiquities Act track record, because presidents, in their broad view of the national interest, have generally used their powers judiciously. Moreover, Congress has not been absent from this process. Very often it has ratified presidential actions, and at times it has checked the president’s use of the act, an interaction that restrains presidential abuse. Mr. Trump should keep this broad national interest, and long view, in mind.

こちらのメッセージボックスがfrom myoouの長文で埋まってるので、迷惑ですし、そろそろ控えて下さい

**数分置きに、こんな状況です**

**from myoou**

いいえ、あなたが統失の被害妄想を根拠に間違いを言いふらすのは黙ってみていられる状況ではありません

ぼくはtokoro10さんではありません

あなたは統失です

この2点を認めないかぎりmyoouはだまりません

こちらも見ず知らずの他人と同一人物視されていい気分ではありません

**from myoou**

それはあなたという特定の個人とやりとりしている以上僕の方も同じ状況です

何が嫌なんですか？自分が統失だというのは恥ずかしいですか？

それよりも統失ということを自覚せずに被害妄想を根拠にした言説をばらまいている方が有害で危険で恥ずかしいです

ぼくは一貫して「あなたは統失に見えます」とだけ主張しています

**from myoou**

いいえ、あなたは統失にしか見えません

病院に行って治療を受けてください

ぼくが言っているのは最初からこれだけです

匿名であるぼくの意見など何も信じなくていいので匿名ではない医者の言うことを信じてください

医者から統失ではないと診断されたならぜひそう主張してください

**from myoou**

myeeeuとmyoouは同一人物ですこれは間違いありません

他のIDはぼくではありません

したがって少なくともぼくの視点からは、あなたが二人以上の人間から統失認定されているということしか言えません（tokoro10さんとぼく）

これを信じなければおそらくあなたの信じられる事実はどこにもありません

あなたはひたすら自分の信じる道を征くのでしょう

**from myoou**

ぼくは「自分が常人である」とは発言していないしそう思っても居ません

「あなたが統失に見える」という主観的な事実だけを述べています

馬鹿にしたいわけではなくあなたはぼくの中では「自分が統失であると全力でアピールしたい人」にしかみえません

おそらくぼくを含めた複数人がそう感じているとぼくは思っています

そしてそのようである以上あなたの意見にはすべて被害妄想が含まれ得ます

自分の中から「こいつとこいつは自演」という認定を消して状況をシミュレートできますか？

**from myoou**

あらゆる書き込みが何らかの作戦や謀略の一環であると思っているならその認識は捨てるべきです

危険な考え方です

**from myoou**

ぼくはmyeeeuですけど、tokoro10tenの人とは同一人物じゃありません

同一人物だというのはあなたの勝手な思い込みです

ぼくはあなたが強い被害妄想を持っていると思っています

被害妄想は典型的な統合失調症の症例です

その他のあなたの文章からも強い統合失調症の雰囲気を感じます

あなたは病院に行くべきだと思います

EDIT：追記です

ぼくはmyeeeuですが、tokoro10tenの人と同一人物だと認識されているようです

信用出来ないならあとでmyeeeuのアカウントから同じように発言します（出先用のアカウントなので）

これはどう頑張っても間違いで、これが間違いである事実があなたの発言から説得力を失わせています

あなたの「同一人物による捨て垢粘着」という主張が被害妄想であるという根拠になってしまうからです

自分の中での「こいつらは同一人物である」という思い込みを一度捨ててください

何人から言われたのかわかりませんが、多数の人が「あなたは統失かもしれない」と思っていると思えませんか？

もう一度言います あなたは病院に行くべきです

病院に行ったことでぼくやtokoro10さんが困りますか？何かの謀略だと思っていますか？

そういうふうに思っているならなんともいえませんが、とにかく本当にお願いします

一度でいいので行ってみてください
&gt;Any rational person would update their models based on empirical evidence.

No one is that kind of rational. Seriously. No one.

&gt;I see no reason why I wouldn't change my assumptions afterwards. If anything, posting what I think will happen is a way of keeping myself accountable, it helps prevent confirmation bias in the future.

I agree with that and try to live up to it as well. I've noticed that people with your assumptions tend to be resistant to changing those assumptions when shown to be wrong. 

For example, its been rather fashionable in certain circles to confidently predict a collapse in the dollar due to QE. For instance, we see this in "economists" like Peter Schiff. The argument goes something like this:

We are printing too much money. That will cause hyperinflation and currency collapse. If it doesn't happen, its because the printing itself is preventing the collapse. But this can't go on indefinitely, so  it will collapse. 

This leads to an unfalsifiable claim. If the currency collapses, its because I'm right (even though that's not necessarily true). If it doesn't, I'm still right, it just hasn't happened yet, but it will! 

As you can see, this is playing tennis without the net. Its impossible to be wrong. Well as Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead.

Final Fantasy hasn't been "traditional" for well over a decade now. I think it's time to take a step back and understand that just because they're doing things you don't like, doesn't mean they're doing it just to generate hype by using the name. That doesn't make much sense.

I don't understand the venom people have for Horde? Dislike them for whatever reasons but step back and measure that hatred and if it becomes an obsession.. probably time to rethink your relationship with this game mentally.

Why is reddit down?
Read the Wikipedia article on Pankration. It was ancient Greek MMA that was held during the Olympic games. A guy won posthumously one time by making his opponent tap just as he died from a choke.
My biggest issue with Hollande (and Sarkozy, for that matter) is that he is happy to obliterate French sovereignty for European integration.  Hollande is not remotely a French nationalist, as he doesn't believe France should be a nation-state at all.  This goes against the very core of Gaullism, as a form of French nationalism.
Fresno State fan here, he also played in a weak conference and had the specter of his brothers colossal flop hanging over him. I'm actually really happy he's turning out so well, even if its with the raiders, but he could have just as easily been a bust. I still think he's got a long way to go.
Wyatt is fucking ruined.
*and over-driving conditions
It's been around since the 70s punk era, it's nothing new.
I know! I'm definitely not supporting the buy a dress and wear it once thing housewives do, but seriously.
I say this rhetorically but what exactly is the point of them at every pay-per-view going around and around with the 97 different foreign commentators there who really gives a shit I know it's all the show hey we're a global company etcetera but it's just stupid
Second or first?
THIS.  There's a reason /r/incels quotes show up so often on FSTDT.
Aye!
My wife just last night laughed at me for saying Aspergers when the neighbor was over.  " uh, honey, it's auspergers "all condescending like.  the neighbor corrected her,  I'm like,  so it's atism then?
sorry guys, i had to piss since the 4th and couldn't hold it anymore :(
Yeah, definitely. My mom used to call them 'tourons'. That kind of weird duality of "we need tourism to survive, but we also hate tourists" is definitely accurate, as is the bit about a lot of businesses needing to do well in the summer months to sustain themselves through the rest of the year.
That's not a problem with the method. That's a problem with some people on the internet. 

I prefer not to *assume* someone is going to read things the wrong way before I have any experience with them.
"...I think it's automatic. She hasn't slept in three years, I'm sure she's not possibly still maintaining it. Worth a shot, though."
Well, it's just so far to reach to do your own!
This is very similar to my story, I also got into them because of the cant stop video
You're definitely showing! It's great. There's nothing quite like having a big pregnant-esq belly.
Hi I am gonna have to pass on that cause she's the priority.  Thanks for the offer all the same
At least spell my name right.
You're right, it's not hard.  It's impossible.  What was I thinking?!?!  Vitamin B12 doesn't exist in any plant based protein.  Thank you for clarifying that for me.  Whew, almost made a big mistake in thinking maybe a vegan diet was for me...
Maybe Gary should wear a Thicc-Bit ;)
Annnnd followed.  Great stuff my man
That's my purse! I don't know you!
SOAR - Operate Hard Party Hard.

The hell you think we haul all that morphine for? (well, aside from selling half of it to the locals).
He probably crossfired them.
Probably baited for most of his kills
I feel u. He looks like he will die but this match against Punisher really showed me something. He's no world champ but he's got a role in ROH and it works.
Well clearly he likes it, he put a handle on the back of his head.
Rizzo, bet $5 on it.
Giving it a chance since it's not Bay finally. I love Transformers and am excited to see what a movie will be like without Bay even if it's shit.
The bandwagon has spread too far
Learning about other cultures history/origins/pains/triumphs from their perspective
A brewery tour I went on told us IBUs are a scale that maxes out at 100 because that's the limit of the human pallet. Any brewery that advertises a beer above 100 IBUs is just wasting hops that could go to a beer worth drinking.
the great irony is that you'll whine harder than anybody when it happens to you.
were they all gray or have you seen colored joycons versions?
You're thinking of the Food Lab's Two-Minute Mayo. The same technique can be used to make Hollandaise.

The real Hollandaise trick is to put in a Ziploc and use an immersion circulator to keep it warm until ready to serve.

In fact, this is a really good way to make eggs Benedict. Poach eggs in shell until done, using immersion circulator. Make Hollandaise as above. Cool off water to maybe 133 F (so as not to keep cooking eggs in Hollandaise), and leave eggs and Hollandaise in the pot. When guests arrive, fry up bacon/ham and toast English muffins. You'll be ready to serve in five minutes.
He's got an amazing filmography to his name, would be cool to see
I mean we have been talking about hiking and it's a common thing where we are at, so there are usually people on the trails but I am NOT at that stage to comfortably hike an advanced trail and carry on a conversation
That's what happens when you keep playing lady in red on repeat.
Have an acute lack of Riot Shotgun in FO4 right now.
I make one with the same flavors, I call it Thumper.

I don't sell, so if you like it have at it.
I've been thinking about this for some time and I don't see an obvious solution. I've asked a few of my peers and they can't solve it, either. (We are Junior/Senior level Electrical Engineering students)

The only way I can do it is with a double-pole switch, which is also a very common household switch.
Scary as hell situation. I had to do the Heimlich on guest that had choked on her lunch in the restaurant. At least it got us a good review.
They have. Because we can't see the console playerbase numbers people want to cling to the hope that somehow the games are doing fine on console when in reality they are far from fine on any platform.
Holiday looks lost
Thats because the redzone only spawns where players are.....
Not sure on that. The - spd is what makes vantage worse. Since you won't really be doubling. This is really why I made the post because there's a lot of theory crafting going on vantage is counter productive with the heavy blade aether build, but is just so strong with ranged counters. Then quick riposte works well with the heavy blade aether builds, but isn't really necessary on a fast ryoma. 

My Ike is +ATK/-spd. With those IVs I think quick riposte heavy blade aether could be really good. But I know vantage, fury, Luna/moonbow will also be really strong as well.  So I am personally unsure on taking the risk.
Marines are taught to take verbal abuser and have it roll down his back. If he can't manage that, then maybe Paul's right about him being a coward. I honestly had Cody pegged as one from Day 1 the way he ganged up on Josh unnecessarily and helped berate Megan out of the house.
Thanks. It is funny because I just saw that part at my college.
Beer them
No one size fits all answer will help you here. I went to a school for 1.5 years starting in 2005, went back to campus as a visitor in 2010, got a $20 ticket. They ran my plates which were different from when I'd been there, got my name, associated it to my email address which they still had, and for six years now I've gotten an email once a month invoicing me for $20 with a warning that fees or interest could accrue (none of which ever have). I owe that school other real money which has been sent into collection and yet I still get that email every month.
They really need Bliss to come out to a huge amount of balloons tomorrow night.
You have eight great grandparents. I don't know if "either" is the right word.
Not really. I think this is one drawback when it comes to shonen manga. They keep turning up the dial on powers to the point that it's flat out ridiculous even within the context of a fictional show. I like most of the intricate abilities of rinnegan but on Nagato's level. I don't like the Rinnegan's ability to bring back the dead on a massive scale and I don't like Naruto being able to conjure eyeballs out of thin air like he's Jesus Christ performing other miracles like inexplicably saving Guy from the 8th gate and stalling Obito's death just by touching them with his healing hands.
How is printing your own money "not even close " to borrowing money from a bank? Besides the fact that you will have to pay it back with interest.... 

Explain how it would cause hyperinflation and "destroy" an economy please.
Engrish?
It looks like the anime for Shukufuku wo has achieved its purpose with the first two novels popping up on this list.

I'm very happy NGNL is doing well, it's a great series.

Also, yay for Mushoku Tensei volume 9.
Just added an edit to specify that.
Is that a water heater in the next bay?
Among other things. Gary is just lackluster overall to be brutally honest.
Managed the fuck out the game.
What platform did it come out on?
This is crazy this video is saying millenials did not vote!

A post high up says they voted more than anyone

This is definitely true for my husband. I was quite happy with his dick when he was 400lbs. Now that he's 185lbs, I am *really* happy with his dick.
PA dutch country says yous. Philly just has a good bit of the dutch too.
So if you have an extremely small chance to hit that runner, runner, runner, runner out to the prison deck like Lantern Control youa re not allowed to concede.  The Lantern player then gets to dictate when they will employ their wincons against you to draw out game 1?

At what point are you allowed to concede this game to move on to the next game?  What if this was game 2 and you had won game 1 and you wanted more time to win the 3rd game?  What if it is game 2 and you lost the first game or the third game and you have such a miniscule chance of winning you want to concede to refresh for the next round or get lunch?

What is an acceptable reason for conceeding?  What is an acceptable time limit?  What if a spectator sees an on board solution that could lead you to winning but you don't?

Are these the sorts of situations that we want judges to be determining?
I call it shit.
I don't think Paul believed in any kind of original sin doctrine as exists today and believed men could be righteous.  Paul did say Jesus was under the law however which was a different thing entirely.  

Many people in the New Testament were called righteous which to me indicates viewed righteous according to their obedience to yahwehs laws.   Paul talked about Jesus' birth only to say he was of the right lineage to be king and that he was subject of the law.  No virgin birth story was necessary or known about in my opinion.  

Matthew was trying to tie Jesus into all kinds of Hebrew bible stories out of context though and may have originated his story himself or just competed with Luke's version.  

But then again what do I know.

"Three bowling lanes will be removed to allow more space for textbooks, and the coin-operated arcade games will be replaced by console games and a lounge area."

Maybe that means they will be keeping two of the bowling lanes?? That seems weird but I guess that would be better than nothing. What I really miss is playing unlimited arcade games for $8 on Monday nights :c
its a shit card for anything taht will come out late last year or this year and on, ASSUMING your expectations were to max everything out on 1080/1200.

it has a significantly relevant architectural problem regarding its VRAM which you can easily google. TR uses a large portion of VRAM in the cards.

tl;dr youre fucked on high textures with a 970
The thing is, as a rational being, we have an inherently immaterial aspect to ourselves - our consciousness. It should not be surprising that even in 2017 with all our advanced technology and understanding that we still do not even fundamentally understand what consciousness even *is*. Investigate the hard problem of consciousness. Examine the arguments of the aftermentioned Thomas Nagel, whose *qualia* effectively refuted materialist explanations of conscious experience ~40 years ago. And most of all look at James Ross' [Immaterial Aspects of Thought.](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/43151/ross-immateriality.pdf) That our consciousness is related to, but entirely dependent on a body can be demonstrated syllogistically (Ross) and it is therefore highly probable it survives death, even as a purely intellectual examination (to say nothing of divine revelation, NDEs, various reported experiences, and so on). And to say nothing further of St. Thomas Aquinas's position that to even comprehend transcendental qualities was enough to demonstrate the transcendence of the intellect (which he works out more in the *Summa Contra Gentiles*).

If there is a nail in any coffin it is in the materialist/reductionist view, and when the most brilliant living philosopher, himself an atheist, says so, I think you can pack your bags and go home. It is simply utterly untenable (not that any of that "proves" Catholicism, which is a separate question; more related in my previous post).
I like to also use avocado oil, but it's cheaper here in California.
If you would like to claim this post, please respond to this comment with the word `claiming` or `claim` in your response. I will automatically update the flair so that only one person is working on a post at any given time.

When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the will be marked as completed.

This is a(n) image post, so please use the following formatting:

---

**Art:**
---

A picture is worth a thousand words, though you definitely don't need to use that many to describe the image. Please attempt to just give a general idea of what the image is. For example, "A man and a woman sit in what appears to be a gondola. They are facing each other and are far away from the viewer. The lake that they are on glitters in the evening light of the setting sun behind them, and the deep blue and purple sky fills the rest of the image." Add as much detail as you feel is necessary.

---

**4chan &amp; Pictures of Text**
---

* When writing the Username and Timestamp headers in 4chan threads, only include the Username and day of the year if either changes.
* Standard 4chan header formatting (Military time is used, i.e. 4:20:00 PM is written as 16:20:00): **UsernameMcAnon**, 4/20/2017, 04:20:03
* Feel free to make spelling and grammar corrections if you truly believe that it will not significantly change the heart of the content, but include a disclaimer if you do.
* Regarding 4chan or other threads, it is always to the benefit of both the transcriber and the reader to find the original thread. Always try to find and include a link to it if possible.
* If there is quoted greentext like this:

&gt; be me, lvl 3 cleric 

&gt;surrounded by mind flayers

* ...then make the &gt; sections each a full paragraph break apart. Like so:

\&gt; be me, the Vice Head Transcriber  
{blank line}  
\&gt; writin' formatting advice all day long

**Note:**

Most of the 4chan greentexts are already archived online in their original state. A large percent of the time you can find the original post by going to Google and putting in one sentence from the greentext image inside double quotes; this will make Google search for the exact sentence. The more unique the sentence, the better luck you'll have in finding the original post. Then you can just copy / paste / format and it will go much quicker!


---

**Comics**
---

* Please ensure that any text in the picture is transcribed verbatim rather than just being paraphrased.
* Write the text and describe the scene in the rough order that it is intended to be seen. For example, if there is text at the top of the panel, then a scene in the center, then more text at the bottom of the panel, perhaps a punchline, write it like:

**Panel 1**

**Person:** This is a sentence that is going somewhere funny!

*(Description of the scene)*

**Person:** This is the punchline!

* In short, transcribe the picture so that the heart of the joke remains the same, and so the transcription would be as funny to read as the image of the comic.

bro did you not see what he was doing
Ayyyy lmao.

It's everywhere.
this is really sad, what's there to be scared of? Go explore and have an adventure.
Cool, thanks for the help.
What's Left of the Flag - Flogging Molly. I can barely listen to it without thinking of dying.
The dude who wrote Death of a Salesman
It's hard to believe people actually do that.. :/ so ridiculous! Do posts get removed when they get enough downvotes?
What kind of rhetoric? What kind of assertions are in a course description? Usually a course description includes a title, a a short list of the topics the course will explore, and a list of authors.
I'm on a trip to New York and the posters for this were one of the first things that I noticed when we arrived, like how is it that they can have all these people at the same event ! Who was your favorite ?
I said she needs love not being hit by horrible monsters constantly :(
The unreasonable effectiveness problem is the problem of mathematical structures studied by humans for their own sake—or for the sake of some specific application—turning up unexpectedly in other areas. It is no less surprising to find such structures in the mind of God than it is to find them in the world. 

To give an example: group theory was originally developed to study the problem of when polynomials had roots that could be expressed in radicals. It is then perhaps a mystery as to why it should turn out to be crucial in understanding particle physics—why is the universe beholden to this abstract structure we developed for unrelated purposes? But aha! says the theist, wonder no more: particle physics needs group theory because God used group theory to design it. However this just shifts the mystery onto why God used group theory to design particle physics—why is *God* beholden to this structure!?
By confronting it instead of letting it build up and haunt you, you can turn into a strength due to analysing why you feel guilt and  either  learning from the experience..or realising the guilt is unnecessary and you're just beating yourself up over nothing. Either way you turn it into  a source of strength and experience, instead of a weakness that will drag you down. A Very useful skill to have if you're apart of  a group like the shining  blade where you may have to do some morally questionable actions for the greater good.
The Dolores of the books is way worse than the movie Dolores, but my god did that actress portray her well. Wish the movies followed the books to a T.
Hardly any of those combos are the same. Earthshaker (werehog) got compared to a GoW combo that wasn't even the same at all. Same with many other shown werehog combos.

There are a few of the same combos, but hardly any of them are the same as a GoW combo.

These comparisons (in this industry in general) are counterproductive.
obvious throwaway for obvious reasons

but to answer your question

1. just hating myself in general, especially the way i look with a passion to the point where i would cry in the mirror and wish to badly be someone else, someone skinnier, still do

2. there way. once i hit underweight i realized "wow ok, i don't look good this skinny" but i still thought i was fat

3. realizing i wasn't happy with the way i looked. got weight restored on my own, ended up with bulimia months later and now heading towards a relapse.

I see 80 lbs for 3.60 (4.5 cents a pound) and 60 pounds for 3.25 (5.4 cents a pound) for plain old 4000 psi quikrete.  This is in chicago.  Bulk prices (which are well into 'call a truck, you idiot' quantities) are 2.88 and 2.28. Menards was 2.79 for 60 pounds of sackrete.

No but they're certainly encourage to have a very specific body type and aren't given many healthy ways to get to that body type
But we don't have the entire context of OP's situation. That's all I was pointing out, as you pointed out with the yelling, that this isn't a clear situation without more information. I'm definitely not claiming this situation is like that of those extreme examples and I get where you are coming from in that this situation isn't definitively an abusive one, but we also shouldn't assume control of children is never concerning behavior either (in this context or any other).

What about confidence issues? Especially for girls who have been fat since childhood or are unable to lose weight because "fat" is genetically their normal/healthy body size.

Our societies pretty much hand low-self esteem and depression to fat people on a silver platter. Which, ironically, can make it even more difficult for them to lose weight.

Nene Leakes on WWHL.
I was looking at the SPARQ scores of the guys we added through the draft and after, and it looks like we may have targeted some athletes this year (the Amichia pick especially sticks out).  SPARQ is a system designed by Nike to measure athleticism, each posistion has it's own z-score that is based on the average player at that position.  Better athletes tend to stick around the league, although obviously there's way more to it.  This helps clearly define measurable athletic ability though.

Our draft picks ranked at their posistion:

Kevin King, [CB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/cb/) - #1

Josh Jones, [S](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/ds/) - #7

Montravius Adams, [DL](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/dl/) #21

Vince Biegel, [Off-LOS Linebacker](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/lb/) - #35

Jamaal Williams, [RB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/rb/) - #45

Deangelo Yancey, [WR](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/wr/) - #33

Aaron Jones, [RB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/rb/) - #3

Kofi Amichia, [OL](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/ol/) - #1

Devante Mays, [RB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/rb/) - #18

Malachi Dupre, [WR](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/wr/) - #21

Notable UDFA scores:

[QB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/qb/) - Taysom Hill #2

[OL](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/ol/) - Thomas Evans - #7, Christian Schneider - #19, Geoff Gray - #20

[WR](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/wr/) - Montay Crockett #15

[LB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/lb/) - Cody Heiman #8

[CB](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/cb/) - David Rivers III - #34

It wasn't my own, personal story, but it's a story from my crazy ass family, so it's kinda my story. 

   My granddad and uncle were hunting fanatics, every December they'd go off for some deer hunting for a week or so. My uncle had a mild shit-curse on him whenever he went on these trips. Every time they came back, my uncle had a story about how he some how shit himself. My favourite was the collapsible toilet incident. 

My grandad had hoped to stop the shit-cidents by buying him a collapsible toilet (the four metal poles and a toilet seat set up). The first time my uncle used it, it broke mid wipe. He landed in his own shit, hand caught in the cross fire. They were out in the middle of the woods, no running water. So, my grandad handed off toilet paper to my uncle, while puking his guts out. The image still makes me giggle.

For the bear game, you can use whatever combination of three people you want. If you just say, "if x is a bear and y is a bear, then is z a bear?" No... the key is phrasing. 

You repeat the same three people in the same order, but you must start off your question this way, " ok, now listen... if x is a bear and y is a bear, is z a bear?" 

Yes! Because you said the word, "listen." 

It gets really frustrating for the new people if they don't get it right away and you just keep telling them that they need to "listen" and they'll get it

I was renting a house from some dead beat asshole and paying my $2000/month rent on time every month. 

6 months in i got a letter from the county that said  "this property will be auctioned on the steps of the courthouse on (date) at (time)." We had 2 weeks to get out.


My asshole landlord not only refused to fix anything wrong with the house, but also didnt pay his fucking mortgage with the rent i paid him.

And he got away with my $2000 security deposit.

Considering all the investment and rebuilding in the city (besides Poland being in the EU for over 10 years, Wrocław is one of the two 2016 European Capitals of Culture) it's increasingly more difficult to find abandoned buildings in the city.

I started with Redskins because of RGIII and once it was clear he was out the door I basically said "fuck this" and stopped supporting them.  
  
I then went to Raiders because I love LA and Cali (Cali is the mission) and went with Raiders because they're like the staple Cali team over here but I was honestly just waiting for a team in LA to comeback.  
  
Now obviously I'm on the Rams because they're LA. Lmao nothing special really.

Yeah I know how to tell em apart, its just been a while since I opened it up and I dont remember 100%.
Peterson says something else even more interesting on the topic of men and women in that lecture.

That men view women as the source of their self-consciousness (which is a form of suffering). We (women) make men self-conscious by rejecting them.

And that men who haven't dealt with that well are in a state of pathological resentment. Which of course we see the results of all over the internet with nice guys and some percentage of red pillers (don't know enough about them to say how many of them are in this camp).

So Peterson has already given you a way to understand why some amount of his fans are the way they are. They're a part of this resentful--and as you well observed--Eve-blaming category of men.

Which is also why Peterson is always preaching to men to become attractive to the opposite sex. Because men who don't do that don't have a good chance of resolving their resentments and becoming mature and responsible. 

Jung said he'd rather be Jung than a Jungian. And I'm guessing Peterson would rather be Peterson than one of his fans.

As for day driving, I haven't noticed the mirror being dark, so I must have gotten the camera mounted high enough.

Didn't get through as much reading as I would've liked to this month, but still managed to read at least a few books on my TBR list.

**Thud! (9/10)** and **Snuff (8/10)** - Terry Pratchett. After finishing **Night Watch** towards the end of last month, immediately went out and grabbed Thud! and Snuff. Sam Vimes' character arc has to be one of my all time favourites and although by Snuff his development is mostly complete, these last two books are a fantastic way to cap off an already stellar set of books. Absolutely loved the darker tones of the later books especially, with Thud! and Snuff being no different. Will use one of these in probably the sequel bingo square.

**Uprooted (8.5/10)**  - Naomi Novik. For some reason I've struggled to get into books that are written in first person recently, however after constantly hearing great things about Uprooted i decided to give it a shot. Took me about 100-150 pages to really start getting connected to the characters and the story but once I was hooked I couldn't put the book down. The atmosphere of the book was probably what caught my eye the most, the underlying sense of dread and despair felt by the Agnieszka trying to combat the Wood was brilliantly done. My only real slight criticism is something I've seen a mentioned a few times on here now, the romance in the book didn't really capture my attention all that well. It wasn't to the point where it detracted from the book at all but it was just wasn't a memorable part of the characters' journey's for me personally. Will be using this for my award winning bingo square.

About 150 pages into **Theft of Swords**- Michael J Sullivan and I was instantly hooked from the first chapter. Can already tell this will be a really fun read
Just get a knife and stab him Bray. A fridge won't do a thing.
Wow, thank you! Saved!

If/when I make it out there, I'll definitely check some of these out. The first one and Burkes appeals to me, as I love myself a good dive where ambiance comes first. I love all my fancy as shit beers and bourbons, but sometimes I just love to kick it in pretentious free bar where its all about the atmosphere and the people there. I'm just as fine drinking a Bourbon County Stout as am I sipping a PBR tallboy in relaxed bar.

I'm not a HUGE art person, but its something I like to do when I visit cities. Its a fun way to see the local culture on display. Though I'm kinda spoiled because I always assume art museums are free until I get there because we have a pretty incredible one in KC that also happens to be free (every day!). 

Thanks for the tips, you're awesome!

Used to work at a halfway house - we had cameras everywhere.  One time we were doing overnight, and me and a co-worker were talking and then we see a person walking down an ally right by our center.  One camera looked North, the other South.  Well we thought one of our residents was making a break for it so we watched to see who it was.  Well this fellow was walking down the ally, and about 20 feet from the camera he just stops and stares at the camera, but felt like he was staring at us.  It went on for about 15 seconds straight and we were both saying, "wtf, who the hell is that?  Should we go check?  Should we call our supervisor?"  Then he started walking again and we both agreed to see if we can see who it was before going to confront what we thought was our resident.  He went off camera and when we switched to the next one we didn't pick anything up, he just vanished.  The werid deal is that the ally was brick buildings on both sides.  No dumpsters, nothing.  He just literally fucking vanished.  After about 5 min of WTF moments I went and checked and there was no one out there.  Reviewed the tapes and still to this day have no idea who it was, what it was, or where they/it went.
I want to be you when I grow up.
Ye, i was trying to just keep it at 1 person. I only added two persons for Brook and Sanji for obvious reasons and in Nami's case. I feel like if she were asked who her favourite was, she would say Robin but we all know that's just her front. Her fav is def. Luffy.
Thanks a lot! I wasn't sure since the schematic didn't leave any information regarding voltage outside of the microprocessor.

Correctly? For your preference maybe, but outside of America people aren't scared of raw egg and would expect it to be a little runny/ at least soft in the middle.

 &gt;Imagine you have a contract over a payment of a fixed amount of Bitcoins in the future. Could be a mining contract, could be a salary contract, etc... But could also be your coins parked in a Bitcoin-bank (e.g. exchange wallet).

&gt;I guess these contracts are not prepared for the current case of a chain split. Especially when both sides claim they are "THE Bitcoin".

&gt;What is the legal solution in such cases?

&gt;I expect many more (small) forks originating from the latest Bitcoin UTXO to new alt coins instead of starting at a zero-distribution every time over and over again. So it is better to get the right understanding in the community as soon as possible.

I'm sorry, but I'm laughing so hard internally right now, because people are actually getting upset and going to the point of asking the creator to 'eliminate' people from the game who's betrayed them.

This is from the FBI. Did they handle the case or did D.C. Metro? If it was central to D.C., then FBI might not have records on it as they wouldn't need to.
&gt;Except it doesn't reveal three symbols, so you have to use that stand to figure out those

Those 3 symbols are primes that don't go into any of the other numbers present, so it COULDN'T have revealed them. As someone who loves math, the realization that those numbers had to be prime numbers and that they couldn't go into any of the other numbers actually made me appreciate the puzzle more, I'd never considered that someone might find that to be a hang-up.

Lots of fighters cut a fuckton of weight to make 155 because they wouldn't be competitive at 170 where you got MWs ducking their own division. That particular problem is prevalent in all division down from heavyweight, but it's most prevalent in 155.

Thanks for the input though.

I make banana soft serve at least once a week. It definitely has a banana taste - as it is just banana. Don't let that stop you from trying it though! You can totally mask the banana taste by trying different add ins. I've done cocoa powder, shredded coconut, banana, adding other frozen fruits, mint extract, shredded carrot (carrot cake!), cinnamon, and jam. 

Be sure to use extra spotty bananas, because yellow bananas are not going to be sweet enough.
Lmao this made me laugh
It only affected tournament players, and it coincided with a new format. Imagine if Wizards came out with "Core Set 2020" and announced "New format: Post-Modern. Legal sets: Core Set 2020 and onward."

Casual players didn't give a damn, at all, and that was the vast majority at the time.
Or you could do the right thing and tell them you didnt pay and ask whats up with the tracking. Be kinda dumb at this point not to since you made it public.

... what?
The spear is the way gives you 8% energy on fleetfoot m1's. So idk throw E &gt; Fleetfoot cast a couple m1's 2 m1's is enough energy for incap. Quite literally THEE earliest possible incap you can achieve, and it's AoE and castable on the move and all too ya know. Mind you, you've only thrown one spear., and not used your counter if you're accurate. 2nd spear landing if they jump away is also good. In addition there is a 1.2s root and +3 damage which would also apply to  EXE now, so your EXE now does more damage and roots also in round 1 which is a pretty good tool to use if you wanna be sticky

Round 2 the speed rite for fleet foot gives you the mobility needed to leave fights if need be. You get 1.3s of 50% MS in fleetfoot, another 1.5s out of it. You now have options to pursue, or evade much better than before. 

In addition both of the above rites are 100% useable with your EXspace, so in 2 swings you can not only self heal, and get a 65% movement speed buff instead of the standard 50% from having the second rite, but the 2 swings essentially also refunds your cost for casting the ex form.

Round 3 is chalk full of decent rites, up-to-6 hp heals is always good on Shifu. Not nearly as broken as it was, ik QQ more about brainless shifu mechanics. Tendon swing giving an additional 5% energy for landing means that if you land it, it's the only R ability that gives you a net-energy gain, the second instance of where an energy costing ability, if used properly will not only not cost shifu energy, but actually propel him forward in energy.  The 3rd, being a 3s cooldown for actually being accurate with spears, if you throw and land both spears, you knock off 60%  of the cooldown to a 3rd spear, which also makes you sticky, and if you suck dick at hitting moving targets, hitting walls works with this too. 

Round 4 20% spear length, or a 1.5s 25% movement speed haste for landing max charged m2's are both great great ways to stick to ranged hero's if I'm not mistaken

Round 5 speed spin... Uhh you ever hit immaterial and ult on Shifu with the fleet foot speed rites... It's a 100% movement speed immaterial whirling hurricane of death, which is heavily self promoted by the amount of energy gaining abilities shifu has that have an energy cost but when used well the cost is entirely mitigated, and actually gains you energy. They're hearding you toward being able to get more ultimates and use more ultimates and this shit in round 5 is a nightmare lol.

Given that they're not changing any of this shit, and giving him buffs in addition to all of it... I for one am willing to welcome my new Shifu overlords
there's a comment further up showing the inaccuracy with the awp from that far, i didn't know it could be that off. It is like a circle just bigger than a head on where the shot can hit

Iago from Othello is pretty complex. A lot of Shakespearean villains are very simple: they want power, they want to rule, and if somebody's in their way, they kill or neutralize him. We don't know how Hamlet's uncle feels about Old Hamlet, nor does it matter. We assume marrying the queen and ruling the country satisfies him. He is a villain of simple tastes.

Iago is more complicated than that. Sure, he wants power, he wants that position in the military that he thinks he deserves. But if he just wanted the promotion, he would've stopped after he got Cassio fired. He's after a very specific emotion. He wants both Cassio and Othello to feel the same powerlessness and isolation that he feels. He wants Cassio to know what it's like to lose Othello's favor just as Iago lost it. And he wants Othello to know what it's like to be second best, by making him feel like his wife loves someone else more. To achieve these things, Iago has to use far more than brute force. He has to manipulate people, get close to the people he hates most by pretending to love them, then betray them at the right moment. At times he has to use real emotions for false purposes. And he feels justified in this because from his point of view, they did the same thing to him. 

There's something very human about Iago. Not many people want to rule Scotland, but all of us have experienced envy and frustration and shame.
It's one of my biggest insecurities too. You're not alone. My mom lost most of her teeth before she was considered old. I had a root canal at age 9 or 10..very early in my life anyways. 

I'd like to blame it all on genetics but I can't pass the blame entirely from myself. I neglected proper care for a while when I was younger.
