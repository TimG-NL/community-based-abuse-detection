&gt;""During this period, mass culture and communication were instrumental in generating the modes of thought and behavior appropriate to a highly organized and massified social order. Thus, the Frankfurt school theory of the culture industry articulates a major historical shift to an era in which mass consumption and culture was indispensable to producing a consumer society based on homogeneous needs and desires for mass-produced products and a mass society based on social organization and homogeneity. It is culturally the era of highly controlled network radio and television, insipid top forty pop music, glossy Hollywood films, national magazines, and other mass-produced cultural artifacts""

A voltmeter will measure the voltage at the two points as the same, just as if it was a short circuiting wire.

But immediately, the plates become partly charged, which reduces the current flow and increases the voltage reading across the capacitor. In the ideal case, the voltage increases asymptotically to the voltage of the battery. That is, it never quite reaches the battery voltage, and the capacitor never becomes ""fully charged."" In practice, the current drops to near 0, and the voltage is pretty well the same as the battery.

For a large capacitor, this can take quite a long time, like an hour or so. To speed up the process, you can charge the capacitor with a higher voltage source at first, then hook up the charged capacitor to your battery. Make sure to get the polarity correct! The explosion can be quite dangerous.",nan

Kek, none of them 

Knowing them, there is no doubt that they play the ""main indian sub"" card to poach those amas. 

Those suckers are even copying whatever little we do on this sub. They started all those weekly threads and provided them sticky after we had been doing them for a while. One of the randimods even started posting RDD all of a sudden and stickied it when there was none posted from at least half a month. And when we were toying with the casual AMAs with redditors idea on RDDs, boom, they started doing it themselves within a week. 

I have absolutely no doubt they are trying to stop further leakage of non-political crowd to indiaspeaks",nan

Without opening my eyes I could tell it was Abaddon speaking to me. I was laying face down on the rug, and as warm as it was I had to pull myself together. 

“Is my family dead too?”

“Straight to the point I see, you didn’t seem to care too much about your family when you thought I was some random sexual encounter.”

“How dare you! I may not always show it, or act like it...But I love Jakob, and I love my kids.” 

“That’s why you cheat on him?” 

“It’s...complicated.” 

“It really isn’t, and besides, there’s no point in trying to convince me of anything. I know everything there is to know about you. You aren’t here to prove your innocence, because you aren’t innocent. You’re here because I have a deal for you. A deal that if you truly love your children, you can not refuse.”

 “What kind of deal is it?”

“Well, I should tell you this first, unfortunately your husband died on impact.”

“Oh my God.” 

I fell to my knees and wept, not holding anything back in front of this man who felt nothing relaying heartbreaking news. In fact he hasn’t stopped grinning since the second I opened my eyes. 

“How can you smile through all of this?”

“Oh it's nothing personal, believe me. I have to deal with so many of these stories that I have no room for tears anymore. I was once like you, I'm not actually the devil, well, not the original anyway. There are so many humans on the planet now that the real devil had to start using avatars to process all the damned souls. Heaven and Hell are a lot like the DMV. Actually it's a lot like mall Santa's, but we are all part of the real devil.”

“Who the hell would want a job like this? Who could stomach this awful responsibility.”

“That's actually a nice segue, Rose. You see, while your husband is dead, your two children are not.”

“Oh thank God.”

“First you blame him, now you're thanking him? No matter how many I see, I still can't believe how fickle people are. Yes, your children are alive, but them staying alive really depends on you at this point.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, let's go back to your other question. Who the hell would want a job like this? Right now, you would.”

“Why would I want this job?”

“If you don't take it, your children die. You were the only one who's meant to survive this crash. You also happen to possess every quality needed to be successful in this line of work. So think of it as a fair trade, a down payment for your services if you will. You work for the devil, Randy and Caroline live. It's a win win.”

“What do you mean by that? I am nothing like you. I have a heart.”

“It’s not about morality, and it’s not about right and wrong. It’s about what is, and what must be. You have an exceptional knack for lying. You would have to, to keep the countless affairs from your husband. You also have a lovely face, and a soothing voice. Making people feel comfortable in this kind of situation is a necessity. Most of all, you do truly love your children, and that is what’s going to make you accept this deal.”

“Why don't you let all three of us live? I can work here when I die naturally. That way everyone wins.”

He frowned, and then walked over to me and placed a hand on my cheek. 

“I'm afraid I don't win in that situation. As I’ve said, I was once like you. I was offered this deal, and now I'm working it off. For every soul I recruit to work here I get a year off of my sentence. FYI, if you save your kids, you get the remainder of the kids lifetimes as a sentence. And before you ask, yes, all deaths are predetermined.” 

“How long have you been doing this? And what happens after I fulfill my sentence?”

“I've been working longer than I can remember, and I can't answer the second question just yet. For now sit down and eat, contemplate this tough choice.”

“There's really nothing to think about.”

I brushed his hand away from my face and limped over to the table. 

“I have nothing to think about because my answer is obvious. My kids need to live. No matter what I have to do, I want my children to live.”

“So you're saying that no matter how long you have to work here, you'll sacrifice yourself for your children?”

“Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Just let Randy and Caroline live, please.” 

A broad smile spread across his face as he walked over and stood next to me.

“Wonderful Rose, but I'm sure you'll come to regret this decision. God knows I have.”

He snapped his fingers and a plain wooden door appeared behind him. It slowly creaked open and in walked an extremely small creature. Creature is the only accurate word to describe this knee high little devil. It’s skin was bright red, and it had the face of a goat, with large horns sprouting from the sides of its head. It flashed its jagged little teeth at me and I nearly threw up. The little creature was carrying a silver platter above it’s head, that had to be bigger than the creature itself. 

“Ah, thank you, Lump.”

Abaddon reached down and pulled the lid off the platter, revealing a contract written in beautifully flowing cursive, and an old style pen with some ink. He dipped the pen in the ink and handed it to me. 

“Just sign here at the bottom.”

I took the pen from him and quickly signed my name. 

“The living should really read these contracts before signing them. Oh well, at least I don't have to deal with another lawyer. “",nan

Only through regulations can capitalism be anything different. The middle class is an anomaly within capitalism, since it is created through regulation, otherwise it would be just a tiny sliver of working professionals (lawyers and doctors maybe, just the people who make a ton of money but don't come from old money).

If I was low plat I'd be playing with people who were gold last season. But I'm not. I'm literally only playing with high plats and low diamond.


&gt;What. Fucking. Vacuum.

&gt;What is math to you? Just a nuisance? A fairy tale? Here, why don't you take the chalk and do the math and prove your point. Oh wait. You can't.


applying math in a vacuum is when you dont apply basic logic to numbers. if you have 20 balloons and you want each person to have 3 balloons, you cant invite 6.66666667 people to your party, no you invite 6, because you can't get .6 of a person. Ignoring this is applying math in a vacuum. You're not adhering to logic.

Posts in /r/streetfighter must be related to Street Fighter directly and can't be about general FGC stuff, X looks like Y comparison meme posts, or other topics that just have SF as a title, etc. This is listed in our rules, [which you can read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetfighter/about/rules) and the original thread on the subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/2ylngv/rules_discussion/)

This means that any game that has Street Fighter characters and plays moderately like SF3, SF4, or SF5 is allowed! (example: CvS: yes, Marvel: no)

Please check out /r/fighters to see if you think your content is a better fit there for general FGC stuff or /r/gaming for an image macro friendly subreddit.

I only took myself, a friend, and a car-full of stuff to NC.

She eventually lost the house, and with it whatever random stuff I left behind that my dad couldn't salvage for me to bring to me later.

I had a poster tube full of things I drew and things people gave me, like an art print my favorite art teacher gave me. Gone. I've learned to get over it.

&gt;Statement from Donald J. Trump:
I don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech. Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:
“When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you (pointing to the audience). They’re not sending you (pointing again). They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us. They’re bringing drugs.They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people! But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people. It’s coming from more than Mexico.

* What is the maximum voltage?
* What is the voltage at the maximum power point of the generator? (depends a bit on the person riding the bike)

You should use a charge controller to charge the battery. A person on a bike will take a very very long time to charge a decent size marine battery, so overcharging is probably not an issue, this is just a much easier way to approach the problem.

You mention delivering a constant current to charge the battery. The constant current phase of charging a lead acid battery is a current ceiling to prevent the voltage across the battery from going above (approx) 14.4V (the battery will start to generate gas). You don't need the current to be constant, the battery will still charge fine if it is varying. The charge controller will limit the voltage across the battery when the charging reaches the constant voltage phase, this is where the charge controller is more important.

Don't worry about 'rapid changes in current', no changes in current or voltage from a person pedaling on a bike would be considered rapid in the electronics world.

I would recommend using a generator with a DC output.
If you knew the output voltage of the generator while at a comfortable riding pace, then I would look for a MPPT charge controller with a manual setting for the MPP. Set the MPP voltage to the generators output voltage at your comfortable riding speed. This will make charging the battery easier for the person doing the pedaling.",nan

I can't even begin to assess the deeper ramifications of such a change, beyond the obvious: it'll make the loss of Mech more punishing for DVa's team, and it'll mean more to get the enemy DVa out of her Mech.

This document describes us$650k used to fund two groups, PICO and the Center of Faith in Public Life, neither of which appear to be associated with Pope Francis. The Pope connection seems to revolve around his visit in 2015 and financing the groups to allow them to take advantage of that publicity to further their goals. 

I see Jonathan Soros' name a bunch, but George only mentioned once. I presume they are related?

The United States was now run by a brutal dictator who oppressed poor citizens such as myself.  I had the choice of going to prison for a long time or fighting to the death against four other criminals. I didn't want to go to prison at all. If I won the fight I would go free, so I figured I would take my chances. I'm 6'2 and 225 pounds of muscle so I thougt I could win.

We got to the room it was about 1000 feet by 1000 feet. It had a one way mirror where the elite family would watch from. The guards brought me in room. I was given a large kitchen blade. One by one four other men entered the room. They all had blades and they where all huge and muscular. ""Shit what have I gotten myself into"" I whispered to myself. 

DING. The bell rang and the fight had started. I retreated to the corner. Two guys were already down. The other two guys were wrestling. I got some courage and ran toward them. I stabbed the guy on top in the head. I couldn't get the knife out of the guys skull. ""SHIT"" I yelled. I backed up and pulled a knife off on the dead guys. The other guy ran toward me and tackled me. He tried to stab me in the head, but grabbed his arm and stopped him. He was strong. I knew I couldn't hold him much longer. I was covered in blood and ready to die. Then I said aloud ""let's not give them what they want."" He didn't let up. 

He said ""sorry, but if we stop they will kill us both and its better one of us survives."" I punched him in the face with my free hand. He collapsed to the floor. Now I was on top. I'm pushed his knife away from him. He realized he had been defeated. I didn't kill him.  I dropped my knife to the floor and sat. The guards came in. The two guards walked to me. Quickly and ferociously I slit both of their throats. I pulled the guns off the guards. I gave one to the other guy. We grabbed the keys off the guards then we walked to the entrance to get behind the one way mirror. We opened the door. We then saw the dictator and his wife

I wrote this book with a style of pacing that's more similar to a web serial than a traditional novel - that means there are a lot of lulls, as you mentioned, and some bursts of action here and there. It's not a traditional rising tension -&gt; climax structure, which was absolutely deliberate, but I can see why it wouldn't work for some readers.

Prose, pacing, characters, and humor are all about resonating between the author and the reader. This discussion has been interesting because it's interesting to see that I've accomplished that with some people much more than others, and in varying different places. The split between people who liked the school vs. the tower, for example, has been fascinating.

It's also been really interesting to see the split on people who did and didn't enjoy the style of humor. 

&gt; I haven't a clue what 'resh' is meant to relate to other than be an analogue for 'shit'.

I think human values emerge from the 'game' of life we play - meaning and emotion for us are value states and expected future reward for reinforcement learning - useful for selecting actions. 

Not at all, it's simply following instructions. If the instructions tell it to bang itself into a wall, it will do it. If the instructions say ""jump off this bridge"", it will do it. It will do anything its programming says to do, without reflecting. This doesn't reflect care, as it understood by heideggarians, care is what directs us to disclose meaningful (ready-to-hand) relationships between entities, hone skills, and 'unveil' the world without following rules or logic. This sort of 'care' is very difficult to understand in our western, materialist, cartesian culture - which very much believes that humans are merely biological machines following primitive desires and being controlled by our genes. All notions of free will, love, skill, and intuition are reduced to epiphenomenal occurences coinciding with brain activity that is the direct result of stimulus, nurture, and physical determinism. Human beings have no real freedom of will, they do only what their 'programming' tells them to do - this is an implicit belief for people who think we can create hard a.i. using representational schemas.

I suggest actually reading and studying some heidegger before being so dismissive of it and digging your heels into computational theories of mind (which I keep reminding people are entirely outdated nowadays anyway, if you still think the brain is a physical symbol system, you simply aren't up to speed with the latest in cognitive neuroscience).

&gt;meaning and emotion for us are value states and expected future reward for reinforcement learning

Just an asserted premise. This is not an obvious fact. To reduce all human activity to the 'anticipation of future rewards' is just naive darwinism. There are many things that humans do which cannot be predicated on future rewards, sacrificing yourself for ungrateful children - as just one example. If I am to take 'reward' as some tangible pleasure, something we can measure - then I just don't see it. Unless of course you balloon your concept of 'rewards' into something so ambigious and generic and empty that it just stops being scientific.

&gt;An AI placed in a similar context could rediscover human values.

You're confusing 'values' with logical facts. Human values are not based on brute, measurable facts. You might say ""well the reason you like Dinosaur jr over Weezer is because when you listen to one, you recieve more dopamine than when you listen to the other."" - but all you've done here is *added more facts*, because I can simply ask, ""well *why* do I recieve more dopamine listening to weezer? ""Well because your genetically predisposed towards it."" ""Why does one genetic structure release more dopamine than another?"" ""well, because..."" etcetera, we could just go on infinitely, you could pile more and more facts on top, but we will never arrive at *values*, just more facts.

If that argument wasn't clear enough, imagine the fact ""this surface is 39 degrees celsius"" - is this fact a *value*? Not at all, it's just a measurement. A physical state which we have represented logically by units of measure. This 'fact' cannot have any value in and of itself. It has '0' value, and adding more facts, with '0' values, does not ultimately create values.

1182,2016,2,czjfw5q,nan,AskPhysics,1458213931,0,2,0,"The problem is you are trying to apply Ohms law to capacitors, capacitors and inductors do not function in terms of ohms law, they depend on a difference in 'phase' between current and voltage.

So when you switch the 5 Volts across the capacitor that is not charged already, you will draw a lot of current at first and then as the capacitor reaches 5 volts across it, the current will reduce to zero (virtually zero anyway).

So it is about ""rate of change"" of voltage that determines the current through a capacitor. That is the reason capacitors block DC and pass AC, because AC has 'rate of change' and DC is DC (no rate of change). 

A way to think about caps in a circuit is that a capacitor does not like to see changes in voltage, and will supply current to stop that change.

Inversely, an inductor does not like to see changes in current, and they will change their voltage to stop the change in current.

So in a capacitor the current ""leads"" the voltage, and in an inductor the current lags the voltage.

A capacitor stores its energy in an electric field that is established on the plates of the capacitor, and inductor stores its energy in a magnetic field that is stores around the coils of the inductor.

But if you try to understand them in terms of Ohms law you will quickly get a little muddled.",nan

I think it'd be cool to have DPS single target healer that blends Zenyatta and Mercy but with a unique mechanic: Life as a resource healing.

The character would need to be tanky in some way (either with shields or just large amounts of HP) and has a short ranged powerful beam (I picture Mercy's beam in my head but red as fuck coming out of his/her hand).

When targeting the enemy it will rapidly drain their HP (before shields and armour...which'd be weird) and heal itself. If it shoots an ally it will rapidly heal the ally while draining its own HP.

Now, the first thing you'd think is that such a character would be a massive fire magnet so there has to be some considerations. Firstly it should do enough damage that anyone stupid enough to get into mid-short range combat should pretty much guarantee their death, however teaming up would be fine.

The character would need to either have some sort of maneuverability techniques or at least a temporary shielding/damage immunity skill of sorts.

Finally the ulti should 100% be a vampiric aura, all allies in LoS gain like 20% damage as health whenever for 8 seconds.

Don't get hit.  Do you see a destroyer?  No?  Take evasive maneuvers anyway.  Do you see torpedoes?  No?  Take evasive maneuvers anyway.

Are you by yourself, far from friendly ships?  What are you doing out there?

You know what's really, really frustrating when I'm in a DD?

When my torpedoes keep missing enemy BBs because they keep changing speed and course, and when I can't get close enough to an enemy BB without being spotted by planes, cruisers, or a screening DD I didn't know was there.  Torpedoes are so slow.  They take so long to get there!  The enemy has so many chances to evade them that I simply must pray that the captain of the enemy BB is unlucky or not paying attention and that their team is uncoordinated.

But if you end up getting chased by a DD, sometimes you're just screwed.  If that situation sets up and there are no friendly ships to chase off the little pest, the DD has arranged the prerequisite conditions for victory.  Small, fast ships with torpedoes are a counter to battleships.  Meeting your counter can be unpleasant.

...Although if you're in a Fusō with HE loaded or you're in a Nagato and making them chase you through secondary fire, the destroyer's victory is hardly guaranteed despite favorable circumstances :D",nan

""Only Neo-Darwinians, what few are left of them, still try to make evolution about “species” or “populations”. Evolution is organismal and entirely within organisms. It is about how change causes diversity and increased complexity in the biosphere, not about static populations in a static environment staying the same for long periods of time. Evolution causes selection, not the other way around. You are reversing cause and effect, a flagrant chronological order problem.

Trying to mix stasis with evolution is what is confusing the discussion. It isn’t a matter of whether we break down the scale to individual nucleotides in one individual or the entire population of the earth. The point is you can’t conflate stasis with evolution as if they are the same thing. If you want to discuss populations, fine, as long as you can distinguish change from stasis. Anyone saying “evolution by selection” is confusing the cause of stasis as if it could be a cause of evolution. Its like saying “working hard gets you money and allows you to take vacations to relax, therefore, vacations make you money.”

The examples I gave may have been lost on you, but they were intended to show that proliferation is NOT required for evolution. An endangered species is just as much evolved and evolving as it would be if it were more predominant in the population. Out of 10 to the 40th power living organisms in 4 billion years, 10 to the 39.5 have been bacteria. They outnumber even our own cells within our own bodies some 10 to 1, yet they are almost identical to the ancient bacterial genome. On the other hand, as evolved as elephants are, their population is minimal. Population percentages and evolution are two related but quite different topics. You are just not being relevant to the conversation of evolution.

I had to laugh imagining your alleged groups of scientists sitting around asking if they think traits beneficial to survival would proliferate or not. Laypersons on Quora talk about “it conferred an advantage, thus it exists” but few scientists blow that kind of non-explanatory hot air.

Actual scientists talk about genoplasticity, transposons, polyploidy, hybridization, duplications, deletions, activation and silencing, symbiosis, frameshifting, transcription factors, environmental monitoring systems, homeostatic regulatory systems, intercellular signaling, extracellular vesicles of genetic elements, codons, horizontal genetic transfer, chromosomal fusion events, DNA repair mechanisms and epigenetic methylation, histone modification and nuclear localization, not to mention the study of precise molecular folding and allosteric sites on complex proteins.

No scientists in THIS century are interested in “competition for limited resources” as a faux cause of evolution. They just can’t dumb down that far anymore.""",nan

It is mostly accurate that she won't or can't ""remember"" the beating she got the day before, because of how her brain operates, which is always the clock analogy I mentioned.

Outcome independence is also a separate issue from the that, because it's a male drive or action and not dependent on whatever insane shit she can rationalize. If you thump her with a bat she will crave it more and have no intention of leaving so the IDGF attitude just magnifies everything in her warped mind which is why the female will never leave the abuser, and that ties into the ""I can change him"" attitude which is also running at the same time.

Starting on slide 15, she gives examples of 2D parity. I'll write them here for convenience:

Original data 1100111 1011101 0111001 0101001 are split into lines, and you take the parity both horizontally and vertically. The parity of course is just the XOR of those bits so the vertical or horizontal strip has an even number of 1s.

 | data | row parity
:- | -: |-:
data | 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 | 1
data | 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 | 1
data | 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 | 0
data | 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 | 1
column parity |  0 1 0 1 0 1 0 | 1

When you transmit, you'll add the row parity to each block, and you'll also send the additional final block: 1100111*1* 1011101*1* 0111001*0* 0101001*1* *01010101*.

If you change a single bit anywhere, the mismatching parity in both the row and column means you can pinpoint the exact error and fix it (you know the parity is wrong when there's an odd number of 1s in a strip). But can you change two bits such that the error is detectable but not fixable? Basically you need to break our ability to pinpoint the exact position.",nan

1366,2017,8,dkzsrm2,nan,AskReddit,1503657057,0,0,0,"I went to an American high school, and am at university in Canada now. In high school, people just seemed to do things with the sole purpose of writing them on their resumes. I was exceedingly difficult to make meaningful contributions to groups because they were stacked full of uninterested people and run by people who each ran 8 other service clubs and couldn't care less because they got their title.

In university, and I don't know if its because people have grown up, or if it's because it's a different country, but people are much more selective in what they do, and they mostly do it because they enjoy it or because they care. Getting those volunteer and leadership experiences are much more organic, and people aren't really doing it as resume padding from my experience.

But that last sentence is too real. It just about kills me when the employers are like ""we want risk-takers, who can do exactly as they're told, and take no risks.""",nan

**After** Service Pack 2.  Some even say Service Pack 3 wasn't that great.

The initial release of XP was buggy as all hell, and had so many back door vulnerabilities the Village People thought it was a little bit promiscuous.

In regards to your question: Drawbacks

* A cursory glance at the Microsoft Website sees that Service Pack 3 for XP is no longer available.  You'd need to go to a third party website to download the service pack.

* XP is no longer supported, this means

Any new vulnerabilities discovered will not be patched

Any issue you have with drivers, programmes, whatever not working are you own.  You're probably just going to have to accept that it just won't work.


* You may find it hard to get driver support for your hardware - most definitely if it was released post XP support shutting down

They can do this because they're well-funded (as opposed to candidates Rick Perry and Scott Walker who dropped out early). When the primaries and caucuses take place, there's hard evidence that their campaigns won't succeed. Funding dries up and they generally drop out and endorse a remaining candidate.

I can't tell you O'Malley's thinking but presidential candidates are generally assertive, type A people who have been ""on top"" for much of their careers. They're surrounded by yes-men who tell them how wonderful they are and that they should run for president. It's just not in their ego to quit. If I had to speculate I'd say O'Malley is hanging on to press issues that are important to him, or to attack Clinton from the left and force her to take more left-leaning positions than she would if she had no serious competition for the nomination. Clinton has presented herself as the inevitable Democratic nominee during both her presidential campaigns. Dems don't like being told a candidate is inevitable. It's a challenge to them.

You and your mates are riding like a pack of fools. You made multiple surrounding and intimidating maneuvers and pissed off more than one vehicle in the short space of your doctored video. 

How about learn how to ride like an adult. Or expect to come off your bike sooner rather than later. 

If you did that to me in Australia id get out of my car and beat you with a club lock and other vehicles would probably join in. 

You're a dickhead, you ride like dickheads so don't cry when you're treated like one.

1453,2016,2,czjaj98,nan,AskReddit,1458211336,0,4,0,"**Tuition costs**: when I was in high school, more than half the kids graduating went to trade school instead of college. And the degrees in college were degrees in subjects that actually related to careers, like aerospace engineering or pharmacology. I have a niece who is a Performing Arts major and her boyfriend is graduating this year with a degree in Linguistic Anthropology. How on Earth are either of those degrees going to turn into careers, let alone provide a background for a job that will pay off the ridiculous cost of such fluff?

**Low wages**: That's a side effect of having an unmarketable degree and no skills that people will pay money for. Unskilled labor doesn't earn high wages, and never has -- even back in the Boomer days. If you want to make money, learn a skill that people want to pay money for. And there's no shame in learning a trade. Learn plumbing or carpentry or roofing or electrical wiring, and you'll never want for a good paying job. 

**Housing**: it's always up and down, and over time it's a great investment. If it's too expensive where you live, move to a less expensive region, like the Southeast or Nevada. Unless you're on parole, the only thing stopping you from leaving town is your own mental inertia. Strike out to new locales and find better living conditions. 

**1099 employees**: Go a step further - - form an LLC and go corp-to-corp. I've been my own boss for 15 years now, and the idea of working for someone else now and listening to all the nonsense about wondering whether you're going to get a raise or get laid off or get your benefits cut is so ridiculous to me now, I can't believe I put up with it all those years. There is no advantage to making money for someone else. Be your own boss as soon as you can, and you can set your own salary and decide on your own benefits. ",nan

I study brain activity during certain mental states, which helps me understand what I'm capable of. Basically, when you're furious, the lights turn off in the front of your brain, b where all your communication, reasoning, and empathy lie. Pretty much all that's working is your brain stem, so you're essentially an angry lizard at that point. Nothing really beneficial is going to happen if my husband is trying to talk sense into an angry lizard, or vice versa. So we just chill down until our other parts of our cognition come back online and we can have a productive conversation. 

Knowing this also helps me with my children. If they are freaking out, I never bother trying to get them to listen or do what I want or whatever. It never, every works because they are neurologically incapable of doing it. I calm them down first, and then talk. 

And honestly, the idea of myself as an angry lizard is so funny to me, that just remembering that that's the mental state I am in in that moment can sometimes be enough to help me snap out of it. ",nan

You can play and enjoy IJ2 without ever buying the DLC. In my opinion there is a subset of gamers that have just gotten greedy and continue to demand more from developers while wanting them to keep the price the same. 

I say this as someone who bought the ultimate pack without expecting anything extra than what was in it because Developing and balancing characters takes time and money.

I love all three very much but I've never felt as connected to my companions as I did in DAII. The way each character's story arc pans out and the amount of character development they go through is just amazing. It's so much more realistic than doing one quest, making a huge decision on behalf of your companion and somehow shaping their entire future (or even personality, in some cases) through one action. I love how each companion in II grows so realistically over ten years and they don't just listen to whatever you tell them. It really makes them feel like Hawk's family and not just her posse.",nan

Option 2: Roger Ver does understand that disk space usage is a straw man argument, but would like his audience to believe it is a valid argument against the scaling roadmap and will increase the hatred and animosity towards the core developers. This would be an example of social engineering.

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Funny story, about PokeMMO. I have 7 friends that play it. They tried to introduce me (a PC-Pokemon noob ) into the game. I watched the how to install video on youtube and without noticing a video about P.R.O started autoplaying. I was blown away, I started asking my friends all about it (still thinking it was PokeMMO ) and nothing matched up eventually I found out I was watching a P.R.O video and not a P.MMO one.

That was on the same day I decided I was going where my eyes were aesthetically pleased. All 7 of my friends now play pro. 

I know this doesn't exactly answer your question, but almost 300 hours in a months time.  That's longer then I've played fallout 4, and Skyrim combined. This game is simply doing everything right. I absolutely love it.  If I couldn't play P.R.O, I wouldn't play any of them. End of story.

Sub-prime is by definition risky. Being risky is what qualifies it to be subprime in the first place. 

Your own definition in that context is irrelevant--underwriters assess the means and credit worthiness of candidates, and those who pose a risk outside the 'prime' zone are sub-prime lending.

Sub-prime lending is risky, which is why it contains the larger coupon compared to prime lending. 

&gt; No bank will lend to you if you tell them truthfully that you have a 50% chance of bankruptcy.

A few years ago they would loan to you if you had no income, job, or assets (NINJA) because they believed the asset (homes) were guaranteed collateral that would turn a profit whether or not the buyer could afford the payment.

Banks have all kinds of motivations to make loans, and prudence or responsibility aren't always the most important ones. ",nan

Best Overall Ninjustu: Sasuke. Like, sharingan + rinnegan, c'mon.

Best Taijustsu: Guy. 8 gates and stuff, totally wrecked Madara. 

Best Genjustu: Shisui, just because he has what's supposed to be the strongest genjutsu period.

Best Jinchuuriki: Naruto, because he befriended the beasts and is the jinchuriki for them all now.

Best Bijuu: Isobu. Marginally. Totally biased, but just because the backstory with Yagura and Rin is cool, and he ended up with Naruto. Plus, he's just this cool water-style-ly thing.

Best Character Growth: Sakura. For me honestly, she went from a totally whiny bitch to still a whiny bitch, but also useful.

Best Arc: Pain's Assault. Explanatory!

Best Villian: Madara, because he seemed like a legit/undefeatable threat at the end.

Someone else suggested OpenVPN and I liked that idea too. I will implement OpenVPN and maybe some other technology if necessary.

Plugins and scripts will be available

Moving torrents while downloading or seeding shouldnt be a problem.

I totally agree with your priority. CPU, RAM and HDD are a big concern, specially server side. Currently writting the code in C++ and being VERY careful to do things efficiently.

Sequential download and therefore streaming files while downloading will be a feature.

I have used RClone before. Thats a great project and would fit nicely for this pourpose. The idea is to make a lightweight client, so I dont think its a good idea to add this to the core program, however this could easily be done through a plugin or scripts.

This last one is tricky. Doing so may appear simple, but it actually is not. This would need a totally different program just to communicate with those clients. Also, efficiency has it's price and  a web interface that communicates with different torrent clients would probably have its efficiency decreased.

Everyone knows a marine should be much taller, stronger, durable, and be far more deadly.  A marine shouldn't have the worth of 3 guardsmen - but at the same time, they can't just re-write the way marines have worked, or retcon them entirely or they risk people being pissed off that their old armies (due to size, or equipment, etc.) is outdated.

I can see these guys being a new army in the forces of the imperium. I doubt they are going to be just a type of space marine, but instead, the 'new generation' space marine. With the new system, perhaps they will get 2 wounds, or higher strength. Maybe their basic transport will actual make sense (i.e. rhinos not being able to hold 10 marines in your wildest dreams).  I think GW learned from Age of Sigmar in that they can't ever hard reboot a setting without losing people (although I'd argue fantasy has more players now than it did before, but I don't even want to get into that, and risking something like that with 40k is far more eggs in the basket) - but they can soft reboot it.  Make it so that the new marines are way more appealing, and cool. Slowly pull people out of the old stuff, and into the new stuff.

I appreciate all the responses.  I think what I'm most interested in here is this: do you trust the yeast labs?  I do.  When White Labs specifically calls out ""does not ferment well below 62"", I listen.  Well, if I read that before I brew, I listen (lesson learned).  As it turns out the WLP 029 is from PJ Fruh in Cologne, while 2565 is from Weihenstephan.  These are different yeasts.  Many of the responses here don't even include which strain the poster is using, just assuming all Kolsch yeasts are the same (which is what I did until I looked into it!).  

So I think this whole post is part question, part PSA.  These Kolsch yeasts are not the same.  They respond differently to fermentation conditions, and I experienced that... twice.  My experience what consistent with White Labs' documentation.  

Have any of you experienced that?  Do you trust the parameters the yeast labs provide?  Just curious.

As long as it's fairly constant and doesn't suddenly let people teleport or do something out of character. 

Yep. You nailed it on the last part. In the comics that portray him correctly that's pretty much what has to happen. They try to reduce or greatly increase gravity (cuz he's strong but he's not superman, put him on a spot where it's 30x gravity and he's going to be almost unable to move). The Flash is one of the most powerful beings in the D.C. Universe.

Look at quicksilver from xmen. Cool stuff right? He's like the rc car compared to the Ferrari that is the Flash. He's on a whole different level of speed, to the point where he can literally go back in time on accident if he's not careful lol",nan

*****
&gt; Fifty years ago today, the Soviet space program launched Luna 9, the first spacecraft ever to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, or any extraterrestrial world for that matter.

&gt; You would think that in the midst of the Soviet Union&amp;#039;s intense rivalry with the United States, its leaders would want to flaunt the first postcards from the Moon, taken by a Soviet lander.

&gt; British newspapers scooped the Soviet press on their own Moon landing, and images from the surface were rapidly disseminated outside the USSR&amp;#039;s borders several days before the average Soviet citizen had access to them.

Her Enchanted Forest Chronicles, especially the first book Dealing with Dragons, are excellent fun.

2054,2017,8,dkzoyf6,nan,Games,1503655039,0,0,0,"**Castlevania: Order of Ecclessia** Even with all that indie Metroidvania boom, I'm still finding myself returning to old 2D Castlevania games. Glad I did that because Order of Ecclesia is a damn good game. At first I didn't like some of the new ideas like overworld map but after a while got warmed to them. The game is also gorgeous for a DS game with beautiful animations and sprites. I feel people interested in Metroidvania platformers should definitely give DS Castlevania games a chance since even today they still remain among the best of the genre. Shame Konami is not making them anymore. R.I.P. Castlevania.

**Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright** Not enjoyed it as much as I expected. It feels more like DLC to the Awakening than a proper new entry to be honest. Lots of shoehorned and fanservice elements like marriages, children, sauna and house invitation stuff. Also found the castle feature pretty pointless. As positives the cinematics look great as before, the cast is decent with good support conversations and anime artwork is nice. Balance is also way better compared to Awakening so there are less ways to break the game and trivialise it. That said, I forced myself to finish the last couple of missions. I was planning to play Conquest after finishing Birthright but at this point I feel a bit burned out. Will still give it a chance later on.

**Heartstone** Ever asked yourself what happens when a Legend rank, 6-7 Arena win average Beta-Naxx Heartstone player returns to the game? The answer is he gets destroyed. It was so brutal at start that I burnt all of my gold amounting to 3K in Arena in a very rapid fashion accompanied by rage-inducing BM from my opponents. Fortunately I got the hang of Arena meta with the help of that stupid addon called Heartarena and climbed to 5.0 winrate including free wins of late. Managed to craft two competitive meta decks and tried my chances in ranked as well but I gave up  after I realized it's gonna be a long grind to legend for nothing at all really. All in all I already started to lose interest in the game again since I realised what made me quit the game at the time of Naxx is still present.

**Heartstone Rant** First, Arena is completely unbalanced since some classes like Mage have better chances of building functional good decks on top of having a OP hero power for Arena. Aside from that sometimes RNG screws you so hard at drafting phase that you are forced to play a curve/tempo/minion deck without spells, combos, synergy etc. Those decks can win games of course but they are so boring to play that they sap the life out of me. This applies to ranked and other modes as well but I feel the amount of RNG in this game became just ridicilous especially with the addition of discovery and other RNG mechanics. From what I can gather, Blizzard increases RNG elements to make their games more casual friendly and prevent the gap between hardcore and casual players becoming too large (they pulled a similar trick in WoW with RNG legendaries and forges). Their approach is probably genius from business side of things but doubt same thing can be said when it comes to game design. Last of all, I think the game is still too stingy when it comes to rewards and its business model. It's a F2P game but only if you try really hard (you are better off working and spending real money instead of trying to earn valuables in game). I feel their approach is just scumbaggy because you don't necessarily need to starve players to make money since the majority of the income will come from whales and they are luxury spenders so they will spend their money whether they are starved or not.

(I'd been her corrés when I was 15, but got sick at 16 so she couldn't stay with me the following year when she came to the US, so she came to visit during the summer when I was 17) 

She was so confused, because apparently corn on the cob is only a food for farm animals, and any corn they ate was canned or frozen kernels. 
She loved it though. Kind of have to have fresh summertime corn on the cob when in Illinois! 

She also was weirded out by the water. She's from Grenoble, one of the few cities in the French Alps that has basically mountain spring water from their taps. It's amazing. 
She mentioned how odd our tap water was and that it smelled strange. Apparently the fluoride tasted weird along with the small amounts of sulfur making it smell. This is Lake Michigan water, it's some of the best tap water in the Midwest. 

Something I've noticed since I moved to rural Alaska, my fiancé was raised within a community where the second language is Alaskan Yup'ik. So he'll say a word and I'll be confused, and only then does he realize that that particular word is actually a Yup'ik word and not an English one. Pretty neat actually. We always say 'Kenkamken' as it means 'I love you' in Yup'ik. 
Some words he didn't know weren't English; Nuq (basically poop) amuq (boob) stooks (claws) balalook (maggot) balook (type of tree fungus) 
Of course I wrote them all phonetically as I'm not sure the correct spelling. I've been told that there isn't much of a written record of Yup'ik as it's one of those languages that's passed down orally, so it's often written phonetically afaik. ",nan

Okay, so from what I remember War Doctor activates a weapon (also Bad Wolf is there) that somehow gets him, 10 and 11 together. Shenanigans happen, then these 3 and previous Doctors help save Gallifrey (including Capaldi). After they save the planet and return to that museum, someone says something about after they split up no one will remember, for some reason. Now I don't remember the particular reason, I think something about timelines being out of sync, but my issue was with how they explained why War Doctor and 10 (and subsequently all previous iterations) don't remember any of this seemed kinda weak. It's a minor issue really, but the did need a reason to not remember so alright then.

Hmmmm. That's true, especially since they want out later.

2137,2016,2,czjgc3l,nan,GGdiscussion,1458214139,0,1,0,"So we're to conclude that, dealing with a highly vocal trans activist, constantly talking about trans issues, who looks distinctly like she's not biologically female, and has a visible Adam's apple, there's a reasonable likelihood that she has a rare medical condition and the rest is purely coincidence?  While that would be a theoretical ideal of openminded rationality, people simply don't WORK that way.

Consequently, I don't think it was Milo's intent to out anyone when he wrote that piece, I think he just believed he was discussing something people already knew was the case.  In fact his article writes extensively about Brianna's past disastrous involvement in online transgender communities, and quotes statements she had made in 2007 publicly referring to herself as transsexual.  Ergo, Milo did not out her, she was already out, Milo simply connected her to past actions.  I do not believe that a person online somehow has the right to be publicly out, reinvent themselves under a new online persona, then accuse someone of having outed them simply by connecting their current online activities to their real, out, identity.  As I said before, this can be argued to be doxxing, but it's not outing.

I will not deny that Milo wrote a hitpiece pandering to the schadenfreude of certain sections of GamerGate to see a bitter enemy taken down a peg, I won't deny there are ethical issues, but there are also justifications in that Brianna is a flagrantly dishonest bad actor, at least in the opinions of most GGers and frankly even a lot of antis who are sick of her crap, and exposes on the chicanery of dishonest individuals are hardly new, or inherently unethical.  That said, I find Milo's attitudes on transgender people deplorable and the focus of his article on irrelevant information meant to embarrass rather than discredit her.  You might be surprised how many GGers think as I do, Milo is quite polarizing within GG circles, he's not nearly as universally loved as antis seem to believe.

So yes, he did a bad thing, and yes, many GGers, some out of bigotry, some out of anger or spite, cheered him on as he did it.  But it wasn't SO BAD that I'm willing to condemn the whole movement over it, just encourage my peers to be bigger people in the future, listen to the angels on our shoulders, not the bleached-blonde devils.",nan

Ideally you should not blindly throw around figures, especially those that come from political advocacy organizations like OxFam, without understanding what they mean. The claim you're citing is that at some point in the past, on average UK corporations in all industries returned 10% of profits to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, and that now that figure is 70%.

There are at least three problems with your use of that claim to debunk the aforementioned investor's complaint. First, the investor was talking about the US airline industry, not UK corporations in general. You have no idea whether the same is true in the US airline industry.

More importantly, the OxFam claim is about what happens to profits, and the investor is complaining that profits will be low. Even if 70% of profits are returned as dividends, 70% of a very small profit could reasonably be called ""leftovers,"" e.g. if labor gets 30% of revenues and investors get 2%.

Finally, in general investors don't necessarily care that much about dividends vs. reinvested earnings. If a corporation can reinvest earnings profitably, in a way that causes the company to grow and increases its stock price, that's still good for investors, because they have the option to sell the stock for capital gains. Usually, dividends and buybacks are only in investors' interest when the corporation cannot profitably reinvest all of its profits.

I have no idea whether the investor's complaint is valid, but the statistic you cited certainly doesn't prove that it isn't.",nan

2. Saying an amendment = abolition is flat out wrong. 

3. Libel laws should be expanded. There should be a small fine for first time offenders that ramps up after that. If you post legitimate fake news, like saying the president pissed on someone with no actual corroborating evidence, there should be some sort of penalty. This is how we've gotten these terrible news networks, on both sides, by allowing people to not have to do actual research and reporting on stories that may or may not have even happened. 

4. Saying expansion of libel laws is equivalent to abolishing the first amendment is fundamentally wrong, as the right to free speech isn't the only right enumerated in the first amendment. 

5. If libel laws are expanded, it isn't an abolition because trump wouldn't be suing from the government, legally speaking, he'd be suing as a citizen. Now, if he changes it to say he's using the government to sue, I'll be right with you, but he's not, and as of now he can't. ",nan

It basically goes like this: ""hey, she puts out easily, so it should be a piece of cake to get laid with her"".

Holy fuck, this makes too much sense. Far too much.

It reminds me of a night out recently with two of my friends. There was no woman with us, but the basic clueless beta thinking behind what you describe was the same.

So I was out having drinks with my non-clueless beta incel friend A and the most clueless Gutmensch incel guy I know, I think I need to give him a name ...Ben.

A was talking about his job and I asked him: ""By the way, does Chad still work there? And does he still hit on all the female coworkers?"" One of my ex-girlfriends had worked at the company for some time over 10 years ago and she always talked about how Chad was hitting on every single one of his coworkers. I actually met him. Good looking, masculine, but unintelligent and unlikable on first sight. Picture a professional fake-tan Ballermann Schlagersinger. 

A said: ""Yes, he is still working there and coincidentally, we have a new really pretty 22yo college-educated intern. I like her, she is intelligent and nice...and now she is together with Chad.""

Me: ""Wtf? He must be 40+ right now? Chad and a college student? Really?

A: ""Yes, I can't understand it.""  

We described Chad to Ben and his eyes lit up: ""Isn't that GREAT?! If such a dork can get a pretty intelligent nice young girlfriend, it means that it must be ridiculously easy for nice guys like us!!""

A and I tablepalmed and I said: ""No, Ben. No. This is the *opposite* of what it actually means.""

Ben: ""But...but...but""

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?  
1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

Ja, davon hab ich auch schon gelesen, dass bei der SWR die ersten 10 Jahre den größten Schaden am Portfolio anrichten können. Auch die SWR ist halt nicht in allen Marktmodellen ein totsicheres Modell, zumindest jedenfalls dann nicht, wenn man partout 4% pro Jahr abgreifen will. Und nach dem jahrelangen Aufschwung, den wir bereits hinter uns haben, dürfte eine Rezession in den nächsten 10 Jahren ziemlich wahrscheinlich sein. Aber wer weiß das schon genau.

Ruhestand gehe. Bis dahin sind's noch 17 Jahre (außer das Eintrittsalter ändert sich bis dahin noch fünfmal), das würde den Thesaurierern genug Zeit geben, sich weiter zu entwickeln... 17 Jahre Vorlauf wären genug Zeit, um Aktien-ETFs den Vorzug zu geben vor - zumindest zur Zeit - miserablen Zinsen auf Sparprodukte.

One teacher got sucker punched and by the time he got up there were 3 more teachers running down the hallway going to stop the fight. Then out of no where one of the kids pulls a knife from his backpack. Luckily before he got to do anything he got tackled.

For one, you will get better specs for your money. $699 at the Microsoft store will get you the top of the line SP3 but not even the sp4 with m3 and 128G of storage (it is $749). 

Moreover, I think the SP3 is a better machine. I don't disagree that the SP4 improved the thermals, but nearly every SP4 review says that it has about an hour or hour and a half LESS battery life than the SP3. This is for two reasons: the screen is larger and higher resolution, and they actually shrank the battery (!) to make it thinner.

Moreover, the ""better keyboard"" is fully compatible with the SP3. I am typing this on an SP3 right now using the ""SP4"" keyboard with fingerprint reader (which I much prefer to the unreliable face-detection camera on the SP4). 

Maybe if you are an artiste who needs the very best resolution possible then you should go for the SP4 but otherwise SP3 is in my opinion a better choice. I have both SP3 and SP4 but never use the latter. It was also incredibly buggy at launch (mostly addressed). I have also owned SP1, SP2, S2, S3, and SB.

Lastly, if you can buy SP3 refurbished from MS Store do that. I got mine on Amazon because I did not know that MS was selling them, but that would absolutely be a better option. In fact, knowing that now I may return this unit and get one from the MS store, if only so they will process the warranty and possibly sell me MS Complete.

So I barely played at all this month, wasted lots of stamina because I started a different game, regularly checked in, did random shit but not really giving PAD much attention. Saved 35 stones and figured WTH, I really don't care anymore. 

**Arcline**, a decent start but surprisingly the only time the light gala interfered, after taking massive dumps on me most of last year. 

**Alrescha**, oh you're new, an actual featured unit, first time I got that in about 6 months. 

**Sharon**, oh the water wizard, got the red one too, just need your green friend to complete the set. 

**Freyr**, well aren't you a surprise, already got your sister so now you 2 can have a reunion. 

**Rodin**, finally, could have used you a long time ago buddy but welcome nonetheless. 

**Satsuki #4**, there's my shit luck, still on the fence about selling the 3rd, certainly don't need a 4th, sold. 

I think i'm done here. Wait...the GF description says increased rates for Kali's? Screw it, last 5 stones, not like i'll actually get DKali though, not with my luck. 
Final roll was indeed, **DKali**. O__o

It's like this game knows I stopped paying much attention to it and is trying to win me back by giving me stuff. :P",nan

After riding Elixir 5s for a while, and trying friends' bikes with Shimanos (new and last gen XT mostly), I would say avoid Shimano if you like the Elixir feel. The XTs are very strong, but modulation is more difficult, they're very on/off compared to Avids.

Perhaps try the mid range SRAM Guides,  or treat yourself (it's brakes, they're quite important) and go with Hope. The new Tech 3 lever has great modulation, very Avid like, and the new E4 caliper is quite powerful.

Reaching a point of emaciation puts an added stress on everything. Had Larry began with an extra 10lbs of fat hanging on him, I think have gone another week. I'd be curious to know which of them actually lost the most body weight.

None of the tap outs on season 2 were officially because of starvation. Dave probably would have won regardless, as I think he would have stayed 'till they medically evacuated him. Also looked as if his weight balanced out towards the end (though that would have probably changed come winter). 

Jose in particular always left me wondering. I feel like he may have felt more optimistic about beating hypothermia if he had, say, 10lbs of extra fat on him. That guy went in relatively light and left on the cusp of emaciation.

I feel the same about Callie in season 3. She decided to leave on her own terms, tapping out before getting to a place of desperation. I wonder if she would have felt like going longer if she began fat rather than relatively thin.

Again, though, that's all speculation. Dave and Fowler won the contests they were competing in, not the hypothetical contests they weren't. ",nan

- FF5, the characters and story were bland and forgettable, especially the villain Exdeath.

- FF8, the story jumps the shark later on and does a horrible job rationalizing it.

Good Writing:

- Grandia, like a lot of people who've played this say, the game has lovable characters while evoking the feeling of an epic adventure.

- Dragon Quest 8, some might say this is tropey, but I actually really enjoyed the character's personalities and the way they reacted off of each other, and I also enjoyed the way the story managed to balance lighthearted humor with dark and dramatic moments.

- Chrono Trigger, this is the game I feel did the best job fleshing out all the characters. Having the option to explore their backstories further as opposed to rushing it into the main game was genius.

You've even gotten the answer more than once; but seem to be reading more into it. But really, it boils down to people protecting what they want to see in the community. 

It very much is sad people feel the need to brigade TrollX, much less any sub, but it happens - and requires upkeep to deal with. Members here are inundated with bullshit elsewhere, it gets used as a retreat. So they made their own space to escape some of it. Every community has its own jargon, and a sense of what is and isn't acceptable. They have things they want to see and things they don't. Most guys that come here seem to get our deal. It doesn't make this community or its members broken to enforce that, it makes them people tired of bullshit. 

So yeah, maybe you should chill about the dude getting a few downvotes. Being that most of us don't obsess over post history, he's going to have lots of chances to earn more Internet points back based on each post he makes. And! he gets to be secure in the fact that even if people disagree with him here, trollx isn't the kind of place where its members doxx, harass or stalk you for it. ",nan

Pokemon GO is what made Twitch IRL, not social eating. The social eating was created to attract the Asian audiences (IRL has killed it) after they saw what cooking did in creative. The eating was suppose to be a strict activity; they literally wanted food (and not snacks) in front of you. If you remember, people like Ice would rush to go back to other sections when food was almost done in both those sections because they didn't know the full rules. Pokemon GO is what opened up activities.
 
The Ice_Poseidon pokemon go stuff that went viral is what convinced them to bring over IRL no doubt, as he had to keep getting clarifications on how long he would have to have gameplay up and that would interfere with the soon-to-come IRL action.

It's not like sexuality ceases when you're in a committed relationship, and normal people can acknowledge the sexuality of others without it crossing a boundary within a relationship.  

My fiancee and I will flirt with others, especially our friends but with others as well, because *it's fun and makes everyone feel good*.  But yeah, you do have to be careful to draw the line and make sure the involved parties know there's a line.  

Dancing is a good example of this.  We go social dancing.  Dancing is flirtatious and fun - and it's fun to dance with lots of different partners.  It's fun to make your dance partner feel sexy - man or woman.  It's also fun to know that other people desire you, or will at least make you *feel* desired.

How about distinguishing between a day where you deadlift and a day where you isolate minor muscle groups. Shouldn't you compensate accordingly for the greater amount of calories needed to repair your legs and back after squatting opposed to shoulders? If you eat the same on your light days wouldn't you gain more fat? Are we not trying to gain the least fat during a ""lean bulk""?

Edit: The problem lies within how many days are you going to waste before figuring out you need more food to grow? Let's say your deadlift weight is down, was it a lack of sleep? Just a bad day? We can't just up our calories from one bad lifting day, we need more evidence. Deadlift day two rolls around, another bad day, ok now we know we need to up the calories. We add a hundred cals for our 3rd deadlift day this month, mind you we have wasted weeks now figuring out if we needed to up the calories. Personally, I dont  want to risk wasting 3/4 of a months lifts figuring out if my calories are high enough to grow.

And to be clear, AMD also want to avoid a price war. 

edit: to be clear Intel has ZERO financial incentive to lower prices to keep a few % of market share. lowering prices to do so it financial suicide.  But if AMD capture well over 20%, it then become a viable option. And we are far from that.",nan

I would recommend spending more time in Hartford than West Hartford. West Hartford is a suburb and its biggest hangouts are a suburban mall with a Cheesecake Factory. Blueback Square is certainly not a dump. But at the end of the day, it's just a mall. My guess is that it's going to get old fast for you.

So here is the part where I'll plug Hartford. Things to do in Hartford: Bears BBQ, Blind Pig Pizza (same owner as Bears), see music at Arch Street Tavern. Drink beer at City Steam Brewery, Hog River Brewery in Parkville, Hanging Hills Brewery (they have community events too). Go to a Hartford Yard Goats (AA Baseball) game. See a play at one of downtown's theaters (student rush tickets are $15). Go to a creative cocktail hour. Learn printmaking at a class at Hartford Prints. Go to a Know Good Market event. Go to the Wadsworth Museum. See shows or take classes at Sea Tea Improv. Ride your bike in Hartford. Get familiar with Bicico in the Parkville neighborhood in Hartford. They're a bicycle co-op and they sell bikes. You might even be able to learn how to fix up your bike there.

My main point is this. Don't let co-workers or 'Hartford haters' on r/connecticut scare you in to thinking that the only things that are happening in the region are only in WeHa. Hartford is getting more stuff all the time.

It doesn't have to be all or nothing, and you can let it show you what it can do by taking a more conservative approach and pruning further out in places that you'll eventually remove anyway. That way, you get to see how it responds to certain techniques before accidentally butchering it.

I've not worked with this particular species, so I can't speak for how well it will respond. I think maybe /u/adamaskwhy has worked with it - maybe he'd have more relevant advice.

Abs are very possible. It depends on your bodyfat. If you don't have well defined abs at that weight and height, then you may be skinny fat (I have no idea if you are, no pics) But I wouldn't recommend trying to cut for a six pack if you want to get bigger.

Protein shakes are not the only way to getting bigger. It depends on what you eat, some good, healthy weight gainer foods I like are peanut butter and yogurt.",nan

&gt;hard hitting once in awhile

[Here's a venn diagram](http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/14076.png) of how I see the two systems; A is scars and wounds, B is Laying Waste.

When Laying Waste hands out minor debuffs, scars and wounds doesn't do anything; when scars and wounds becomes active, Laying Waste is dropping ""permanently blind"", and ""target's heart ruptured"" (I just hit the generator twice). The biggest difference, IMO, is that Laying Waste is simply a more cohesive system; plus, severity is more consistent, you're not randomly getting a minor scar or losing an arm, you're losing an arm or something relatively comparable. Perhaps a broken jaw seems less severe, but taking away a caster's ability to use verbal components?

I used scars and wounds prior to Laying Waste, and I've found the later more or less just expands and improves upon the former.

But, it's your game, do what you wanna do; I can't tell you, who to sock it to. :P",nan

Retaliating those hits instead gives a net attack potency of 10, while a Soul Break can do much more than that. And except for special cases like Gilgamesh's BSB or USB, Retaliate strategies take both ability slots.

When taunts aren't viable because it's a PHY AoE, Cecil's Cover LM still does great work. If it's because it's NAT, at least a taunt gives a stackable DEF buff that would help with Guardbringer.

Magic Lure is the other option if not bringing Celes or Exdeath for Runic.

Also, once you get Sorc's pet (totem thing) to 5*, he offers a lot of cc protection that i think may override a Fairy.  From what i read, upon Sorc spawning, all units are cleansed of any cc and also are immune from them for a short time.  Plus his totems last 50% longer.  So a lot of potential there over a Fairy.

Foundry Lane and the roads off of it aren't bad at all with nice appearances, and are very quiet and seem to be safe. You're right in that Upper Shirley (which is North) is pretty fancy, but you also have the council housing and Shirley Towers North of the High Street which does sometimes look a bit run down.

Regent's Park is not Northlands Road area - it is close to Shirley and Millbrook, sort of inbetween them. In terms of how nice the area it is, it depends which bit really. Regent's Park Road is pleasant, as are the roads that come off it.

To u/Solarbeef, I just want to add to the comments above! 

Polygon: Noisy as fuck when the students are in. If you want quiet streets in the evenings then that isn't going to happen at term time! Lots of big houses to rent.

Inner Avenue: If you're further South, the area's a little more studenty and less tidy looking, but north has roads like Winn Road and Westwood Road which have loads of flats and apartments. You're close to the common there, and town isn't a long walk away.

Shirley: I'm biased as I bought a place here after living on Hill Lane for 6 years! The high street is an interesting little place. Lots of odd people, but Mostly Harmless. Lots of charity shops, but also butchers, green grocers, pasty shops, plenty of takeaway places, a few decent restaurants, a good number of pubs, a McDonalds (ha), some supermarkets (Iceland, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Polish and European places) and a gym. And a mail depot!

Portswood: Very similar to Shirley in terms of amenities, but the residents are more studenty whereas Shirley is quite a mix of all age groups (and income levels too). Fewer odd people roaming the main street!!

Hill Lane and Upper Shirley: Very fancy! Close to the Common, and nice and quiet. Lots of big, expensive houses. A little further from a main high street, and a little bit of a longer walk to town. Quiet but close enough to main roads to get on them quickly if driving to work.

Freemantle: A lot like Shirley, really, in terms of the types of houses and people, but from wandering around it seems there are probably more rented houses and the appearance sometimes reflects that. A little further from high streets and main shops, but a pretty short walk to the train station. Quite cheap rent wise too, and lots of purpose built flats in some of the roads.

It depends where you're from, but I think most people would feel safe in most of Southampton. If I was to tell my friends from the village I lived in areas to avoid, I'd go with Thornhill, St Mary's, Rownhams, Millbrook and Maybush. Plenty of lovely people live there but the areas just aren't as nice as the rest of Southampton.",nan

People here also have an attitude of ""Just get on with it."" But there is also the idea that the IRA's terror campaign was never about racking up an ""infidel"" body count like you see in other conflicts. They had contacts at various news rooms and a list of code words so that when they planted a bomb they would give a warning and the army would have enough time to evacuate the area and prevent mass casualties. So in that sense civilians were *usually* not directly targeted so people just went about their business somewhat safe in the knowledge that if there was a bomb it probably wasn't meant for them.

That being said there were some bad periods where there were attacks which had the sole purpose of targeting civilians and killing them from whatever side, a grenade thrown into a the crowd at a funeral for example, or indiscriminately shooting into a bar frequented by one side or the other. But for the most part the major IRA bombings were not aimed at killing normal people but more to destroy a building, make a statement, or assassinate a particular person or group of people (usually the army/police). They felt that killing too many people with the bombings would cause them to lose support and ultimately that's partly what happened with the Omagh bomb which was the worst single incident of the entire ordeal killing 29 people. The cease fire had already been in place for 2 years at that point but it was tenuous and there was still a lot of support for the IRA and it's various now split factions, but after that point they quickly lost a lot of whatever support was left.

The army, RUC and now the PSNI are and have always been since the start directly targeted so for them and their families it's a different story, but they are trained for it so it doesn't have the same impact that it may have on a civilian. We are one of the only modern countries where *all* our police are trained in anti ambush and anti terrorism tactics. Basically every police officer in Northern Ireland is trained to a *similar* standard as a SWAT team in another country might be, which again is unique in the UK.

Sorry for the rambling this ended up being way longer than it needed, the point I was intending to make is this; neither side ever really trusted or relied on the government here, or the army or the police so when there was an incident they pulled together as a community to cope with it and deal with it, some times that led to retaliation some times not but the point is they relied on their communities for support rather than the government, apposed to dealing with it by sitting at home and hoping that big brother takes care of business for you which seems to be the go-to reaction in America. ""What is the government going to do about it?"" ""How did they let this happen"" etc etc. Where as here there was much more an attitude of ""What can we do about it.""

TL:DR, We have a great sense of humour and a great sense of community even if the communities were completely polarised and at each others throats for a long time.",nan

Mira Williams vs Katrina Avenko: this match, I tell you now, I would *definitely* have to see it 'till the end as both are evenly trained out with fighting techniques, military backgrounds and all around fighting abilities. Bear in mind that Williams is both an Organic and Synthetic being at the end of the trilogy she's in and that Avenko is a powerful superhuman who's power *almost* rivals that of Kyle's powers (1 of my earlier characters) before he fully *Ascended* to his hybrid form. Than again, I may be slightly off. But still, the fight would be a match made in Heaven.

Anakan Krowe and Mira Williams vs Vallek and Rick Williams: This match is as unorthodox as it is untraditional as the last 2 are my oldest characters are the main villains and the first 2 are my new heroes. It's also unorthodox because although Mira and Rick do share a common last name, they share another trait: both are hybrids. One's an Andro-Draconis (part man and dragon being), the other's an organic/synthetic being. As for Krowe and Vallek, it'd be an interesting fight because both are powerful in their own rights. ",nan

You'll be talking to her and she'll randomly say something very harsh. Then she'd cover her mouth and immediately apologize. She tried cutting her own hair and failed miserably, so she wore different wigs. A lot of people called her crazy, Brittney Spears, that kind of stuff. I used to snap at people myself and tell them to not bully her. She seemed like a truly good but troubled soul.  
She wanted to join the track team, but she took medicine that slowed her down. I'm not sure of the specifics. But she needed that medicine to keep herself in check. She stopped taking it though.  
A week before graduation she missed a day of school. There was a nasty rumor that she went off the deep end and killer her sister. I told them all to stop saying such nasty things. I really liked this girl. She was even my lab partner all year.

You have already started to create a narrative here with your language. 

First of all, you implicate that I don't care for the mental and physical well being of the rape victim. 

Of course I do. 

Then, you implicate that the totality of the rape victim's lack of mental and physical well being is a result of having to carry the baby to term.

No, a large portion of it is from the rape itself.

Now, being pregnant and not being allowed to kill said baby will no doubt cause her a lot of **temporary** mental and physical grief, and a smaller amount of close to permanent mental/physical grief. Rape is a terrible thing. 

I do care for her well being, but at the same time I care for the well being of the growing child. 

And I cannot sacrifice the life of the child just to make her wellbeing a bit better. Or even a lot better. 



&gt;and the falsely accused

Now you are bringing up a group that will be of an extremely small number. 

Rape victims is relevant, and this is too, but let's acknowledge that the numbers of falsely accused, especially in a convoluted and difficult system, will not be huge. 

Further **you assume** the system will require a specific accuser, and that **DNA Tests** won't be able to prove who is right. 

Sure, before DNA tests go active, it might cause grief. But that will be proven temporary, and punishments in place for intentional false accusations should push this down. 

But again, **you are ASSUMING** a specific accuser must be named to draw these conclusions.

What if this isn't a requirement? 

Then your argument largely falls apart in this aspect, though I'm sure some small number would still exist.





&gt;(both groups comprised of sentient,)

Sentience is not a necessary requirement for Personhood, not by the definition I believe. 

So this means nothing to me. 

&gt; innocent humans) 

Oh, just like the innocent unborn ones. 

Except these ones aren't being executed. 

&gt;can only be consistently eclipsed by the birth of non-sentient humans.

You mean by *the LIFE* of thousands of times more unborn humans.


Not just the birth, though that is the main aspect of it.

&gt;This really does get to the crux of the matter that neither side seems to want to admit

With quite a bit of bias, yes. 

&gt;: how do we weigh the rights and well-being of innocent people? 

Certain things are clearly greater evils.

Executions of thousands of innocent humans daily is pretty hard to top.

&gt; Whose life is “worth” more?

Now slow your roll here buddy. Don't start trying to equate the mental and physical grief a rape victim suffers from being pregnant with her dying. 

I 100% support medical abortions. If a rape victim will die by being pregnant, I support being able to abort that child. 

So it's not about equating the ""life worth"" of victims. 

&gt;For the extreme pro-lifers, it sounds as though the lives of unborn children outweigh the lives of everyone else.

Radicals of every group usually hold radical opinions that don't reflect the whole.

Jeskai Saheeli is way, way easier to interact with than twin was - Twin can conceivably win without giving the opponent a chance to interact with Sorcery speed cards while also tapped down an opponent's land. Jeskai Saheeli either needs to wait until turn 7 to tap out completely for the combo or risk not having the combo go off. You can't tap out for Saheeli on 3 and then play Felidar on 4 like you could flash in Exarch on 3 and then tap out for Twin on 4.

Jeskai Saheeli is a good deck. I'm skeptical about the 4 mainboard Condemns in the deck, which just seems bad in most matchups, and I don't think it has another wincon besides beats if the opponent manages to Surgical Saheeli or Felidar, but the core of the deck is 100% solid.

But if I can be honest, and I could do it all over again, I would try to get an accounting job right away, entry level or intern, while you study for and sit for the CPA exam. If you can swing it study for the exam and do your MS program at the same time, this way your employer will likely pay for your master's degree, and all your study courses for the CPA, or at least a portion of them.

Doing it this way I think would solve a couple of problems. First of all you would get to try out the field of accounting and see if it's even for you. Furthermore you might decide that you like one area better than the other, audit versus tax. Depending on what the master's program looks like, you could focus your courses in one or the other, or maybe even switched to a masters in taxation. Secondly I think most people on this forum would agree that experience trumps everything in the accounting field, so the sooner you can acquire the experience and knowledge in the field the better off you're going to be long-term in your career. Just my two cents, I could be wrong, but looking back this is how I would have done it",nan

Reasonable assumption. I thought something similar around this time.
&gt; My theory is that Shanks could have a 4th type of haki, as I think him simply having ridiculously strong haki is way too underwhelming. There has to be something special.

On the surface that sounds reasonable. But who's to say you can't just be *that* much better with the regular 3 Haki types?
&gt; While I don't think this, it would be cool if he has eaten a unique and fourth type of devil fruit, as haki haki no mi fits the general four letter code, and yes I know there are exceptions.

I think a Haki Haki fruit would just count as a Paramecia
&gt; Kaido being zoan is obvious as can be, I'm guessing mythical zoan, type; minotaur.

It isn't a spoiler to say, others have guessed he's a dragon or an Oni.

I personally think he's just really really strong. No fruit, otherwise he could've killed himself by drowning.
&gt; And then we have Teach who is well established as a logia user ++. 

I mean, he's a combination of the most un-logia logia user possible and the ""strongest"" paramecia fruit.
&gt; This leaves paramecia for Big mom, which I feel is supported by her saliva droplets seen during Fishman Island. At the very least it's not nothing. She has also mentioned her stomach acid.

Did you know that human saliva and stomach juice is *naturally* acidic? Not to the point of Big Mom's but still, it doesn't have to be anything *particularly* unnatural.
&gt; I definitely think the dancing rainbows, grassy Hils, clouds and coffee cups along with everything else are spawned from her ability.

/smiling

Spawned how exactly? What do you imagine?
&gt; Yet she can't eat that stuff, at least based on logic, begging the question whether all that stuff actuality is alive or not.

What definition for ""Alive"" are you using?
&gt; I think based on what we have atm it's too early to be able to deduce our way to her ability, as I feel like nothing we have seen demonstrates her offensive capabilities.

It is a bit too early to deduce the ability. Yes. I just wanted to hear some guesses.
&gt; If that isn't the case and based on what we have from 786 and before is sufficient to guess, THAT I would want to know.

You haven't missed anything big as far as I can remember, though if you want an extremely low impact hint to keep you guessing, [I've got one here](#s ""Big Mom's powers are based off of an English Idiom"").",nan

September 1999.  My parents' mini-van pulls up to my dorm at Rutgers to move me in for my sophomore year.  One of my friends comes running out - ""We got ethernet!  They wired the building!""  Rutgers had a 5 year plan to wire all the dorms for high-speed internet (pre wi-fi days) and ours wasn't even on the list.  Except . . . it was!

Even better, Napster had just come out around the same time.  Search for a song, download it in seconds!  It was hilarious to watch the download speed rocket up to 1000k/s.  Before that it could take half an hour to download a song.  

I really can't think of a similarly dramatic leap in technology in the past 10-15 years.  Maybe HDTV become standard.  Maybe once VR leaves the early adopter phase in another year or two.  But I don't think anything is going to beat a 200x increase in internet speed.",nan

First he says he can't put the crown back on because my teeth shifted?? I don't know about that. He would have to get a mold for a new one... ok... but shouldn't be just do a bridge since the tooth in front needed a root canal as well? He assured me that 2 crowns was the solution. 

I've always been able to feel dental work a little bit even though they numb me, but I just suffer a bit for the few minutes they are drilling.  

Well this time was no different.  I felt the drilling.  He stopped working and gave me a second shot,  waited like 10 minutes and started working again.  

NOPE. Still feel it. So I get shot #3. Wait.  He starts working again.  I. STILL. FEEL. IT. This time he tells me that he's almost done,  just bear with it. So I do. 

The problem is he was not almost done.  He worked on me for another half hour.  I felt EVERYTHING. Tears and snot was running down my face.  I was sobbing and screaming.  Squeezing the chair arms.  Kicking my feet... 

I was so drained when he finally finished I don't know how I made it home.  My SO had never seen me like that and I gave birth to our 5 children...

I had to ice it and take antibiotics. I was sore for over a week.  So I thought the worst of it was over.  I go back so he can take measurements.  

He takes an xray for the insurance company. Comes back into the room and says that he cracked the tooth down by the root and I would now need posts. (Extra $$$)

Oh and he said I should just do a bridge because the teeth are next to each other.  

Really?! 

Then he claims I needed a third root canal.  

I noped the fuck out of there.  I had the rest of the work done at a different dentist (who was a pleasure and I didn't feel anything) and no I didn't need the 3rd root canal! I'm thinking I didn't need the second either.

Many sculptors start on softer stones like soapstone. Find a stone yard and talk to the supplier about what you're doing and what your budget is. Sculpture is a very satisfying pursuit. Good luck and pm me if you like. ",nan

Max W. Basically, you are looking to keep your ADC topped off with Q (and the occasional shield) and threaten with W. He plays very similarly to Alistar in the early game. Wait for your enemy to use a cooldown, and that's when you are seriously looking to W, auto+Q (or if you can, Q+W into auto) and E out when they are looking to retaliate.

The aim of your game early should be to threaten a trade that ends very poorly for them, and then just act as sustain. Even with Coin, you still have plenty of kill threat if the enemy uses 1 CD incorrectly.

For example: you are Rakan+Tristana playing against Thresh+Vayne. Thresh tosses out his Q and misses (~13s CD) and Vayne uses her Q shortly after to get a CS. That means tumble is on a ~5s CD, and Thresh is without hook - look for a trade onto Vayne (or even Thresh, preferably Vayne) with W+Q+Auto in order to proc Thunderlords. Dash out when you believe Vayne's Q to be back off CD (unless you can kill, of course). Continue to wait for trade opportunities, abusing enemy CDs. In the meantime, you should be fishing with Q's for sustain and poke (because you have coin meaning you have infinite mana sustain).

&gt; I feel as if I haven't had the chance to really get to know the setting in a physical sense, but that's due to the scope of the first book. I imagine subsequent titles will involve more exploration if the ending is any indication.

Definitely. Barely scratching the surface so far. 

&gt; What's more, it isn't all laid out even in the vaguest sense: there's clearly more going on outside of the literal bubble (well, dome) SAM takes place in. 

Heh. Apt.

&gt; His relationship with his ex-retainer, Sera, is one that I hope persists moving forward—whether for better or worse. They seemed to jive well. The same goes for Jin.

Expect more of both of them in the sequel.

&gt; I didn't really connect with Corin, and found his wit usually fell flat, but I'm very hard to please on that front. 

That's because of a defect that occurred in the cloning factory. I'm so sorry.

Which one of us was cloned with the terrible sense of humor? That's a mystery.

&gt; All that considered, I most enjoyed Patrick and Marissa.

Definitely will be giving both of them more screen time in the next book as well.

&gt; I don't like academy settings, schools, or what have you. But I wasn't all that bothered by it in SAM.

Cool.

&gt; More than anything, the Tower and mock-Tower sessions were a blast.

I love those, too.

&gt; I'm disappointed that there was no mention of two Towers touching, maybe the Towers themselves having a sword fight.

I came in a little late, but overall, it wasn't as great as I had hyped myself for it to be. Franz (A German Spy), as /u/Arontala put perfectly, *""lectures rather than explains,""* and that hurts the conversations as a whole for me. Especially-so when he continually gets cut off but continually tries to interject instead of just waiting. I can't remember the sentence he wanted to get in, but I listened to him repeat the first ~3 words at least a dozen times. He just doesn't fit the format, in my opinion. It doesn't help that there's already four other people trying to get their bit in.

***

I read (and have somewhat seen) that Woolie's basically being told where to go, what to do, and how to do it. That's kind of disappointing. I was expecting *""I'ma just run through here--OH SHIT!""* Y'know? A *""true""* Souls game experience.

***

The audio's fucking terrible at times. Apparently there was some issues earlier, but Christ, the volume on their mics seems to be fluctuating so much (would make sense if they were moving away from the mic...but they're not). Franz is a bit loud, but not terrible.

Great lecturer, hes very passionate about what he teaches so you'll notice him go on tangents if people ask questions about something he's interested in, I found funny imo. GET READY TO READ, politics in general is a heavy reading major but holy shit Eaton makes you read about 50-100 pages for each lecture, so make sure you stay on top of your reading because catching up is a bitch. His exams are relatively easy as long as you go to lecture, do your reading and study the study guide. Eaton gives you everything that will be on the exam on the study guide before so take advantage of that because most professors don't even study guides. ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MSI/LSS IT FORCES YOU TO STAY ON TOP OF YOUR READING/GET HELP WITH ESSAYS AND GIVES YOU AN EXTRA 2 PERCENT FOR YOUR GRADE.

A couple times during the months leading up to that first time, I had wet dreams. I didn't know that was a thing, so I got scared because I thought it was pee, and that I had a UTI.

One night, I just decided to try it out, because I was horny and bored. I didn't actually know it was common practice to use some sort of lubricant, so I just did it dry (feels pretty good in a different way, actually). It was definitely the best, most satisfying orgasm I've ever had while masturbating

4059,2017,8,dkzpjfe,nan,WritingPrompts,1503655324,0,0,0,"I immediately took it as option three. The fact that, to you, it was perceived to be the least likely, I think does some to shed some light on this controversy. I don't mean that in the pejorative; I'm not saying, ""The fact that you saw it this way just goes to show..."" something demeaning about you and people that post there, no, that's not what I mean here. I think this genuinely gets at the root of where the conflict comes from, and it's all down to perception of intent. When I myself phrase something like Tyson did in that quote, I'm trying to illustrate in extremely granular detail what it is that is happening, on a phenomenological level. I'm trying to break it's *normalcy*. We accept unreasonable things mostly due to the ""tyranny of the default"", a term in user interface development to indicate how which ever way the programmer pre-configured the application, 99% of users will leave it that way, and this applies to most other areas of our lives as well. Pointing out in such granular detail helps to illustrate how *ridiculous* it is, and hopefully, begins to shatter the illusion we've been lulled into accepting ""because why would it be any other way?""

You read it in a manor that suggests... I'm not sure ""contempt"" is the right word, but close to that sentiment. Definitely suspicion. An incredulous bias that the speaker is being disingenuous with their motives, or engaging in some other kind of obscurantism. I don't want to make assumptions about you, but if I did, I might ask if you'd had experiences in the past of having to be suspicious of people due to their language? I'm not trying to project anything on you, I'm just trying to find a commonality between you and others who interpret things this way. I really do think it all comes down to an issue of perceived intent that doesn't match that of the speaker.

Either way, I'd love to hear anything thoughts you might have about it, if you're not immediately adversarial to the idea of self reflection. I dismiss /r/iamverysmart users for anti-intellectualism but I may be disparaging them unfairly myself, and if that's the case, I think *understanding* eachother better is the first step to coming together.",nan

As a counter point to the parent post, here's why I think you should consider Fundies 1:

* You want a more thoughtful/nuanced look at ""programming"". Many intro classes focus squarely on the mechanics of programming, without focusing on the elegant solutions that from a set of core, high-level primitives. Fundies does that well.
* You are willing to learn a language, even if it's not used in the ""real"" world. A surprising number of people don't see the merits in learning a language that they will never be paid to do, especially if it challenges their traditional way of thinking.

Why you **shouldn't** take fundies:

* You already know a functional or ML based language (Rust does not count)
* You want to learn to program from the perspective of a software engineer, not as a computer scientist.
* You care about your GPA   ",nan

4076,2017,5,dgytb8y,nan,TheSilphRoad,1494515181,0,0,0,"When I ask that gym position be assigned based on prestige contributed it's for three reasons.

1. A gym is a highscore board from 1-10. Currently a noobs level 28 Gyarados can ""beat"" the highscore of my level 40 Slowbro. Gym battles are arcadey action, I like the idea of seeing my stuff in the top spot if I add the most prestige like getting the #1 spot on Galaga88 in an arcade and carefully selecting DAV or whatever your 3 letter nick was.

2. I want to put in what I consider a powerful mon without getting kicked out or hurting the gym. So currently I put in my 2400cp Confusion/Ice Beam Slowbro. Ok, I will almost certainly be on the bottom and the first to be shaved off. Not only that, assuming I've prestiged 5 open slots.. Now what? A bunch of annoyed trainers have to take it from level 6 to level 10 against a super annoying to prestige mon. I'm probably more likely to be shaved off JUST so they can prestige more easily. I've had that happen with one of my bottom Blissey.. Someone couldn't be bothered spending twice as long to get 500xp so they simply shaved it off and prestiged up another 3-4 spots against their karp which they then alt booted too.

3. It stops me being shaved off. Sorry shaver, I put 10k in to bring it up from level 9 to 10, you're going to have to do the same or better to take me off, not knock a single mon and prestige it up 1000.

The current situation is what is called ""The Tragedy Of The Commons"". Essentially, everyone works in their own selfish interests even if they know it's worse in the long run because everyone else is doing the same and anyone acting selflessly is just taken advantage of. My local meta is my local meta, me tearing a gym down and opening spots doesn't change that, it gives me zero real control over what I put in the gym and probably actively harms the gym if I put in the low CP non traditional defenders because my teammates won't know how to deal with them. Now there is nothing wrong with being selfless and opening up spots. I've taken my team through the easiest gym building strats. I've taken them out on karp hunting trips, told them to look for the old bubblers, the new bubblers, I often leave my karp or bubbler at the bottom of a gym (I only have one account) just to help the team out. The alternative is putting a Gary or a Arcanine in as an easy prestiger. That is all good practice for being a selfless team leader. It's got zero to do with the benefits of killing shaving by ordering a gym by prestige and being able to put my annoying defenders at the top of a gym instead of a Gary or Dragonite.",nan

Cushioning is great for anything where there is going to be lots of repeated impact like running but it's not going to give you any benefit with the weights.

4173,2017,8,dkztien,nan,YouEnterADungeon,1503657418,0,0,0,"*My name is Valentine Shockley. I have several degrees in Psychology and other social sciences, but no Ph.D. (yet) so I'm not a Dr. However, for several years I was a coroner's assistant and for several others, a therapist, until the War. Through my life experiences, I have become somewhat of a Linguist, speaking English, German, Spanish, Japanese and Greek.*

*Ever since I was about 13 years old, I could hear strange whispers around me. I would catch bits and pieces of conversations that others around me couldn't or wouldn't hear, and when I would ask about them, I wouldn't receive any answers. It soon came to my knowledge that I could hear the thoughts of those around me. Early on, these thoughts were only whispers and a distraction, but soon they became loud. Shouts. Psychic Screams.* 

*When I was 18, I tried to kill myself from the relentless noise of the thoughts of those around me. I slit my throat from ear to ear, and it is a miracle that I'm not dead today. I'm not sure if it was this act or just time that has given me control over the thoughts that used to intrude so violently upon me, but I have been able to direct and control which thoughts I receive. Coupled with my seeming Telepathy, I have gained an almost instant understanding of the emotions of those around me as well, a supernatural Empathy.*  

*When I was 23 years old and working with a Coroner's Lab, I discovered that I could also collect, I'm not sure how to phrase this, but a psychic imprint of sorts, from corpses if I made skin to skin contact with them. This not only told me exactly how the person in question perished, but gave me a general idea of what they were like in their life; what their existence was mainly defined by. To a lesser extent, I have a similar ability with books and literature, provided I understand the language. And by similar, I mean severely limited. If I hold a book for long enough, I am able to learn the contents seemingly by osmosis.*

*These abilities lend a slight advantage in combat, allowing me to know my opponents decisions the instant they make them, and allowing me to react at almost the same time they act. However, I have needed ballistics and other combat training, as knowing how a corpse felt right before they died isn't exactly helpful when somebody is pointing a gun at my head.*

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

XCOM was like the United Nations.  So it made sense for XCOM soldiers to wear their country  flags on uniforms to represent their individual countries.

In XCOM 2, your soldiers are resistance fighters.  XCOM is a rogue organization.  It is no longer sanctioned by any government.  XCOM soldiers are wanted outlaws and fugitives.  So it does not make sense for the soldiers to still wear their country flags on their outfits.  It is fine to show a soldier's national origin in his/her profile.  However, putting a country flag on a fighter's outfit seems silly.  It is a legacy implementation that was unnecessarily carried over from the previous game and does not make any sense in the world of XCOM 2.",nan

Whatever is going on with him has nothing to do with you. He hasn't just dropped all his feelings over night I promise.

And if he does come back you have to talk about whatever this was, and that it can't happen again.

The thing with relationships is, you're growing as people all the time, and sometimes that growing can change things for the couple. You might align sometimes, but life can change things right? You are going to want to be with someone who can grow with you and when things seem to change they don't just abandon ship, they talk to you, that's a great caring partner to be with. A caring partner would recognize that they have been with this person they love for x amount of time (and other conditions that make being with that person great) and talk to them about what's going on.

There is the myopic preconceived notion that most people are programmed with that says that government must solve problems.  This is too a false choice!  The best way to allow more fairness in politics is to make the political class (e.g. government) less powerful and less intrusive into our freedoms.  Take marriage for example... imagine if governments got out of the marriage business and therefore only churches (or whatever entity) defines their respective definition of marriage.  ",nan

By making the marginal cost of attendance at public schools zero for higher income students, you make it more likely they'll attend public schools as opposed to expensive private schools.  Low income students, who can't afford to attend expensive private schools, will find themselves locked out.  And many of the private schools will fail since their subsidies will be going away to pay for public schools, and their paying student base will be shrinking to attend public schools.

If only half of kids can go to college, **there must be some mechanism by which many kids are told ""you can't go to college.""** That mechanism right now is a combination of money and grades.  What you're proposing is to (in effect) make it just grades, but I think that changes the composition much less than you're thinking it will, while at the same time having adverse consequences elsewhere.

France has a system without tuition or debt, but [that system is highly limiting and reserves admission to quality colleges to a tiny fraction of the population who can pass grueling tests and winnowing.](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/dispatches_from_the_welfare_state/2014/02/higher_education_in_france_lots_of_testing_lots_of_planning_not_lots_of.html)  Free French schools largely end up perpetuating the elite of French society who can guide their kids through the maze of hoops and tests and courses.",nan

edit: Actually, the real original combo used Anger over dragon breath (hence why the deck that got hermit druid banned was called ""Angry Hermit""), but dragon breath later replaced it, because you didn't have to play a basic mountain.

Here's the deal, like many others have said looks you may live in a not so safe part of LA. From your post I'd gather you live somewhere just east of the 101 in east Hollywood/Thai Town. The area is walkable but not exactly safe. For steady decent paying work have you looked into green tech jobs? The tech industry has grown exponentially in LA with downtown and playa both leading the way. Likewise in many of those fields and tech areas you'll meet people closer to your age. Rent wise living near there isn't cheap but you'll find if you live in areas near the expo line getting to downtown is easy. As for playa try looking in Palms which is probably the last bastion of affordability on the westside. Try hiking, or checking out some nature groups. Join a sports league, take a cooking class. If your friends can't meet up sometime, learn to enjoy being alone. Catch a movie at QTs theater, in this city anything you do, you can and will find like minded individuals.

Like many others, I was in your situation when I first arrived. It took 6 years before I felt comfortable in income to fully enjoy everything. This is the first place in my 31 years that felt like ""home.""  But compared to many places I've been, and I've traveled the world, few places offer what this city has. There's the descent into LAX at night that even after 14 years still takes my breath away. Beach weather 85% of the year, food and people from all over the world, world class entertainment and nature all within a 2 hour drive.

My advice, it's okay to get discouraged, we all have our bad days. But perseverance is key. If this really is your dream city, explore the possibilities and once your year or so is up, reassess your situation. That way when your settled and have a family, good social network you can look back while living in your home on the beach in Santa Monica or Venice or marina and say ""I made it,"" or you can take solace in knowing you took the plunge and moved to your dream city and ultimately it didn't work out and that's okay. Not everything has a fairy tale ending. But you won't regret anything.

But truly try on your weekends to see LA (not the touristy stuff) but the many hidden treasures and the hole in the wall food spots. There's so much to do and enjoy and taste here that's it's difficult to hate the place imo.

In the game, we're still pretty low level. Hit level 3 end of last session. As a pathfinder conversion Eberron Artificer, this level gives me some pretty versatile casting ability (any 1st level arcane/divine spell for the cost of a full round and standard action, 7 times per day). The shaman in the group got a reserve feat for throwing fire around endlessly. Barbarian is pretty much the same, but more. Not sure what the cleric is getting this level, but he's our resident munchkin so it's probably good.

Basic plot of the campaign is undead hordes claiming the northern country. Party was recruited to help defend a town, which was overrun. Our valiant attempt got us an in with a heroic Brotherhood dedicated to defeating evil. They've sent us out on a recon mission, which ended with a hopeless last stand in an abandoned church against too many undead. We were saved at the last minute by some powerful magic or something, not super clear. Anyway, it brought us within a few days travel of the brotherhood's HQ, so current goal is to get there and report back.

First off, it was a neutral country. If you are the opposition, they are literally *giving*you propaganda that paints you as a monster, a nation that derives it's imperial power off of the soul of weaker nations. You are the nations that disregards self-determination, nation's wishes and are now engaged in an all out, complete mobilization war economy against other powers.  


In addition, the British were unsure whether they wanted to enter the war.  There is a great deal of debate on this topic whether they were or weren't.  There were rumors that they were going to tell the Germans that they wouldn't enter the war!  But everything goes out the window once Germany invades Belgium.  If I recall correctly, the British empire would intervene in a defensive war should Belgium be invaded by external forces.  


Lastly, the entire purpose of going through Belgium was that it was supposed to be quick.  They did not expect resistance, they expected the Belgians to cower and throw their weapons down.  As we know now, they resisted enough to stall the German forces. In addition, they also were able to demonstrate what the war would come to face. The defensive technology had outpaced the offensive technology so much so that even smaller nations like Belgium could cause sizable casualties, relative to size. 


Naturally, the Germans would still penetrate their defenses quickly and gain enough ground to invade France, but in the invasion, machine gun nests, artillery, kill holes, barbed wire, all these things would result in a meat grinder scenario.


Could the entire war have changed if they didn't invade Belgium? Possibly.  But we know what happened when did go through Belgium, and this would shape the history of the twentieth century.",nan

&gt;When a trademark examiner approves a trademark, like they did here, they put it forward for publication. On the date of publication, the public has 30 days to file an opposition. Had the Fine Bros kept quiet for another month, they almost certainly would have gotten this trademark, as no one seemed to notice it. Instead, they announced their ridiculous licensing program and turned all eyes on them. How they were not advised to remain silent a bit longer? No idea. But I can tell you that it was a huge mistake, and one that they will regret. Not only are they experiencing a terrible PR disaster right now, I am also assisting a large group of streamers and content creators in an opposition, pro bono (that means free), because I’m extra pissed about this one.

&gt;It’s as bad as it looks.

&gt;I’ve seen a lot of people arguing that this is just them protecting their brand, and that they would never go around bullying people. We’ve seen that’s blatantly false as they have issued a plethora of C&amp;D’s (if the reddit users claiming to have received ones are to be believed, which I think they are), and have even sent their fans to brigade programs like “Ellen” for doing a similar reaction bit. I watched Kids Say the Darndest Things. These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police.

&gt;This is a TRADEMARK not a COPYRIGHT.

&gt;Those words are not interchangeable, so stop it! Trademarks are much more broad and powerful protection than copyright. They protect your brand and/or logos and slogans. They also protect against things “confusingly similar,” so it’s possible you could be sued for naming your video “Kids have emotions.”

&gt;They already own two trademarks.

&gt;ELDERS REACT AND TEENS REACT are two trademarks they currently have registered. I will also be assisting my clients in cancelling both of those trademarks. It’s a bit more difficult than a straight opposition, but far from impossible. I believe we will win easily.

&gt;They have applied for a lot more than just REACT

&gt;On top of REACT, they have also applied for, and have been approved for CELEBRITIES REACT, ADULTS REACT, PARENTS REACT. We will be opposing those as well. They also are applying for DO THEY KNOW IT?, KIDS VS. FOOD, LYRIC BREAKDOWN, PEOPLE V. TECHNOLOGY, and TRY NOT TO SMILE OR LAUGH. While those are all ridiculously generic and descriptive, in my opinion (they hate coming up with original ideas, huh?), we will not be opposing those just yet. 

&gt;That wraps up where we stand now.  I know it gets complicated fast, and I’m always happy to answer questions if you have them. Feel free to email me at ryan@ryanmorrisonlaw.com or ping me on Twitter at @MrRyanMorrison. Also, spread the word, as the more people we have to oppose the better.

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Each state has a number of electors equal to their congressional representation. Almost all states will direct their electors to all vote for whoever wins the popular election in the state.

This could be the case if the treasure were found after FF has died and the estate had already been settled, unless he left a provision in his will (which is quite possible).  If FF is alive, however, and if he hasn't already given away the rest of his money, he's probably below the limit and he wouldn't have to pay anything at the time.  He would however have to indicate this in his income taxes and give his cost basis (how much he paid to acquire the items in the treasure).  His estate would eventually end up paying the tax if it was worth offer $5.3M.

The poem clearly says that the treasure is a gift: ""I give you title to the gold"".  If would be hard for FF or his estate to later argue that it was not a gift.  I don't see anywhere FF said you'd have to pay taxes on it.

Even if for some reason the finder does have to pay taxes (only scenario is if FF is dead and hasn't provisioned for this in his will and his estate has given more than $5.3M over his lifetime), it would still be prudent for the finder to auction the chest as a whole and pay the taxes.  It is a 35% tax rate, and surely the hit you would take for selling the treasure in pieces rather than as a whole and also under the table would be a lot more than 35%.

4650,2017,5,dgyzfzf,nan,NFL_Draft,1494518150,0,0,0,"I hear the weapons argument a lot, and I see where it comes from - it is pretty clear that there are more NFL guys at USC than there are at Wyoming.

That being said, while I think surrounding talent should be a consideration, it can't (to me) tell much more than a small portion of the story. I say this mainly because I think the argument goes both ways: yes, Allen has fewer NFL weapons to help him move the ball, but he also has fewer NFL defenders trying to stop him. To what extent can we say that the lack of NFL-caliber players he works against week in and week out balances the lack of NFL guys he has on his side? I rarely see this analyzed whenever the weapons argument is brought out to justify a prospect, but I think it's very important. 

Also with regard to the weapons argument and keeping the above in mind, can we really say that the difference in quality of weapons explains the statistical gap? Because the statistical gap here is pretty massive, and while Wyoming isn't USC I would think that there's at least something close to enough talent there on that offense (2 2017 draft picks and 2 more priority UDFA's - that's not nothing) to help a QB put up a performance closer to what we'd see from a weapon-laden USC QB in Darnold than what we actually saw from Allen, *especially* when we take into account the inferior competition said offense would be facing (USC, as noted earlier, has a much tougher schedule).

I just don't see the weapons being a valid excuse for the shortcomings we saw from Allen. I think it's less about his team and more about the flaws you mentioned: poor footwork, poor decisionmaking, not terribly strong eye discipline and inconsistent accuracy/touch. 
To be completely honest with you, I really don't think he's a much more developed passer than a guy like Lamar Jackson - that he isn't getting any of the position-switch talk Jackson is going to have to face is a little surprising.

All that being said, I mostly agree with you: I see what there is to like about Allen. He does have tools. He'll run at least a 4.7, he's huge, he's got a great arm, and he just looks the part of a prototypical QB. I just don't see QB1, that's all.

If you came to me and said Rosen was the clear QB1, I could see the sense in that. I am not personally excited about him as a prospect (I really like athleticism in my QBs, and Rosen is a classic, relatively slow pocket-passer - my least favorite kind of passer, though I'll give him some credit for his footwork), but from what I've seen he makes at least some sense as a QB1, more than Allen does at this point in time. 

Rosen, as you say, seems closer to NFL-development than most prospect, so in my view Rosen = QB1 makes some sense. Allen? Not so much. He just seems way too far away.

But that's just me.",nan

I have met a girl who for all intents and purposes *seemed* interested, at least according to my friends. But some people are really touchy/feel-y and give off the wrong impressions, so I'm never sure what to do. I figured the fact that she was touching my leg and baked me brownies as evidence she liked me, but I was incorrect.

You can never really be sure.

I guess the real solution to this is in numbers. If someone likes you enough, you can probably make a few mistakes or have a few flaws that they'll overlook, but you need to meet a lot of people to find someone who actually likes you for you, and not just in a friend way.  ",nan

So what seems to have happened is that they did the protocol level first, and got that out the door as soon as it was ready, and said, ""things like check-sums for addresses can be handled by the tooling, so we'll worry about that stuff later"". 

Architecturally this sort-of makes sense, but the problem was that people wanted to send each other mETH right away, so using the addresses as they were immediately turned into a de-facto standard. There's a slightly hacky checksum method involving making things upper and lower case, but not everybody is using it, and if your tooling can't insist on it then it's a lot less useful than it could be.

This is then aggravated by the fact that the de-facto standard tooling has ended up being JavaScript, which is notorious for merrily converting things of one type to some other type in some weird way without wanting to bother your pretty little head about it. The python libraries are quite a lot less awful in this respect, but they're currently quite move-fast-and-break-things-ish which isn't really what you want in this context.",nan

&gt; Climate change may have contributed to the suicides of nearly 60,000 Indian farmers and farm workers over the past three decades, according to new research that examines the toll rising temperatures are already taking on vulnerable societies.

&gt; Illustrating the extreme sensitivity of the Indian agricultural industry to spikes in temperature, the study from the University of California, Berkeley, found an increase of just 1C on an average day during the growing season was associated with 67 more suicides.

&gt; Last year the Indian government launched a &amp;pound;1bn insurance scheme to protect against crop failures and try to halve farmer and farm worker suicides.

I can't square the difference between the two, but I'm fairly certain the latter is an important part of our make-up too, *in the right place*. Any thoughts on that contrast? 

For an example, the murder of Charles Lennox Richardson whose last words as quoted were apparently, ""I know how to deal with these Japanese"" right before trying to ride through the heavily armed procession of the vice-regent of Satsuma. Richardson's fate was much mourned in the Victorian newspapers, but most people today have to fight down an urge to laugh at this case of a colonial mentality getting the guy an immediate smackdown. (At this point, I must confess I made [this meme image of the incident](http://68.media.tumblr.com/ce1b67521a58c079356f74c049c2da27/tumblr_nk4z1cXprY1tbbhh6o1_500.jpg).)

And yet, Richardson was, despite his arrogant attitude and ignorance about Japan, unjustly murdered. The Japanese government had signed a treaty promising that English citizens would be safe. Earlier that day, other daimyo processions had let him and his companions ride through because they actually respected the shogunate's law. Richardson had the ill fortune to run into the Satsuma procession, people who thought themselves somewhat independant of the shogunate, despite officially being in fealty to the shogun. Look at it from this angle, and Richardson has more similarities to modern American citizens who run into unjust trouble abroad. People rightly get angry when such people are mocked for their naivete and superior attitudes, because that doesn't justify their being murdered. 

And yet, even after going deep into Richardson's death, pondering the effect on his companions and family, there still is something darkly humourous about it. Colonialism usually doesn't get its come-uppance so *perfectly* and dramatically. It's an upset of the usual order of things. Richardson's privileged position and fame in death can be contrasted to the many quiet deaths in the same period. For example, no one seriously bothered calculating or estimating peasant deaths from upheaval in the Bakumatsu period and Meiji Restoration, although they did estimate samurai deaths. Perhaps, the limit for dark humour is that its targets aren't the voiceless and the oppressed?",nan

lets say what a worker produces in a day = X X 
lets also say that they work in a field that produces everything that is needed to support the worker and that this is represented by one X. the company pays the worker X (the amount they need to survive each day) and gets a surplus of one X/worker. 

now say a technological advance makes it so that each worker is twice as efficient, producing four X

X X X X

where before it was just 2

X X

they are still paid one X because they still need the same things to subsist but the surplus is now 3 X for the company. this is how increased productivity results in a greater profit for the industry. if it were a moral system, increased productivity would mean that workers would be able to work less hours or be compensated more for the increased output. but that is not capitalism.

4840,2016,2,czj9shy,nan,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1458210985,0,2,0,"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. ",nan

But they didn't account for the fact that one cannot simply stomp out nearly two millennia of tradition, and nowadays, even though the ""OF"" and ""EF"" each has its own calendar (but remember - they are both just different expressions of the 'one same Roman Rite'!) there are priests who take the time to write two homilies if necessary for both forms of the Mass, or even pray the Office and live the liturgical calendar of 1962, while offering the *Novus Ordo* each day according to its calendar.

I, for example, use the recommended version of Adobe Flash Player Projector to play RotMG. I get no client-side lag whatsoever. I've been receiving the usual amount of server-side lag in the past few months, but I have been getting more lag since the latest build (The Nest update). 

You should really pay attention in-game before you start telling people that every bit of lag they experience is client-side.

You were able to do some of the old heroic strikes, but no longer, now that there's a playlist. You can't get close to the right light level for it, and even if the lvl 36 playlist were already open, a level 34 might have a hard time with it. There aren't any other intermediate strike playlists now, like the old 22, 24, 26 &amp; 28 playlists. It's 20, and that's it.

The daily missions and Crucible matches are out of reach too.

Nothing can be bought from vendors either, due to the level requirement. It might not even be possible to earn the new legendary mark currency either, can't remember. You used to be able to squeak by and still get vendor gear before, without buying any expansions, even if you didn't 'need' the new gear because you didn’t have higher level content to play in the first place. No longer. More than usual was taken out for those who didn’t buy the DLC, but things were still made irrelevant for those who did buy too. Funny how that works.",nan

It was absolutely worth the switch.  I make way more money and am significantly less stressed in this career field.  I also found myself able to relate better to my coworkers in this field as opposed to my fellow officers.  

As for how I did it, it's what I went to school for in college.  Interestingly enough in school I thought I would HATE being a programmer and couldn't wait to graduate so I could pursue my dream of becoming a police officer.  Turns out I hated being a cop and being a programmer wasn't so bad.  My parents were footing a good portion of my tuition and they wouldn't let me major in Criminal Justice (thank god) so I was like ""eh I guess I like computers"" and majored in Information Systems instead.

I would say it's a good career path.  I make good enough money to live quite comfortably in Southern California.  I started my career on the east coast so your mileage may vary.  I'd say it's also worth noting there are different...industries? you can get into programming for.  Personally, I've done my whole career with Department of Defense contractors (Think Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and the like) and I love it.  None of these crazy mandatory 60-70 hour work weeks or anything like that.  In fact going over 80 hours in a two week pay period is a big no-no without prior authorization, which is usually not given.  I've also found that most of these companies follow the 9/80 work schedule.  So we do 9 hour workdays instead of 8 and we get every other friday off (the other friday is the day we usually work 8 hours).  Another argument I'd make for work-life balance in this field is that all of my employers  have been very flexible as far as workday start/end times.  They usually don't when you start/leave as long as you're able to attend all meetings and get your 80 hours per pay period in.  So if you're an early bird or like to sleep in a little they'll usually accommodate you.

The only real con I'd say I've seen is that they tend to drag their feet as much as possible when it comes to promotions/big raises.  Consequently, that usually means if you want the raise/promotion you have to do a bit of employer hopping.  

As far as tips go, get as much demonstrable experience as you can.  Do you have a degree?  And I mean ANY degree.  One of our junior programmers has a biology degree and didn't want to do biology stuff so he did what you did and started taking a bunch of online courses and racked up a bit of experience that way.  In my world many of the contracts given by the government require a degree, but it doesn't specify what kind.  Some of the brightest programmers I've ever met don't have degrees and run into issues getting jobs with defense contractors.  It's stupid I know, but that's how the game is played.  I would also suggest trying to meet people already in the industry.  Networking with people is a great way to find new jobs and get in front of the applicant line when new jobs pop up.",nan

Also, you can't ban too many words because then the chat will be nearly useless. 

In my eyes, grow up. Simply ignoring it will help you. I've been told to ""go back to your country, wetback"" or ""end yourself you fucking leech."" They are looking for attention and trying to get a reaction out of you. My squad and I used to play with a super toxic ""friend"". This guy always told the enemy team to hang themselves and whatnot. And guess that? He was very miserable and unhappy himself. So don't take what they say to heart. There are some genuinely good hearted players out there.  Do what I do.

If you're using a 1/8"" to XLR adapter between the mic and the recorder, this will not work properly, as the recorder will record the difference in the signal between the right and left channels.

Use a 1/8"" extension cable to get the mic plugged into the Ext_input of the recorder, and it should start working. There is no benefit from using a XLR cable here, as the signal coming from the mic is unbalanced.

Edit: the other poster corrected me, the mic is mono. If you use it with a 1/8"" to XLR adapter your recorder will not hear anything, since the signals will cancel out.",nan

My personal answer (and this is just me), is I'm most attracted to women who are 1) intelligent, 2) down-to-earth, and 3) passionate. So, someone who is at least my intellectual equal, isn't arrogant or conceited or inclined to flaunt their credentials as overly important status symbols, and retains their unique, quirky personality and love for being alive and expressing their own unique creative energies.. is pretty much the textbook pattern of who I fall for.

Note that ""physical beauty"" doesn't come up once in the above description. Obviously it matters, as it does to anyone, but practically speaking that just naturally falls out of all the above. In fact, someone who's intelligent, down-to-earth, and passionate would probably look more physically beautiful to me than the exact same person with a less compelling personality. And someone who has physical beauty and nothing else is frankly not at all interesting to me.

""Ambition"", too, does not appear in that list. Frankly, the word ""ambition"" is a turnoff to me. Autonomy, self-reliance, resolve, inner strength - those are all highly attractive words. But ""ambition"" reminds me too much of people who are overly career focused to the point of losing their basic heart and humanity, having little interest outside of their jobs, adopting an alpha-person ""I will take over the world"" attitude, and more often than not just not being very nice or empathetic people. I should offer the caveat here that I live in New York - the land of unhealthily ambitious people, so that probably skews my perception of the term. I've encountered too many people who want to climb to the top and crush anyone who gets in their way, and that kind of ambition is just being a nasty and self-centered human being. I want nothing to do with that, nor to have that as any kind of influence in my life. 

Speaking more directly to your own words, an ""average-looking"" lawyer/doctor/professor could be highly attractive to me depending on her other personality characteristics. But if she chose her career over her partner / family and ended up ""living to work"", I'd be deeply unhappy in such a relationship and would probably not ultimately be able to sustain it.

Please by all means find success and independence so you never have to rely on anyone else for your well-being. But don't forget to laugh, skip, play hooky from work sometimes, and be silly and goofy and loving before you wake up one day and realize you spent the best parts of your life at a desk building up credentials that you can't carry with you to the grave and maybe not having had the raw experiences of love and bonding and basic human companionship that ultimately (in my view) give life its greatest value.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the impression I get from this sub is that men would just hoard women. I think they wouldn't like to share and they would build themselves harems and guard their harems. It's basically what was happening in tribal settings before monogamy. Women wouldn't necessarily flock to the top man, because by staying with a lower man with a smaller harem, they get more man time, so it's balancing the pros and cons.

Would it be the destruction of the family? Maybe men would choose a top woman to be their wife who bears his children. Then he would have many other women just for sex (and he could have all these women work to bring money home for the family while he doesn't have to do anything).",nan

This is a trap even married couples fall into eventually; you gradually develop a routine the both of you follow out of habit and expediency. The cure for that are many, but requires time and effort.. both of which are not easily available in this day and age.

Also, one thing I'd like to add (and those with relevant experience may agree with me), is that for divorcees/widows/widowers, the set sexual habits of a previous marriage may influence your sexual behavior in future relationships. I'm finding this out.. and it's a trap well looking out for.

i would watch stuff like girls being raped by weird demonic monsters, gore stuff, girls with dicks (futanari) who don't like ugly and mannish like trannies, there would be over sized dicks like 30 inch cocks railing tiny girls, shit that is out of this world or defies the laws of physics making it way more crazy. tentacle rape is another good one.

i also got addicted to weird flash games people made involving this crazy shit, and source film maker animated porn. honestly, i even actually got into 3d art, pirated some programs, and made my own animations. i actually uploaded them to some popular sites . i got addicted to coming up with fucked up fantasies and then actually making them in animations or pictures, that is how far this got me.

yes, i do think the animated/cartoon world of porn is far more addicted and fucked up than regular porn. i was never that addicted to regular porn, but once all the limits of real life were removed, it consumed me, i became lost.",nan

So the image would not be sharper, but it would be either taken with a faster shutter speed (better stopped action) or a lower ISO (less noise in the image). It would also have a thinner depth of field.

I would not disagree with you. I see them as quite similar but arguments can be made for either. The 55-210 shot might be a hair better, but it's not like the difference is huge, and brightness and contrast can be adjusted in post very easily. For this test I did not make any adjustments to ensure a fair comparison. There not identical, but the point was they are close, and the benefits of having a single lens that can go wide to narrow, all at a reasonable f-stop are, for a hobbyist shooter like me, significant.

Often I take pictures at various events where if I have to stop and change lenses the moment will be gone. I can say this: I started with the two kit lenses. Then I played with a lot of vintage manual focus stuff. Then my daughter started to run around and I got the 18-105mm and it's more or less the primary lens I have used since. I did get a 70-210mm adapted A-mount lens for wildlife and sports stuff, and I have vintage primes I use for specialist things (like the Rokinon 12mm for landscapes and astrophotography, and a 50mm f/1.4 for use when it gets dark), but the 16-50mm and the 55-210mm have seen no use since I got it other then breaking out the telephoto for this test.

That's cute. You must not be aware of the pact the GOP made before Obama even took office. 

&gt;The Republican plot to obstruct President Obama before he even took office, including secret meetings led by House GOP whip Eric Cantor (in December 2008) and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (in early January 2009) in which they laid out their daring (though cynical and political) no-honeymoon strategy of all-out resistance to a popular President-elect during an economic emergency.

To see if yours is normal, but you, just like others aren't comfortable enough with yours to post it. Wouldn't it make sense to think that there are millions of other women who think theirs isn't worth posting? What you get is a porn-saturated perception of the vagina. Without porn normalizing it, wouldn't we associate a bald vulva with pedophilia? Let's just not underestimate how much porn has determined what we have decided is sexy. The reality is that when someone loves you, or heck, likes you a bunch, they will be overjoyed to see your meat curtains no matter how much they resemble drapery. Really, people do feel better after surgery but only in that one area and you probably want to feel more desirable in more ways than just your vulva. But on the flip side maybe surgery would actually help you distance yourself emotionally from the history of molestation. I'm guessing not enough, but maybe 12% is worth the effort. Also think about if someone is going down there for an extended visit, are you more uncomfortable with how you feel about them having you in such a vulnerable spot or if you're really going to just be thinking about how disgusted they must be with your vag. One may be protecting you from the other. Sorry for the thought slurry. ",nan

It's actually an Inkbird temp controller, was 17.99 or so on Amazon. The way I have it wired is pretty straightforward. Hot, neutral, and ground from a monitor power cable. Hot is spliced from hot to terminal 1, and terminal 5, and to outlet that is going to be constant on. Neutral is spliced to terminal 2, and to heating outlet, and outlet that is constant on. Ground is simply spliced to both outlets. Temp probe connects to terminals 3 and 4. I use a 110 volt power supply that puts out 12 volts DC to power the fans. That's why I have the outlet for always on power, so I can run my fans all the time. Will try to come up with a drawing for you, probably going to be with MS paint though. Make sure that whatever insulated container you use is big enough to accept large egg turners. This cooler was bought from Amazon from some special promotion, for 24 bucks. It won't accept regular sized egg turners, so I have to use smaller ones. Only going to be doing a dozen or two at a time for a while, so it works. Other plans are to retrofit the box, and add an Inkbird humidity controller, with either a pond fogger, or a small humidifier to control the humidity levels more precisely. 
I'm in favor of the heat emitters over the light bulbs, but the more I look around, thinking about going with two ptc elements, mounted in front of the fans. Would take less room, and directly move the heat.
Quick edit: did the two fans and two heat sources strictly for redundancy. Read about a bulb blowing in the middle of the night, killing the eggs. I was told if you use bigger wattage heat sources (to a point) your temperature fluctuations will be shorter, ie: 120 watts gets you back to 100 degrees faster than 60 watts.
As far as holding heat, I have 4, individual quart Mason jars full of water, to help stabilize fluctuations in temperature. There will also be a tray with water and sponges to aid in humidity. Have been told about using clean rocks too. Idea being like an empty versus full fridge.",nan

You get more cores *and* newer CPU architecture than an Intel offering (plus, the chipset Intel uses for its latest CPU line is being phased out so there isn't much ""future proofing"" to be had). I'm not sure what your budget is like, but a Ryzen 5 1600/1600x can be had for ~$200 and a Ryzen 7 1700/1700x will run about $300.

The ""x"" versions of Ryzen processors come with faster stock clocks, but the non-x versions are perfectly capable of matching these clock speeds and generally are $20-30 cheaper. Overclocking these days is basically increasing some numbers on your UEFI screen but it does generally void your warranty. That being said, Ryzen processors have been shown to be very OC-friendly even with the stock cooler they come with.

tl;dr a Ryzen 5 1600 that you OC on your own can easily hit 4.0 GHz on the stock cooler it comes with and can be found for $200. It's a great option for single PC streaming. If you're feeling extra ritzy, spring for a Ryzen 7 1700 or 1800 and again, do the OC yourself. 

It should be noted that, compared to Intel processors at similar price points, Intel does (on average) get slightly better framerates. You can look at the comparison benchmarks online, but its very a very small difference. Additionally, with more games taking advantage of DX12 and multi-core functionality AND with Intel phasing out its current cpu chipset, I think an AMD Ryzen cpu is the best option if you are upgrading and especially if you are streaming. The price:performance ratio cannot be beaten.",nan

Recon is relatively easy to explain however but it takes discipline in practice. Basically, you should buy infantry versions and place a couple of them in green-level cover that has high LOS (press C key to see the spot's LOS); and preferably they should not be directly with your frontline troops as they will tend to die by arty fire. Also make sure to press H so that they hold fire and remain undetected. Basically think of them as observation posts.

If you're on the offensive you may want a recon armored car or a recon squad that's mounting and dismounting from an armored car placed slightly ahead of your main force.

That said, this is really a game where you can do a bit of guesswork due to the frontline mechanic. With experience you can rely on them a bit less. There's a game posted here that was played by a couple of top players:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Steel_Division/comments/68am70/a_look_into_mobile_meta_vs_fussel_great_game_with/

And the thing to notice is how both players - while still relying heavily on recon - were also willing to risk units unsupported by recon to create rapid advances.

For infantry it really depends on the Division. Ersatztruppen for instance are basically speed bumps on the defense or bottom-tier guys that you send forward to make the enemy reveal their positions (10 points for the location of your MGs? Fine trade if you ask me!). At the top end you have Fallschirmjaeger which can basically beat any infantry one v one but will die just as fast to arty. And then you have Half-track infantry like in 3AD, which basically have to be conserved due to their scarcity but can beat a lot of infantry in specific terrain thanks to their HT fire support. 

As a general rule in defense against a player with lots of artillery though: Have only one infantry in the main line of resistance. If you're defending a hedge for instance, have only one infantry in that hedge (and usually the cheapest one). Have everything else be be _behind_ that hedgeline - preferably spread out in different cover locations. 

The idea here is that your lone infantry is acting primarily as a spotter and as a damage sponge. If the infantry spots an attack, you can call in your own arty and air to damage them. If the enemy decides to bombard your hedge, then you only lose that one infantry (if at all) while the rest of your forces are still intact. If faced with an overwhelming attack, then don't be shy about running - said attack will soon find itself facing concentrated fire from the rest of your forces the moment they enter the hedge; allowing you to break it up and re-take your original defense line.",nan

I would take wasps over these guys ten times out of ten, Accidently clipped a nest with a shovel doing yard work and had two get me on the same pinky finger. 

Had to take some kind of prescribed medication to make the swelling go down ( can't remember what it's been years) it didn't work and i have had a fat finger ever since.

Give out the keys to other people and then go back later asking for a replacement key because you locked yours in your room. They'll give you another key. Do this twice if you want.

Team's playing with that PS4 had an overall record of 3-9.

The player's overall k/d on that PS4 (assuming it was the same all event) was .896.  I didn't bother with k/r.

Enable's k/d was .83 (bad PS4) vs 1.05 when he played on another PS4. His k/r was 19.44 (bad) vs 23.15 (other PS4).  Faze need work but it's always going to be tougher when one of your consistent players is underperforming to that extent. It creates a chain reaction.

I bought it six years ago, expecting to keep it for maybe 3-4 years, but I've still got it, and have no real intention of changing it, at least not until they make pre-Euro 6 diesel cars illegal and/or it rusts into nothing.

The engine is a bit rough, but I actually quite like that - you can feel it's a bit rough at 900rpm, and then you can feel it's a bit rough at 1200rpm, and then you can still feel it's about as rough as that (and barely more) at 4000rpm. Never gets old, for some reason.

Main problems are the rather average 0-60 time, and the plumes of thick, gelatinous, jet-black clag it spits out from the exhaust when you try to attain even that. Also, my car is silver, and who the fuck wants a silver car? But the latest engines fix the acceleration and smoke problems, and your car is a rather attractive shade of blue ;) - so what, as the saying goes, is not to like.

Makes sense.  Is it as simple as pulling off a pair of tires, or do you have to put on some kind of spacer or something?  Which pair comes off: inside or outside?  Also, is there a tire or rim difference between the inside and outside pair?  (Apologies for my ignorance in this area; it's my first dually.)

&gt; The studded snows are more safe in generally cold winter weather, then when conditions are bad enough that you can't go much more than 30 anyway, you put on your chains.

Also makes sense, but I haven't generally had an issue with traction in anything but conditions which necessitate slower speeds anyway.  I'm usually driving slower than I need to in adverse conditions.  If this is the case, is there a really compelling reason why I should still get studs?  I'm told that it impacts the overall life of the tire.  That, combined with the issue of legality in other states, makes me want to avoid it unless I have a need.  I *have* gotten stuck once this winter, but it was off the road in 2 feet of snow.  I'm thinking chains would have been better than studs there, anyway.",nan

The second you allow people to have such free streaming you open yourself up to a pandora's box of problems. The whole reason they added it in the first place was to deal with the people who would basically have a game in resolution 600x400 while they talk to viewers. They hated having to police so many streamers to make sure they were playing gaming content but this was not the answer. Think about all of the cancerous streamers, a whole lot of them are IRL (ice poseidon, tyler1, greek, andy milonakis, etc). What blows my mind further is the people who watch IRL sections. It's like reality TV but twice as boring. 



IRL section rewards streamers who put themselves in awkward and dangerous situations. When a streamer harasses a citizen minding his own business and it creates a scene, it's considered funny and pulls in more viewers and donation money. It's just sad.",nan

- You only have to pay a damage deposit. Not first and last.

I'd would be misleading to call myself gay or bisexual even though I'm definitely attracted to women.

5664,2017,8,dkzs5zp,nan,Naruto,1503656767,0,0,0,"Tsunade and Sakura are two people with a vast difference in battle experience between them. Sakura is not a clone of Tsunade, she is less. Tsunade used medical ninjutsu in battle in part one (lightning chakra messed up Kabuto's CNS). Kabuto exceeds her as well (chakra scalpel in battle). Sakura hasn't shown the kind of creativity that would tell me that she she can tackle challenges as they come. Naruto and Sasuke do this. They have also battled many people and showed us that they can develop creative uses of their abilities. Sakura simply masters the technique as it is invisioned.

Sakura may have the yin seal, but note that when someone has an essentially immortal body they become sloppy in their fighting style. Raikage told Tsunade this in their battle against Madara. If Sakura is forced to use her Yin Seal - which implies that she is getting hit without being able to land one on her opponent - then she likely becomes a sloppy fighter. Note that neither Tsunade nor Sakura just whip out the Yin Seal in battle. The battle has to have advanced enough for them to use it.

We see how Sakura battles a long-ranged opponent in her fight against Sasori. Her strategy is to dodge attacks at first, tank them if she can't, and get in a solid hit with her fist. That is her only attack. She has no other attack ability. How will she battle someone like Mei? Madara noted that he couldn't get hit by that level of ninjutsu as that spells trouble for him. Mei showed strategy in that she trapped Sasuke and used the acid mist on him. Sakura's strategy is creating infighting in teams. She misleads her opponents into thinking they have the upperhand (against Sasuke) or letting them believe they have outsmarted her (against Ino, which backfired).

Sakura hasn't used Katsuyu in any attack capability.

The issue is she simply not experienced enough to after Kage-level. She may have surpassed Tsunade according to characters in the manga, but she still cannot defeat Tsunade. There is Mei as well.

PS: I am not hating on her. I am trying to understand her capabilities and what she and other ninjas have to offer. Getting a punch on Kaguya is not proof of ninja ability. She helped Naruto and Sasuke seal her, but did not defeat her. Kaguya couldn't be defeated. Only sealed.

TL;DR: Sakura is not a creative ninja and not one that can tank ninjutsu abilities that even Madara didn't want to get caught in. Mei is superior to her. If she can't tank Mei's ninjutsu, then she can't get that hit in. And it looks like the Kage's all have high durability getting wacked around by Susano, so Sakura's hit might not be an end-all.",nan

At a tech rehearsal for my school's musical, there were these two girls who would always crowd around the sound booth and annoy me and my crew. They would always talk to a girl on my crew about random crap, and when I asked them to leave, they would always give me this glare and continue talking. I'm a junior, and those two girls are freshmen, so it was really frustrating that they weren't listening. On this particular day however, I was through with their shit. It was about 9 in the morning and those two girls were annoying my crew while we were setting up. I asked them nicely, out of desparation to just leave me and my crew alone for the duration of rehearsal until showtime, but they said, ""We're never going away, and there isn't anything you can do about it,"" followed by the same, smug smirk across their ugly faces. I couldn't take anymore of this. It was too early in the day, and I was sick and tired of this happening. My face turned very red, and I yelled as loud as I could, ""GET THE FUCK OUT! GET. THE. FUCK. OUT! I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU TWO ANYWHERE NEAR MY CREW AGAIN OR ELSE THIS WILL BE YOUR LAST FUCKING REHEARSAL EVER! YOU TWO HAVE BEEN THE MOST AGGRAVATING PEOPLE I'VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! NOW FUCK OFF!"" The two girls were dead quiet, and their crew head, who was nearby, told them to leave me and my crew alone. Apparently I was so loud that everyone in the hallway I was in heard it, and for about an hour, most of them stayed away from me.

Also IMO the insistence on calling any kind of orgasm that extends beyond the penis/genitals as a ""girlgasm"" is going to lead many to believe that experiencing a whole body orgasm with a penis is an automatic sign that they are trans, by making a false-positive case for dysphoria.  It enforces the same rigid and outmoded gender/sex roles that cause problems for trans people to begin with.

Now that's not particularly the paragon of empirism, don't you think?



I would say it depends on the time. Aspects of Empiricism (or the concepts that would later become Empiricism) were integrated into a Catholic philosophy/method of thought by Thomas Aquinas.



In addition, this is for monastics, effectively the guys who the the people who effectively spend most of their time in religious contemplation (the people who will most have their heads in the ""bronze age books""). 

Clerics Regular (ordered priests) and Frairs were more likely the ones to do scientific research, as their vocation to serve God tended to be expressed in more ""direct"" ways.


&gt;We REALLY have to wait for the dawn of the 16th century for the first notably scientific accomplishments in Europe.

 

Accomplishments such as what, distinguishing them from the previous centuries?



Also, if we are going with scientific advances circa 16th century, the Jesuits have been described as ""the single most important contributers to expirimental physics in the 17th century"".

It was all about walking the straight line within the very narrow boudaries of theological doctrine: THIS is how you must think and if not, you are a heretic. And the peasants and shepherds of Montaillou weren't even infidels or pagans - they just adhered to Catharism, another flavour of Christianity.



Thats not neccessarily better under Christian ethos.

It would make the game lame if it tried to hold the user/players hand by either dumping the contents on the ground, or giving an error message like ""stuff inside cant destroy."" 80% of the gameplay of this game is managing reagents an materials and intimately knowing your tools and workshop.  

Unless theres some enchanment you can cast on items so that they're aware of their contents and shout ""no I'm full! also plz don't destroy me I have a wife and kids,"" when you try to destroy them, why would a chest/table know or care or behave that way? 

&gt; as that's kinda bullshit.

Not in a game like Citadel its not, it makes sense that destroying a container destroys whats inside it. In a game like World of Warcraft, or Barbie Pony Adventure where the goal is to make sure the users feelings aren't hurt, it would be bullshit. 


**DEVELOPERS LOOKIE HERE** EDIT:  just to be clear, when I was typing out that part about an enchantment on ingame items that makes them act sentient and tell you what they have in them or not to destroy them, I was leaning more towards ""cool shit that would work well in this game."" and less towards being a sarcastic asshole. I literally think you guys should embrace the cartoon aesthetic, and include spells for animating/enchanting inanimate objects, to take commands like tames, and make the game world more magicky. It fits with the fantasy theme you've got going on so far, think 'Fantasia' with the army of brooms. Theres a VR game out by the people behind rick and morty called ""Accounting"" and it has this tree person yelling at you to get out of his tree world, thats another good reference, I want to make doors that say ""Hey, who goes there?"" and chairs that walk away from you saying ""No please, not again."" and Wall Torches that ask if it's warm in here.

Others that might work well include TFP, Raid Solo (bonus damage to enemies with &lt;50% tm), Ugnaught, FOST with Zeta , Kylo (would do more damage for each time he's hit and if others died before enrage and he got to attack, could hit insanely hard from the DoT),  Mace (self heal if below 50%), Shore or Sunfac (for crit chance down), Nebit (for protection up), Pao (multi attacks).

Other ideas, Use tenacity up so people don't get DoT. Then if people die and you get turns before enrage, then rest won't instantly die. With tenacity up, Ezra could be good. If you have, say Ezra and/or Sabine you could also try chopper to provide additional buffs.",nan

I'm not talking about any groups who may have fought against them, I'm talking about the fact that Antifa's tactics exactly match the very group they hate.

EVERYONE'S tactics match the group they are are fighting, unless they have a superior tactic available to them. 

""They bombed Pearl Harbor, so we bombed them? We are the REAL monsters!""

""Oh my god, the police are in the street with weapons, making a scene! They're just as bad as the gang they're fighting!""

&gt;Additionally (in all fairness I did edit my last comment, so maybe you missed it) - the Antifa are not fighting actual Nazis like what your grandfather did.

You mean they're not fighting Nazis with an army behind them? They are fighting the same ideology. And tell me, as clearly you think their tactics are too extreme -- how many people has antifa killed so far? How many people have Neonazis killed?

&gt;And, again - don't sully your grandfathers reputation by putting these cowardly Antifa on the same plain as him. Remember, your grandfather would have also had great disdain for these largely socialist/communist/Marxist/Leninist sympathizers.

**BUNNAHABHAIN 12**
**ABV:** 46.3%
**Bottle Opened:** 2 weeks
**Source:** Purchased locally for 62 USD

**Tasting methodology:**
I pour 2oz neat into a Glencairn at room temperature and promptly shove my nose in the glass for a first impression. After a moment I take my first sip, again, just looking for first impressions.

I then let the glass sit for 10 minutes or so and come back for a more thoughtful examination. I will sometimes add a bit of filtered water after several sips neat. If so, this is noted in the review.

**Color:**
[1.2 chestnut oloroso sherry.](http://malt-review.com/2015/09/10/whisky-flavour-wheels-and-colour-charts/) Perfectly clear with no sediment.

**First Impression:**
Nose is sherry and dark caramel. A bit more heat than the proof might suggest. First sip is sweet malt with typical sherry notes. Ripe cherries, a vat of red grapes stomped into juice, the faintest whiff of smoky peat. Mouthfeel is silky and rich. Finish brings a touch of baking spice, vanilla, oak barrel notes.

**After 10 minutes:**
Still a lot of sherry on the nose, but now also smelling roasted nuts, baking spices, over-ripe plums. Palate is quite complex. Malted grain sweetness, warm buttered toast, faint peat, a touch of burnt caramel, all under a bowl of smashed grapes, cherries, plums, and currants left out in the sun. Perfect mouthfeel. It coats without being sticky or cloying.

**Finish:**
Finish is straightforward with lingering sweetness and sherry. There is a touch of red-wine, tannic dryness, pepper, and a hint of salty sea-air.

**Overall:**
This is my first whisky from Bunnahabhain, and I'm very glad I picked it up. A much more nuanced Islay than the powerhouses from the likes of Ardbeg or Laphroaig. Looking forward to letting this one sit for s bit to see what some open time does for it. Solid, and very enjoyable.

**Scoring:**
- First Impression: 82/100
- Nose: 87/100
- Palate: 85/100
- Finish: 82/100

**Final Score: 84/100**

**Scoring Interpretation:**
- **0-59:** What is this? Yuck! Is this a joke?! Did I lose a bet?!

- **60-69:** Meh... glad I tried it so I have the palate experience, but I'm not gonna chase this down again.

- **70-79:** Nothing to get overwrought about, but if the price is right, I'd drink this any time.

- **80-89:** Fantastic! I want a bottle on my bar all the time.

- **90-94:** Truly amazing. A special treat I will savor when I can.

- **95-100:** Have yet to taste something I'd rate here. Ever optimistic I guess.

Thanks for reading. Again, I welcome any feedback you might have. Next up... more here on r/scotch.

Exactly. That said, I probably don't support ISIS at all.

&gt; i think their interpretation can be defended

OK, so as an apologist for ISIS, how do you defend:

- ignoring Muhammed's use of a sword when there is very clear evidence within the hadiths that he used a sword for executions?

- burning people to death when there is overwhelming evidence in the hadiths that Muhammed was opposed to this punishment? Most ISIS apologists justify this by way of the one or two hadiths in which he seemed to have agreed with burning, but fail to explain how they reconcile this with the majority of hadith that condemn burning.

- not collecting the *jizya* when it is one of the first commandments within Islam. There is, to my knowledge, only one ""suspected"" case of ISIS having collected the jizya, but I question the authenticity of that report.

1. It is important to remember that not everyone who lives through a dangerous event develops PTSD. PTSD also does not always equal aggression. Many people with it have avoidance symptoms, flashbacks, trouble sleeping, reactivity emotions and/or somatic reactions.  

2. You know one great way to treat PTSD? Talk therapy. Being able to talk through his anxieties, fears and rationale with Jessica have seemed to really benefit Cody. We see him reflecting a lot, showing emotions and learning to be vulnerable the longer he stays in that house. 

3. We don't even know if he has PTSD, but he if he does, going on the show mightily greatly impact his life. He said he was miserable with his life before coming on the show. Perhaps this show will lead to a breakthrough for him, open doors and really allow for him to reflect on his life. People with PTSD deserve grace and hope.

6211,2017,5,dgyvle8,nan,NeverBeGameOver,1494516285,0,0,0,"Very interesting, my friend. 

There is a lot to consider here. But dying and ''coming back'' to life has always been a major theme in the MGS saga for one. Dead soldiers being brought back from the darkness. Gray Fox, Big Boss etc. ''Neither enemy, nor friend. I am back from a world, where such words are meaningless''

The paralels to Silent Hills have always fascinated me and which is why I always liked theories pointing to MGSV being in Jacks head. Like many, one of the first theories I had was the coma dream theory. 

Silent Hill 2 which you mentioned, which was James Sunderlands personal tailored-made hell.. constantly reminding him of the pain, guilt and angst he had because of what he had done. Similarly I've thought MGSV could then maybe be viewed as Jacks personal hell, or purgatory for a better analogy. And what would that look like really, what form would it take? Maybe stuck in an endless state of nuclear-fueled conflict, killing the same faceless man over and over again. Old and long dead enemies and dead friends appearing, the taking of child soldiers including the appearence of Liquid who later also dies because of his actions.. the Shining Lights mission does read like an intense nightmare. The guilt of having gotten all of your own men killed, which is what allegedly happened at Ground Zeroes. And if he was in a coma dream right after having experienced that along with his history.. well. If you view MGSV as Jacks guilt-ridden nightmare the plot of MGSV makes a lot of sense to me.

I'm not saying that this is what happened, but it's an interesting thought for sure. Good job putting this together OP, I love reading stuff like this.  ",nan

Ours is only one of ~100 billion stars in our galaxy, which has been around for ~13.2 billion years. That seems like plenty of time for other intelligent beings to evolve and gain spaceflight capability.

But, the earth has only been around for ~4.5 billion years, Homosapians have only been around for 200,000, and recorded history only goes back (dramatic pause) 5,000 years!

It's been about 100 years since Marconi, so if the aliens visited after detecting our earliest radio broadcasts, they must have been within a sphere with a ~50 light-years radius*, a volume of space that contains only 133 stars! Intelligent life may not be unique to Earth, but it's probably much less than 2-in-133.

What if they didn't come because of our radio signals? Maybe they were just exploring? OK, but now you have to look at how many stars there are in our galaxy, and the tiny little blip of time that Humans have been living on the Earth, and recording history. The aliens would have to have fantastic luck to have visited us in just the narrow span of time that we were around.

(*) Our radio signals have traveled 100 light years, but any aliens more than 50 light years away wouldn't have arrived here yet, even traveling at near light speed.",nan

I looked up the McDonalds you are talking about and the reason the owner pays more is because there is a lot of jobs in the community because of the oil boom. In many parts of the country, there is no oil boom to drive up the wages. The example you are giving is anecdotal. 

The 3.9% you are throwing around is based on the federal minimum wage, if you take into account the amount of people making minimum wage (according to the local wage) then the number would go up. Places like LA and New York are super expensive to live in. 

And the arbitrary number made up by the government your talking about, right after the minimum wage is increased, the economy tends to improve, so the government increasing the minimum wage is better for the economy compared to the free market negotiations you are talking about. The link below basically says that a government mandated minimum wage increase lead to unemployment falling by 17%. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/03/16/we-are-seeing-the-effects-of-seattles-15-an-hour-minimum-wage/#509594eb3a22    

And you third point, did you even look at the link I had, Luxxotica owns Sears Optical and Target Optical. The other brand names you named sell Ray-bans and other brans which are owned by Luxxotica.

And for the forth point, GDP is not a accurate measure of how the economy is doing, even the person who came up with the concept said that. And the unemployment figure is also not a good way to get a pulse on the economy since people who want full time employment but work part time because of the lack of opportunities will be counted as employed. I do have to admit that I may have underestimated the amount of sales taken over by online retailers and I was completely unaware of the over saturation of malls. Maybe it's time to turn them into parks or something. ",nan

canada post can open your non lettermail packages any time they want without a warrant i used to think otherwise but they can and they have people whos jobs it is to do so, random mail carriers will not be doing it that being said their job is to deliver packages and with them barely making a profit and being understaffed and overworked checking random packages falls pretty low on their priority.

I have no qualms about criticizing the company.  It's pointless to rant and whine.  However, there's no reason someone who supports them cannot want them to improve and express valid criticisms because they'd like to see their investment in a new platform yield some enjoyment.

Mon verdict pour l'instant (Les choses peuvent changer):

Il est impossible que PKP n'ait pas les moyens de se doter des meilleurs conseillers que le fric puisse acheter. Mais il n'a pas encore démontré qu'il a l'humilité et la sagesse d'utiliser leurs conseils.

En ce qui me concerne, c'est une faiblesse mortelle. La première décision que doit prendre un nouveau PM, et la plus importante de son mandat, c'est de nommer son conseil des ministres. Je ne vois pas (jusqu'à présent) PKP mettre la meilleure personne à la bonne place **et mettre son ego de côté** pour accepter leurs décisions dans leurs ministères après qu'ils aient étudié les dossiers avec les meilleurs infos disponibles si elle lui semblent contre intuitives. Il ne sait pas déléguer. Faiblesse mortelle pour un PM.

Pour notre bien à tous, il est essentiel que s'il est jamais élu PM, il ait d'abord aquis cette humilité, appris à écouter ses conseillers, et appris à déléguer.

That being said, the Asiatic hordes idea comes from the assumption of Russia (quickly growing in power/population) was not really white but mongols. It's hard to distinguish hatred of Russians from genuine fear of an invasion, because they called Russians ""Untermensh"" but they also called Churchill and Roosevelt ""Untermensch"".

1- Was that sarcasm? We've been over this, democracy and fascism are mutually exclusive. The UK has a functioning representative democracy. Honestly, it tends to misrepresent its population because of the way their voting system works but it's still effective. And just because it has a Queen and a House of Lords doesn't make it any less democratic, their roles are almost purely ceremonial. 
 
6-The media is not bought and paid for, otherwise why does fox spend so much time criticizing the most powerful man in the country? And what about foreign news?  Do the Koch brothers own the British government and dictate what the BBC can and can't report on? Or Al Jazeera?

9-Lobbying and making laws are different things. True, companies spend fortunes on lobbying groups, but that doesn't mean that they'll always be successful. Look at net neutrality, some of the most powerful lobbies are telecommunications groups like comcast and time warner, the current head of the FCC used to be a comcast lobbyist, but net neutrality still won out. They may be able to get laws to favor them, but to say they make the laws simply isn't true. 

12-I agree that one of the biggest problems with the U.S. now is the prison system, and it needs to change. But I have confidence that just like so many other problems of the past like

-big monopolies (Teddy Roosevelt and his trust busting) 

-poor sanitation in meat factories (The Jungle) 

-and hell, even segregation can be fixed by internal reform.  

14-I agree that Citizens United vs FEC ruling was bull, and that super pacs are bad for democracy, but democracy still happens. People vote, not corporations. And Politicians can't actually spend any of the super pac money themselves, it all has to be spent for them, so there's still a layer of disconnect. 

There are things wrong with the country and the government, but they're fixable and they certainly aren't indicative of a new fascist regime. Two hundred years of history are a testament to that. ",nan

6497,2017,5,dgz1tx7,nan,CompetitiveHS,1496158037,0,0,0,"Auctioneer is actually the defining card for Miracle Rogue. The whole idea of Miracle Rogue as a deck is to try to create very powerful swing turns. Using certain combinations of cards to answer the board or get ahead. In particular, Auctioneer is really good at this. Between Counterfeit Coin, Backstab, and Prep, you can find a lot of ways to chain several spells together and draw several cards. Miracle Rogue often does play from behind on board, it's just that these ""miracle"" turns are extremely powerful and can really turn a game on its head very quickly. Sherazin and Edwin both combo well with multiple cards in a turn, and Arcane Giants also benefit from your crazy Auctioneer turns. The game is often defined by a single turn switching you to a now ""in the lead"" position.

Tempo Rogue is more about getting on board early and using efficient cards to keep yourself ahead. Argent Squire is a pretty medium card, but it's very good at contesting early board control and for comboing. It's a different play style because it's more aggressive and less combo oriented. You just want to keep deploying minions that help you contest the board and stay ahead.

Miracle Rogue beats Hunter by fighting well for the board early. You want to draw cards like SI:7, Backstab, Swashburgler, Eviscerate, and Razorpetal Lasher. Even Fan of Knives and Edwin can be good in certain situations. You contest the board as best as you can early and then hope that by the mid game, you're drawing things like Auctioneer or Vilespine Slayer which really help put on the pressure and close out the game. Hunter is a class that generally has to be winning board early to put enough damage through. They have ways to close out the game with their hero power and spells like Kill Command, but those only work under the assumption they pushed enough damage.",nan

Russians are directly supporting the SAA, and if you look at the map you can see who the SAA is fighting and why. In the areas where they are engaging ISIS, Russians are bombing ISIS. By and large, the SAA is prioritizing other rebel groups right now - once again, why that is the case is clearly and obviously seen on any conflict map.

Bio: Smith joined the Resistance shortly after gaining a high-ranking position in the ADVENT Government. He'd done a good job with public relations, always convincing those around him that ADVENT were a force for good. With his new position and devout loyalty, the Aliens allowed Smith to travel aboard one their interstellar vessels for a short time beyond Earth, sure that he would return with more material to his stump speech about ""the Aliens glory and the grand future of the Human Race"". Contrary to this, he came back a different man. He had seen but a glance beyond the veil, but it was all he needed. Within a week of his return, he disappeared from his apartment in New Chicago and arrived on our doorstep, determined to help XCOM free humanity's hands to grasp the stars.

But the idea of it is to alert whatever intruders were coming in to everything in the dungeon.


The trick is that one on every row was labeled ""null"" and so no compulsion/music played when stepping on that tile. So they needed to either guess or know celestial to get through.

It looks like you're trying to compare proportions across months (homogeneity of proportions). A chi-square and a Fisher test would both ignore the information in the month-ordering, but I guess if you have power to spare that's no big issue. 

I don't think it makes sense to compare all pairs of months; do you really want to do pairwise comparisons? I'd have thought if anything some kind of identification for shifts over time would make sense. How many months do you have? ",nan

The problem was, it was pretty overpriced, so I left and went to a different store, that was literally across the street from the other one. Inside I'm taking a look around, and lo and behold, I see the same sofa, for $250 less. I thought that that was a crazy margin, and checked to make sure it was the same one, which it was, and everything about it was the same. I took a picture of it, and lifted up the seat(because under those seats, they have all the information on it), and took a picture of that. When I went to the first store, I showed them all the evidence, and when theproposed some scenario, I refuted it with photo evidence. Apparently, the sofas were the exact same, and I'm pretty sure the store manager thought that was impossible, and he refused to price match until I brought up all the photographs. He then price matched it to the same price, walked off kind of pissed, and then I go home with a cheaper sofa.

TL;DR: Found a place with a cheaper sofa(same model), manager was shocked/enraged, price matched, I saved $250.

And the reason I didn't just buy it from the second store was because the saleswoman at the first store was really kind, and I had a nice conversation with her while looking at furniture. Just wanted her to get some of the commission money(I know she would've gotten more if I hadn't price matched, but hey, no matter how nice she was, I'm not going to spend an extra $250 on a sofa.)",nan

2. For the rest of the day (or until the target is dead), add your Cha mod to attack rolls. 

3. If you hit, add your paladin level to damage.  
 3a. If your target is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, this bonus is doubled on the first attack that hits.

4. Ignore all DR the smited creature has.

5. You gain a bonus to AC equal to your Cha mod against the smited target.

Example:  Level 5 paladin with 16 cha (+3 mod), BAB 5 and 18 strength with a longsword.

* Smite an angel: not an evil target, smite is lost.

* Smite an evil orc: Rolls 1d20+5(BAB)+4(str mod)+3(cha mod) to hit. If he hits, he deals 1d8+4(str mod)+5(paladin level) damage.

* Smite a red dragon: Rolls 1d20+5(BAB)+4(str mod)+3(cha mod) to hit.  If he hits, deal 1d8+4(str mod)+10(paladin level doubled) on first hit. Subsequent hits deal 1d8+4(str mod)+5(paladin level).",nan

I'm no longer in Minnesota, but I can have my mom do a bit of the research since she's just as invested in this as I am. She should have better luck since she's in the town where most of the records are issued (I think.) I guess I'll busy myself with finding out information in Logansport.

I don't think its related because I'm always looking with purpose and focused on aim points, where in PUBG I'm just scanning the room as fast as possible for loot. In third person you can walk into a room and see 180 plus degrees around you at all times, making it much easier to scan without camera movement. In first person you'll have much reduced FOV and I don't think being closer to the ground will help (if that even is a benefit at all). Reduced FOV means more camera movement to scan the same space. I mean, if you actually thought it was better I'd ask if you currently loot in first person at all right now, particularly early game when you think its safe... because I sure as hell don't and don't know anyone who does. I think first person mode will definitely bring something new to the game and change the dynamics of both shooting and looting, but I don't think it'll make looting *easier* in any way.

In general they aren't addictive substances and you'll definitely feel the next day that you don't want to repeat the experience for a while (just your mind is exhausted). To me, psychedelics are the most amazing tool to discover and identify problems that have been bothering me for some time, reflect on my personality and take steps to change anything, enjoy the world cause it looks tremendously different tripping, and still live the 60s dancing, laughing, watching weird stuff, and listening to music in a room with neon lights and lava lamps . I've done a bunch on my time in college and they've all had different effects:

LSD: The best drug because of the length of trip, the effects experienced, and the ease to buy/purchase from a RELIABLE source from darkweb. Don't buy acid on street, or if you do test it with a test kit. Most of the street/rave acid today is NBOMe which is similar to LSD but with unpleasant body effects and a much lower lethal dose. Visually the world is crawling in fractals, colors are brighter, and when you close your eyes fantastic neon patterns appear like a kaleidoscope. You don't see elephants or insects (that's from deliriants) but you experience the world in a new way. Cognitively your brain ""opens up"" so you feel emotions amplified to the extreme, deep introspection and the ability to see your fears and insecurities, and a general sense of euphoria at how beautiful the world looks. Never had bad trips on acid, always felt content and upbeat. You won't be able to try the next day because your body builds superbly high tolerance. You'd wait minimum a week for another dose of acid to do the same effects.

Shrooms: Similar effects to LSD but the visuals and emotions are much more natural and organic feeling. Shrooms makes me want to put on some Floyd, draw, and be more creative and fit into nature; acid makes me fix inner issues and dedicate effort to meditate and reflect. Shrooms are easier to obtain than LSD but ingesting them is disgusting. They taste weird and every time I try them I end up vomiting slightly afterwards as the trip begins.

DMT: Makes LSD look like a margarita against DMT's everclear shot. On DMT you literally lose yourself to your brain. This is the drug that on 3 hits I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience and when I closed my eyes I saw otherworldly landscapes and scenery so vivid it was like real life. When you breakthrough it's the most WTF experience because I saw the figures of gods, aliens, demons, communicating with me telepathically and showing me around the place. If LSD/shrooms takes you into the rabbit hole, DMT drops you into a wormhole to a different dimension.

DPH: Just chug a bottle or two of Benadryl. Scariest moment of my life. Shadows moving around, eerie hallucinations, and strong negative body effects like dry mouth and red eyes. It completely makes you lose touch of reality and actually see things that aren't there. In my case I felt I was living a Courage the Cowardly Dog episode. Never doing it again.

Datura: This stuff is so bad hardly anyone reports anything better than a harrowing psychotic experience, not to mention it makes bath salts look tame. Will never touch ever in my life or any reincarnations. ",nan

7098,2017,5,dgz0fus,nan,TheColorIsBlue,1496157367,0,0,0,"**Pope to Venezuela: avoid more violence, respect human rights - The Washington Post**


VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis appealed to leaders of Venezuela’s government and society Sunday to avoid more violence after four weeks of political turmoil that has produced a mounting number of dead, injured and arrests.


Francis told faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square that, united in sorrow with the families of victims, he was making a heartfelt appeal to “the government and all the components of the Venezuelan society so that every further form of violence is avoided, human rights are respected and negotiated solutions are sought.”


The comments came a day after Francis, the first Latin American pope, expressed frustration that Vatican-sponsored negotiations to resolve Venezuela’s political impasse had not succeeded, in part because of what he cited as divisions within the opposition.


 “All that can be done for Venezuela must be done with the needed guarantees, otherwise we are just making fun of each other and the thing won’t work,” he told reporters traveling with him from Egypt. He said any negotiations under the Holy See’s auspices would require “very clear conditions.”


Venezuela’s opposition broke off the talks in December, saying the government had failed to meet a litany of demands that included release of political prisoners and setting a new date for cancelled gubernatorial elections.


The collapse of those talks has made it harder for the two sides to re-engage during the latest unrest, with the opposition galvanizing an outpouring of public anger with socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who they blame for widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation.


In a public letter to Francis on Sunday, the opposition dismissed the notion that there are divisions within its ranks and outlined its key demands that have been behind the almost daily protests that have already claimed 29 deaths.


 “The only dialogue acceptable in Venezuela today is the dialogue of voting, which is the only way to overcome the crisis and re-establish Venezuela’s kidnapped democracy,” the Democratic Unity alliance said.

People with perfect GPAs in high school have failed college physics, people with shitty grades in high school have gone on to physics PhDs. I recommend you talk to some professors or grad students, maybe the physics community/society in your school, learn about the general process and ways to prepare for a PhD track in undergrad. That being said you're just going in so it's really, really good to be proactive so early--it will help you a lot--but don't forget that you've got plenty of time, and you'll be adjusting to a new environment etc. Make your studies a priority but don't sacrifice your mental or physical health--that goes both for binging on booze and drugs as well as not sleeping and being constantly stressed.

Also don't put anybody up on a pedestal, or any field. It's all relative imo, and all you'll do is make yourself anxious and upset. There is a pseudo-hierarchy of fields in physics in terms of ""eliteness"" but seriously don't give a shit about it.

They closed stores in my city one at a time.

After that, they were fired and the process began again with a new store. 

My store was one of the last to be closed in my city. Nobody gave any shits about anything. Movies would spend days and days in a huge bin to be re-stocked after customers turned them in, with nobody caring enough to actually do it until the store manager asked us to. ",nan

Baseball pitchers fuck with baseballs, hitters cork bats, etc.  Soccer players take dives to draw penalties.  In the NFL you got stuff like spygate and deflategate (which was widely accepted as common practice in the league.) You could talk to people inside about basically any sport and they can give you an example of how people cheat.

All that said, wrestling is possibly the most potent example I can think of.  You hear stories about guys who never shower because they want their stench to be unbearable for their opponent.  When I was like 8 they taught me when to dig my chin in my opponents spine to break his posture. Within the sport there is very little moral condemnation when it comes to bending the rules.

7271,2016,2,czj7xqd,nan,DestinyTheGame,1458210110,0,1,0,"TL:DR it just makes more sense to have the enemy preoccupied with our smaller forces than to gather a large one and clear out a singular place.

Ive got to imagine that the moon is still occupied by the hive because many guardians dont want a rehash of what happened when crota took it in the first place. I mean story wise there is only 1 guardian thats doing these incredible things and that guardian has 5 friends that they tend to take on the big missions and 2 on strikes and smaller missions. 

So with the few guardians that do venture to the moon, its not a sizable enough force to take it. As well as, currently, story wise, it doesnt really make sense to take the moon. We have enough of a presence along with the fallen to halt of slow the hive and taking out the major leadership keeps them scratching their heads. 

To actually take the moon we would probably have to pull efforts and assets from other places in the solar system which effectively would give the enemies occupying those places time to regroup. Also, we would need to have occupations and leadership on the moon to stop them, again, drawing from resources Guardians may not have in troves to spare in doing so.


Ps: i absolutely hate that we have not cleared the moon. Especially the one guardian from our first mission, his body is still there when you patrol, like wtf bungie. Send someone to retrieve our fallen guardian.",nan

7286,2017,5,dgz0nih,nan,AskAnAmerican,1496157470,0,0,0,"Ah, yeah, sorry about bogging down the marriage bit without some context. I forget that the details aren't likely spread beyond US shores, but basically, the bruhahah here stemmed from the fact that marriage in the US confers a number of benefits (and ironically artificial rights) that are not obtainable by living together. It's largely a consequence of using marriage (in the traditional monogamous, abrahamic religion sense) as a short cut for ""committed, long term cohabitation arrangement"" in the various laws conferring those benefits

With respect to the ""requirements of a third person"", they key in your statement was ""depending on your beliefs"". This is where the distinction between marriage as a religious event and marriage as a social construct conflict. To be ""married"" as a social construct requires no involvement of third parties, except where you're seeking societal benefits from marriage, where we then get into the ""positive rights"" discussion again. Without those artificial benefits, whether or not any third party is willing to be involved in your marriage is completely besides the point, as it has no impact on you one way or the other.

As a religious construct, however, now we get into an obvious dependency on a third party, and here is one of those messy cases where the negative rights have come conflict. At it's base level, a religious organization is a social construct not unlike a base society or government. It has rules of behavior, usually some form of authority for resolving conflict (whether spiritual or otherwise) and often requires the sacrifice of negative rights in exchange for some benefit (physical or otherwise). It is also (ignoring for the moment theocracies) a completely voluntary association. As such, by the argument of negative rights, you can associate or not as you choose and you may subject yourself to those rules (or not) as you choose but no one can force you to do so.

However, what if your beliefs require you to partake in the ceremonies of a religious order (like getting married), but they refuse to allow you (because you're gay). Well, with just negative rights, you're SOL. Your beliefs are a voluntary thing that you have chosen, and your failure to live up to your beliefs (assuming they're supposedly the same as the religious order you're attempting to participate in) is also a voluntary action on your part, one which no one may deny you. But likewise, their beliefs require them to not certify your marriage, and you can not deny them their beliefs or compel them to act against them either.

This is a fundamental principle behind the US 1st amendment freedom of religion. It's not only supposed to be a bulwark against turning the US into a theocratic state, but it's also a bulwark against people outside the voluntary arrangements of a religious order being able to compel them to violate their beliefs.

If we create a ""right to marry"", and we apply it to all religious orders, what we have done is create a positive right (the right to be married under the auspices of a religious order), and placed it above a number of negative rights (freedom of association, freedom of religion, personal autonomy etc). Further still we're stepping on the negative rights of a number of people (the entire religious order) because a smaller group (in this case the two seeking marriage) want the benefits of the voluntary association, without adhering to the ""social contract"" of that association.

So far we (in the US) are reluctant to go down that road, even where we have created positive rights around marriage. The gay marriage debate settled the legal and ""social"" version of marriage, but left the religious construct largely untouched. However, there is a fear among the religious groups (and not entirely unreasonable given the degree to which we are becoming comfortable with creating positive rights in this country) that at some point in the future, the positive right to marriage will take precedence over the negative right of freedom of religion. Personally I think it's quite unlikely to occur in this country, but if we continue to think of positive rights as the same as negative rights with the same costs and consequences, then it's certainly a possibility.

To your last question, in a lot of ways, yes negative rights are contingent on ability and circumstance. Let's go to the very basics and do a philosophical exercise. The most fundamental of natural and negative rights, is the Right to Life (not the abortion debate version). Almost every modern society recognizes this right, and indeed the founding philosophy of the US is that such a right is yours by nature (or endowed by your creator) and as such even if the government didn't recognize it, you would still have it.

But what does that mean in reality? If you are born in a desert shack, and your mother dies in child birth and your father dies from a snake bite trying to get help, your right to life as an infant is more of less meaningless because you don't have the ability to do anything to maintain it. If you survived, and grew up, you still would have to grow your own food and find your own water, and if you couldn't, right to life or not you would die.

Now imagine that you live in your desert and along comes a new person. You're starving, and you have a right to life. Does this mean you can kill them and eat them? Almost all people and societies say no, you might have your right to life, but so do they.

What if instead, they knew how to grow food. Does your right to life allow you to compel them to grow food for you if you are unable? That is actually something modern societies debate in the abstract. But we could turn it around too. Say they had the knowledge, but hand mangled hands. Does their right to life allow them to compel you to labor to produce food for them and you?

Now what if they already have food? Here is an interesting point. In many societies, there are leniencies and extenuating circumstances for theft in the event of imminent starvation. This is largely a matter of moral and justice, but what does it mean for our rights discussion? Most societies recognize another negative right, which is that of the right to property. But in some societies, when rights begin to conflict, we start ""ranking"" them. So it might be that your right to life ranks higher than their right to property, and so you may indeed steal.

A doctrine of negative rights honestly doesn't deal with this at all. In simply states that there are some ""rights"" which all people have by virtue of existing, which they possess and which in theory can not and should not be infringed by any other person. And it recognizes that for these ""negative"" rights, avoiding infringement is merely the act of not acting against those rights.

Because, as you can see, this means that your negative rights may or may not be of ""use"" to you depending on your circumstances, we build societies and governments to attempt to secure those rights and create the circumstances such that all members can exercise those rights. Which leads us right back to most of these societies are contingent upon sacrificing small amounts of your negative right (say to property) in exchange for new ""positive"" rights (like a right to food and water) that allow others to take advantage of their own negative rights.

Or basically, the TLDR version is, yes they are contingent on ability and circumstance and that is why government exists.

And again, I'm not making or trying to pass any moral judgement on whether these positive rights should or shouldn't exist. That is largely a question for each individual society to determine as their members see fit, based on the degree of sacrifice of their natural rights they're willing to make. Another topic for another day, this is also why I also prefer many small societies as opposed to a single global or national one.

Again, hopefully that rambling wall of text answered you question. Feel free to keep asking if you have more.",nan

This does hold to what you stated though, ""every politician and POTUS has done this.""

Basically you can get plans set up to garnish 10% of your disposable income  for 20 years. When people drop out of school they end up making 30k-40k a year, 10% of that persons disposable income for 20 years is nothing relative to the 40k-70k that they borrowed.

To be fair, it was on a left-hand-threaded bicycle pedal that my stepson had carefully spent all afternoon ""loosening"" the wrong way before he asked for help, and he was plenty strong.  I think he ended up trading the whole crankset for something different, pedals included -- it was *stuck*, and I'd just broken the only correct tool I had which might have been able to help.

It's the only wrench out of my go-to Chinesium (actually Indium) kit which has been around for over a decade has ever had any difficulty.  The rest have behaved perfectly and have always stubbornly removed fasteners easily-ish and without any damage to the tool or the fastener.

The whole set was $12 at TSC.  I adore them as being amongst the most practical purchases I've ever made.  They seem to be very fine tools.  (HF sells these, too, sometimes-but-not-always.  The key is the made-in-India nomenclature on the back of the plastic tool holder.)

I've damaged more tools by accidentally welding them with high-current DC than by mechanical force.  YMMV, though, especially with infamously-tight axle nuts (the Jesus Nut, as my BMW E36 and E30 comrades call it).

I still think the lift would typically have more force available than the weight of the car, though, but I do not know typical lift specifications and I am merely guessing as to its capabilities.

A different, less scary method that is a variation of the two:  A bottle jack, a breaker bar, and the car on the ground so that it cannot fall very far?  Possibly with three of four of the biggest people you can immediately borrow crammed into the area inside the vehicle that is nearest to that particular axle end?",nan

When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the will be marked as completed.

This is a(n) image post, so please use the following formatting:

---

**Art:**
---

A picture is worth a thousand words, though you definitely don't need to use that many to describe the image. Please attempt to just give a general idea of what the image is. For example, ""A man and a woman sit in what appears to be a gondola. They are facing each other and are far away from the viewer. The lake that they are on glitters in the evening light of the setting sun behind them, and the deep blue and purple sky fills the rest of the image."" Add as much detail as you feel is necessary.

---

**4chan &amp; Pictures of Text**
---

* When writing the Username and Timestamp headers in 4chan threads, only include the Username and day of the year if either changes.
* Standard 4chan header formatting (Military time is used, i.e. 4:20:00 PM is written as 16:20:00): **UsernameMcAnon**, 4/20/2017, 04:20:03
* Feel free to make spelling and grammar corrections if you truly believe that it will not significantly change the heart of the content, but include a disclaimer if you do.
* Regarding 4chan or other threads, it is always to the benefit of both the transcriber and the reader to find the original thread. Always try to find and include a link to it if possible.
* If there is quoted greentext like this:

&gt; be me, lvl 3 cleric 

&gt;surrounded by mind flayers

* ...then make the &gt; sections each a full paragraph break apart. Like so:

\&gt; be me, the Vice Head Transcriber  
{blank line}  
\&gt; writin' formatting advice all day long

**Note:**

Most of the 4chan greentexts are already archived online in their original state. A large percent of the time you can find the original post by going to Google and putting in one sentence from the greentext image inside double quotes; this will make Google search for the exact sentence. The more unique the sentence, the better luck you'll have in finding the original post. Then you can just copy / paste / format and it will go much quicker!


---

**Comics**
---

* Please ensure that any text in the picture is transcribed verbatim rather than just being paraphrased.
* Write the text and describe the scene in the rough order that it is intended to be seen. For example, if there is text at the top of the panel, then a scene in the center, then more text at the bottom of the panel, perhaps a punchline, write it like:

**Panel 1**

**Person:** This is a sentence that is going somewhere funny!

*(Description of the scene)*

**Person:** This is the punchline!

* In short, transcribe the picture so that the heart of the joke remains the same, and so the transcription would be as funny to read as the image of the comic.

It is quite interesting as they follow a policy of hyper Pacifism (kill nothing at all, in some sects this means you wouldn't be able to eat say potatoes as you would be killing it). As they are part of the Dharmic religion group they also have the same general philosophy as Hindus and Buddhist where the ultimate goal of life is to get out of the cycle of re-incarnation.

The religion is quite small with only about 4 million adherents. 

Recently I have been studding Zoroastrianism but it is hard to do with so few resources on the religion in English, all you can find are a few translations of the Zend Avesta but that is about it. Unfortunately this religion is a dying one and might not be around in a few generations as many are somewhat hostile to the idea of converts.",nan

Then somehow on the conversation I was having with him in his office hours, I brought up one of the kits I had on backlog and his face lit up. He pulled out his phone and showed me his recent RG Destiny Gundam. It wasn't even just him though, he then swiped through and showed me his kids' SD builds also and how they recently started getting into Gunpla too.

7506,2017,5,dgysovr,nan,AskHistorians,1494514880,0,0,0,"Hey!  

The technological innovation I wanted to highlight is paper, as it definitely makes the jobs of historians much easier when you can have a rather long-lasting written account of events!  

After being invented in China in the late 1st century CE (although some claim it may have been invented earlier), paper gradually spread through the travels of Buddhist monks and other merchants along the Silk Road.  For example, it reached Central Asia about 500 years after its invention and paper fragments with Chinese writing have been found as far west as the Caucuses by 800CE (even if it was never fully adopted in that area). Notably however, paper didn't get adopted in India despite the penetration of the Silk Road into it, so this diffusion wasn't equal.

Relating a bit more specifically to my area, the story is that Muslims discovered paper after capturing Chinese papermakers following the Battle of Talas in 751 CE in Transoxania (modern day Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan area) .  This story is probably a bit apocryphal  and it is much more likely that paper-making had already been established in Central Asia after having spread from China earlier along the Silk Road, as evidenced by Central Asia having its own paper styles and manufacturing techniques.  

Talas itself was at a crossroads on the Silk Road.  Being a hub first allowed for paper to spread into the Central Asian region, as well as giving a large economic incentive to the Abassid Caliphate to capture the city.  So even though one could argue paper was introduced to the Muslim world through the conquest of Talas as opposed to Silk Road trade itself, one can say that the Silk Road definitely contributed to Muslim interest in the city in the first place, allowing for paper to be discovered and spread further west!",nan

Because of the material you cant really have the crazy mode textures of those, so they focus on slow undulations and changes in tightness. Additionally, the material has a bit more resistance to it. My Janine is pretty phenomenal. The actual entrance is not too unlike a humans (minus the scales), from the side and back it looks just like any other sleeve (albeit a bit heavy duty). Internally it has a wonderful feeling, the entrance is just tight enough  for you to be slow on entrance, then it opens out a little then tightens back up, with wavey texture the whole way along. Or it can be used the 'wrong' way around for a far tighter (too much for me, but some like that kind of thing) and more textured experience. The colour is amazing (I got mine in a custom blue/metallic brassey/bronzey colour that looks amazing). You can also insert normally and plug the end (with a finger for instance) to create varying (up to insane sleeve collapsing) suction. 

I dont have experience with the other toys but as far as I know the Janine is right in the middle of tightness and texture and feels the most similar to vaginal penetration (well, as far as a lump of silicone can). Only downside is the lube, you do need to use good lube with it, I use a hybrid silicone (sliquid silk) for the extra longevity and its great, but thin cheap pure water based things dont work so well (unless you want to reapply mid session). Cleaning is super simple (rinse through with very hot water, clean the gunk out and leave to dry). Drying does take quite a long time, but it's not any worse than a fleshlight. ",nan

One that's significant for me is [The Great Eastern](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJayDFdzHC26DT47x8M3TfBG1cXlggo6k) by The Delgados. It's quietly one of my favourites of all time. I listened to this a great deal in a period of my life that, retrospectively, felt like a kind of mania that was the precursor to a serious (to me) breakdown. Once that passed it took a good few years before I could hear it again without anxiety, but the fact that I can, and do from time to time, is a reminder how far I've bounced back.

One I still can't listen to is Mistabishi's *Drop*. That one I'd had on loop during one night that caused me a lot of upset for a long time, and I haven't dared try listen to [From Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IWlF-Vx7cE) in particular, since it would reduce me to tears in an instant ever after.",nan

Because of the variance of spells there is really no ""pro color"" choice and instead it is looking like you are looking to hit 1 of each color before turn 3. That is the most important thing in this deck because you have no double of the same color spells. The best way to assure one of each color by turn 3 is to have 12 of each source in your deck untapped.

Currently I am looking at:

12.5 Blue / 10.5 Black / 8.5 Plains.

Your priorities are straight, but if you want to be able to cast all of your spells basically from turn 3 on then you will need to slightly increase your black and white mana in the deck.

2 more Flooded strands and perhaps one more dual would be correct, but honestly you are very close as it is. Basically if you can sacrifice 1 blue source for a White/Black source that is untapped that would probably be your biggest gain overall.

The person throwing the shower (who, according to strict etiquette, shouldn't be your parents, thus leaving out the potential awkwardness of your mother not inviting his mother) gets to invite whomever she wants, and she is not required to invite more people.  Suppose she had planned a surprise shower for your side.  She might not have been able to find contact information for your MIL.

You and your husband should send her something in writing saying they hat you do not want her to post anything about your future children online ever.  Not pictures, not names, not birth date, not weight and length, not that she's so happy to be a grandmother now that baby has arrived, not that she's super thrilled to have visited baby, nothing.  Go on to say that unless she has confirmation from you otherwise in writing, this does not ever change.  (You may want to exempt texting too, so he never says okay to some long text and she claims  that he was saying okay to posting something.  In fact, you should probably say that you must explicitly and specifically say that that particular thing is acceptable.)


You say that you have a close, loving family.  I'll bet that you have an idea in your head of what a grandmother is.  I'll be that one or both or all of your grandmothers was/were that amazing image that you have.  This woman is not that.  Not everyone is a wonderful grandmother.  There was a post recently about a woman who pinched the baby to make it stay awake.  She's not the grandmother you fantasize about either.  If you want your fantasy, you'll have to look to your family to fulfill that.

You already find this woman terrible to deal with, and you sound like you want to raise your child to think that she's great.  I'm not saying that you have to have no contact with her, but you've already said that your husband can't tell her no.  That speaks to her being manipulative at the very least.  You don't want your child to think that's okay or normal.  You don't want your child to grow up suffering that treatment the way your husband did.

Just because she's not the grandmother of your fantasies doesn't mean she can't be a, supervised and with carefully chosen activities, grandmother.  If you want the relationship to be a positive for your child (if that's possible, which isn't guaranteed) it sounds like short, infrequent visits with some other activity going on will be the thing to do.  We'd love to see you!  Let's meet at the park for an hour before nap time.  Of course we can get together!  Let's meet at child-friendly place with a play area for lunch.",nan

Judging from the way everyone used ""Thaims"" Street (rhymes with ""Aims"") as a reference when giving directions it must have been well known but buggered if I could find it.

Eventually I asked someone where the hell this street was.  He just looked at me oddly and glanced up at the nearest street sign.  It said ""Thames Street"".

For those who don't know, the most well-known Thames is the river that runs through London, England.  It's actually pronounced ""Tems"".  Until I encountered the good folks of Newport I thought all English-speakers in the world used that pronunciation.

EDIT: When I told the Aussie guy I was with about the weird pronunciation he laughed and wondered what the locals would make of ""Edinburgh"".  Coincidentally, a day later we heard a couple of locals talking about Scotland.  They pronounced it ""eed-en-burg"" (first syllable with a long ""ee"") rather than the proper ""ed-in-bu-ra"" (first syllable with a short ""e"" like Mr Ed, and the ""burgh"" split into two syllables).",nan

I'm a reader, and have been my entire life, but can say with a great deal of confidence that if I'd only been exposed to novels through school I'd have never taken up reading with the passion I have for it now. Most of the reading I was ever *assigned* to do was some drek with a heavy-handed obvious **MESSAGE TO THE CHILDREN** that I'd either figured out three sentences in (if not from the title itself), or simply ignored. 

I firmly believe that young men will lap up literature that's handed to them, as long as it's not either (a) utter shit or (b) boring. I can bring up an anecdote to reinforce this position somewhat. A few years ago I was a member of the Canadian Army Reserves, instructing a basic training course. The overwhelming majority of my students were males around 17 or 18 years old (essentially, nearing high school graduation). Towards the end of training we had a couple range days for their final confirmation shoots. As NCO for the ammo &amp; working parties I had to designate a few sentries in shifts, essentially someone to sit at the range gate raising the gate for any visitors (of which there would be none) and trying not to fall asleep in a little shack. Generally, you'd never find a volunteer for that job as they'd rather be handling ammunition &amp; loading magazines because bullets are shiny and they'd rather do that. I'd brought my copy of Heinlein's *Starship Troopers* to the range that day as I figured I might be bored myself in the downtime. I handed it off to the first Private heading out to that dingy little shack to try and keep him awake, with the instructions to pass it on to the next soldier that went there and to make sure I got that book back at the end of the second day. 

Little bastards were practically queuing up to volunteer for the job after that. Long story short: yeah, high school males will read enthusiastically *if* they're given something they like. ",nan

A little while later, I flashed the same area where they had been standing, and instead of the golden figures, I saw, in the same shape as the figures, a gray area similar to that of the ""shadow"" figures that I had been seeing.  My current theory is that I'm actually seeing remnants or finger prints left over from entities.  That being said, I have seen some pretty dark, misty figures that don't stick around for long, like one time I was followed around by a particularly dark entity for about a month, but I wasn't too concerned about it because at the same time, along with the silver entity, there was a golden entity following me around at the exact same time as it.  During one experience when I was trying to flash the three entities while I was at my computer, I couldn't see anything, which I found odd because in nearly every flash during that month every day I had seen all three of them somewhere around me, even in my room.  However, during this one instance something was odd, so I stood up (it is sometimes easier for me to get a good flash when I'm standing up and not looking at anything in particular) and flashed.  I saw that where I had been previously sitting there was the dark figure standing, and on the opposite side of me there was the golden and silver entity.  I guess my flash was being blocked by the shadow figure, but I'm not a hundred percent sure so my other theory is that the silver entity was purposefully blocking my flash to keep me out of trouble.  My reaction to finding these three entities in my room and the particularly dark one being where I previously was sitting was to confront the dark entity because I was kind of sick of it following me around all the time and generally creeping me out.  So, I decided to confront it.  I told it to leave and flashed to see if it had left.  It didn't, so, while being really freaked out at that point, I asked the golden and silver entities if they could help me get it to leave my room.  I told it leave again and stood there for another 10 minutes before I did a flash again.  Didn't see anything: no dark entity, no silver, and no gold.  I moved into a different room and flashed again: still nothing.  Moved back towards computer: still nothing.  Tried again the next day and just saw the silver entity and the occasional remnant (that is what I'm assuming they are right now since it seems most of them don't even acknowledge me).  Every so often after that the golden one would visit me, and the dark entities were pretty rare for me to see, but don't stick around it seems.",nan

You need the Duration and effeciency mods to sustain renewal, you could make some soft changes there but when you play with a team it can get super expensive.

You could exchange (p) Vigor for Steel Fiber wich is a bit stronger, but the moment you aktivate Iron Renewal (p) Vigor is better because the bonus armor scales better with the higher HP pool.

Or you could use Health Conversion wich is mathmaticly the best option as long you have atleast **one** stack, wich is theoraticly possible but in the end you're not really able to kill the enemies at higher level with his Reckoning.

Since you're asking for highest EHP i assume you just wanna survive much and to survive much you should utelize his abilities. He has suprsingly much CC, his smite knock downs and procs [Puncture](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_2.0/Puncture_Damage) reliable, Hollowed ground protects you from Procs -looking at slahs- and keep in mind any form of CC is coded as Status - additonaly it protecs you from Energy drain auras, Reckoning knocks enemies down and hte Blind even if its short is super effective when you primarily use melee weapons. This all can increase your survivebility immensely, this is why you should use rage and here the high efficiency helps too because you can spam without thinking too much of your energy pool.

What i wanna say is that just focusing on getting the highest possible EHP isn't that good. He has suprisingly much utility and can proc status almost as good as Saryn who is recommended when you wanna use weapons with conditoin overload + oberon has the blind and a bit more health regen and armor.

This is maby not what you're looking for but this build is pretty solid just adjust it until you like it. There're more than enough posts/videos wich showcase some oberon builds, just get some inspiration and start modding.",nan

Federation:

The Genesis of Human Interstellar Civilization who formed as a pseudo United Nations to protect interests abroad from Sol. Unfortunately, they're a mega corporation in my eyes and seem to fit the 'Mericun Freedom stereotype far to well sometimes. I left them after I earned my permit to access our homeland. 

Empire:

I really, really, REALLY, *REALLY* don't like them. I don't like their ships, I don't like their political leanings, even their history is based on Genocide and warring with Walmar- I mean Tesc- I mean the Federation. They began as a colonial interest who tried to escape the grasp of the Feds if I recall correctly. I like their indentured servitude policy but I just can't stand all these dirty basking Imperial scum who think their glorified Iphone with a Frame shift drive duct taped to it is any better than my good old fashioned Ferdie. I do like the monarchy though, if only they didn't have any power and were just a ceremonial figure like the Old Earth Queen Elizabeth the II of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Alliance:

Ah, now these are the guys I can get behind. They began from the ashes of a war between the Federation and the Imperials IIRC. Now they're a beacon of neutrality against the Grand Star War of Walmart and North Korea. I honestly wish they had a proper standing Navy. I remember oogling over some fan art of what an Alliance Capital Ship could look like and I wish they were an actual superpower rather than the modern day equivalent of the European Union (In some respects, even the EU might be a bit stronger than the Alliance)

Pirates:

You know, if you're a gentleman or lady Pirate who makes his demands first before he shoots me as I'm high waking the fuck out of there, you're alright by my book :) I'll give you some cargo if I can't blast your fucking brains out, you definitely deserve it for making these conflicts a lot smoother!

Thargoids:

404: Not found

Edit: I should also mention, the majority of Humanity in Elite lives in a very abject poverty! From what I've noticed, we're incredibly rich and lucky to be able to fly around the bubble doing the things we do! I like to think that all of us are actually just moisture farmers from Tatooine who made enough money from Grandpappy's will that we can now afford a Sidewinder and can try to escape. We are way to powerful to be commoners, we can single handedly alter the economies of entire star systems, we can plunge places into war, we can single handedly starve people to famine by not delivering those landmines in the name of freedom.",nan

that is your problem. Wanting to quit without wanting to stop the feeling benzos give you. You need to start taking less but at a very slow rate. Some of my old pals use to be hooked on benzos bad. Like 10mg of Xanax a day and 20-30mg of etiz a day. Went to the doctor and told them what they were doing and they need help. Doc gave them anti-seizure medicine. I don't think the doc will give you any kind of weaker benzos bc they already know you are addicted and will most likely abuse.

Look up ""Benzo Taper Guides"" and find one that fits your needs. Take it slow. I think the recommended taoer is to cut back like .5mg every week or so but I'm no doctor.

Literally nobody is pretending homophobia is extinct. They may insinuate we should be better than that, but that is not the same thing. The fact footy is traditionally a boys' club and not easily overturned, is something well understood, hence the league's focus on women's involvement, broader community involvement, and the general talk of homosexuality etc.

So if everyone understands the problem, and he isn't offering a solution, then that raises the obvious question; why speak on this in the first place? Well we all know he loves the sound of his own voice, so that's a good starting point in answering that question.",nan

When I said I've never had a request for a male, this actually isn't true - I HAVE had a request but you see, it's all in FANTASY. Once I have arranged for the male, they chicken out. This has happened 100% of the time. Every single one has backed out. 

As far as women paying for a male dom, it's sort of like male prostitution. There's just a million guys to meet who can do this. A lot of super talented guys who are older. 

Where you come in is some rich guys stud or bull (as mentioned above) to fuck his wife in front of him. I would personally use your service for my own fun in my personal life but at the same time, I happen to know many handfuls of more qualified men who will do it for free and not put me or my partner at risk.

It takes MANY years to be a good dom and navigate the emotional realm that comes with this type of play. You have to protect yourself emotionally as well. It WILL change you if you're not very emotionally grounded.

Elemental Ward gives a lot of bonus armour (to everyone not super squishy), which makes him a seriously hard to kill frame, and reflects damage while also occasionally chilling targets.  This is so great for his survivability.  With Oberon's ability to grant base armour to others indefinitely now, this elemental ward bonus to others can make squishy frames into bruisers.

Vexing Armour is the main reason I play him.  It *only affects him*, but it's his Determinator skill.  It makes his armour reach *ridiculous* heights, allowing you to shrug off even juggernaut attacks (if you can get a heal.  Lookin' at you Oberon rework).  Meanwhile if your shields do drop, or even if you take toxic damage from various infested sources, you gain bonus damage very quickly and can thin out mobs super fast with even lackluster weapons.

I like his turret pelt/Effigy as well.  In all but the highest of high level content it does a considerable amount of damage, disrupts enemies with its roars, and does a decent job of area control/denial.

&gt; Emmanuel Macron&amp;#039;s lead over Marine Le Pen has slipped six points since polls conducted just before the first round last Sunday.

&gt; However he is still as much as 20 points ahead. According to pollster Harris Interactive, who correctly predicted the result of the first round with remarkable accuracy, Mr Macron now has a lead of 61% against Ms Le Pen&amp;#039;s 39%. :: Marine Le Pen: Who is National Front candidate in France election?

&gt; In the first round of voting last Sunday, Mr Macron secured 23.75% of the vote compared to Ms Le Pen&amp;#039;s 21.53%. Given that half of voters didn&amp;#039;t choose either Ms Le Pen or Mr Macron, big question in this final week is which way will they all vote? Polling has revealed some surprising trends.

&gt; Do you think it is worthwhile for a language to have an unambiguous grammar?

Personally, for my current language project, I've chosen to use a context-free grammar that is unambiguous and can be parsed with an LL(1) (predictive) parser. I like it because it's so easy to specify and implement and because it's beginner-friendly.

I also learned from Wirth's writing (hence, minimalism) and grew up with Scheme (so prefix syntax feels natural to me).

8107,2016,2,czj5war,nan,OutOfTheLoop,1458209150,0,3,0,"TL;DW:

1. Due to the way the physics of the game work, the game wants to move Mario, but it wants him to stay out of the ceiling more, so he doesn't move.

2. Also due to the physics of the game, being in water and on a slope at the same time causes your speed to build up. There is no upper limit on this because the games expects you to slip back into the water seconds after this process begins. 

3. By combining these facts, in certain places, any speed is possible, though it takes a while to build up to it.

4. When Mario goes to move, the game checks where his next position will be, given his speed and direction. If the next  position is inside a wall, it stops him. If the next position would be far enough, Mario can go through the wall, allowing him to, in effect, teleport.

5. The way the game handles collisions creates a sort of 'loop'. For example, imagine a chessboard. Call the bottom left square 'a1'. The squares bordering a1 are a2 above it, b2 diagonal from it, and b1 to the right of it. Now imagine a King piece moving along that bottom row. It moves from a1 to b1, then to c1, and so on until it reaches h1. Now there's no more board, so what happens if it moved to the right again? In Mario 64 physics, the collision detection loops back around to the other side, in this case back to square a1. Because there's a board to support the king at square a1, the king hovers in the air just to the right of the board. In the game, what this means is that if you go a certain distance away from any point in a level, the game will react as though you landed int he same place yo started because the collision detection loops.

6. Because this collision detection keeps looping, and due to a few quirks in the way things are calculated, it's easier to plan your movements in distances of 4x[the distance discussed in 5]. To use the chessboard analogy, it's like moving 32 squares at a time instead of just 8.

7. You don't however, have to go to exactly the same spot you left. You can jump to different parts of the level by carefully modulating your speed. Thus, this type of run plans out routes, using various slopes in the level to allow Mario's speed to drop while still maintaining the circumstances that allow him to launch. By launching int he right direction with the right speed, it's possible to keep looping the collision detection around so that Mario ends up right at the star's position without having to actually jump.

EDIT:

8. Going up a slope requires more speed than going along a flat plane. De facto speed refers tot he amount of speed you actually need to have once you've factored in the relative heights of your start and end points.",nan

Most pesticides are derived from oil, without it a single outbreak of disease or pest would destroy the harvest. You can resort to alternative copper and sulfur based pesticide, but you need to use ten times as much with them - and you'll need to carry them to the farm with a crippled transportation system. Than there's the mining and manufacturing operation for the copper and sulfur, another stranglehold once crude dries up. It adds up once you include other things.  

And you're forgetting that synthetic fertilizers allow one crucial thing: the constant replenishment of soil nutrient. Without that that, farm land quickly becomes depleted in fertility within a few years. Before, farmers would use crop rotation to replenish the soil, leaving a quarter of the land to fallow unplanted. Taken in extreme, that's 25% of your yield gone right there. Corn/soybean rotation is practiced today, but these farmers still depend on fertilizers to replenish the soil. Yes, you can use manure, but people have been using manure, both human and animal, for millennia. Not to mention, the livestock producing the manure depend on the same fertilizer-intensive crops for their feed. America's huge cattle population would be curbed massively, along with the manure supply.

There was a passage in Max Brook's ""Word War Z"" where it outlines that after the collapse of the global economy, all the parks and sport fields in large cities had to be converted into community gardens in order to supplement the reduced food supply. I think a lot of that would be going on in places like the US or Europe, seeing how most of what we refer to as our suburbia covers up what use to be prime farmland before the advent of the automobile and cheap gas made far-flung suburbs a feasible reality.

 As for beam weapons I like not having them since I am not a fan of beams in scifi in general. Projectiles and melee weapons just seam cooler to me. And the main Gundam, Barbatos, has an awesome melee weapon.

I would respond to this:

&gt; The belief in 3. without invalidating 1. and 2. is what prevents me from being an MRA; they fundamentally deny 1. And/or 2.

By saying that this is *your subjective belief* about the actions and beliefs of MRAs.

The difference between us is that I feel you're perfectly within your philosophical rights to reject that label. If, on the whole, you feel that the ideology or members of that group are incompatible with your worldview in whole or in part, I'll respect your wishes to distance yourself from the label.

Of the 4 cars involved, I was the only one with ANY insurance. The guy that caused it was drunk, so his insurance was null and void. The car he first hit was a grey import skyline. The owner of which was on his way home from getting it from the importers, and *had not yet gotten insurance*.

Exactly.  If you want a service that is well known for being a tipping service and you act like a rich entitled douche even a little and you don't tip, you can add ignorant to the list of things.  Often people I notice who don't tip are the ones on the company dime.  They ask for valet service, because the company is paying for their parking so the extra cost doesn't matter to them.  They then proceed to not tip because they can't charge it to the company...if you don't want to tip, park yourself like everyone else.    

Additionally, people I know who worked as bellmen have had to charge certain groups that would show up, a fee for using baggage carts (normally a free service provided with a bellman to load, move and unload bags but a tip is appreciated). The people would act like rich douches occupying 45 minutes of a bellman's time asking for everything they could AND then wouldn't tip after all of that.  So basically acting like super important, demanding VIP's but don't have the basic idea in your head that if you are rich and some big shot who gets a bunch of people to do your bidding when you travel, you damn well better tip, means you aren't that rich and aren't a VIP.",nan

There are two keys:
1. Controlling the distance
2. Well-timed counters

1- If Punk gets in on you, he will put constant pressure on you and you will eventually get caught. Many think that blocking will stop that. But his pressure is so overwhelming from many angles that it's only a matter of time till he opens you up. To counter this you have to control the distance. If you have a character who can zone (fireballs, long-range attacks), you need to use it to your advantage heavily. Don't think you can compete with him toe to toe. Zone, zone and zone hardcore. This was Du's mistake vs Punk. He kept going in on Punk thinking he can out-bully him. Nope.

2- What if you don't have a character who is strong at zoning? If this is the case, you need to be strong at countering his jabs and footsies. When you're blocking his combos there will be breaks and pauses in between each punch in a combo string. You need to time your jab to interrupt his combo string. Once you interrupt his string with your jab you can counter him with a combo of your own and pressure him. This is what Haitani did to get those 3 wins on Punk in the finals. 

Of course, all of this is easier said than done, but it's not impossible. Not anyone can beat punk. You have to the type of player to train hard and you need to train the right things.",nan

Power almost always corrupt and China only recently has started cracking down on corruption. I'm just explaining the situation and why China is the way it is.

You must understand that independent thought is great, but not when your country is in a crisis. It's analogous to Dota. You need a captain who's telling everyone what to do and they need to listen. It's why pub games are so hard to win since chances are you have five different players with five different ideas on how they should be playing.


Anyways I don't want to get into a whole thing. It's just that guy seems to think living in China is like North Korea or Nazi Germany when realistically living in the city feels pretty much like living anywhere else. You have food, water, shelter, electricity, and internet. If you're a westerner (or interested in such things) you can use proxies to access things like Facebook or Twitter.

* Aquinas seems to be drive home on the point that God is infinite a la His lack of body/form/matter and state of action.
* I hope he revisits the issue of evil, because it really is only mentioned in passing and probably diserves it's own article, if not question, not just a passing objection.
* I really like how Aquinas interprets Gn 1:26 in light of God being body-less-ness.
      
     &gt;Reply to Objection 2: Man is said to be after the image of God, not as  regards his body, but as regards that whereby he excels other animals.  Hence, when it is said, ""Let us make man to our image and likeness"", it  is added, ""And let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea"" (Gn.  1:26). Now man excels all animals by his reason and intelligence; hence  it is according to his intelligence and reason, which are incorporeal,  that man is said to be according to the image of God.

I guess what it'll come down to is just being a bit more personally safe. Giving out flight and gate information is beyond board and in future he and others should just keep anything that major in the complete dark, don't even stream in the airport, it's just not worth it.

As for people calling stores, I think it would make sense for streamers to let the stores know ahead of it happening that people can and will call in. Most people are cool and understanding in life, maybe make it out to the owner as free advertising or something. Some people will be down and some won't.

Are you so scared of backlash or anything countering your points? there is a difference between being cocky and being a downright ass, saying I'm the best player in the world is cocky, calling people easy or garbage is beyond cocky, calling out an entire country unprovoked is actually just racist. I haven't seen any chinese fans saying fuck you to any of eg's members outside sumail yet and interestingly sumail is its newest member, care to explain why is that? They are flaming sumail because sumail provoked them, don't turn this shit around on them. If ppd started calling everybody shit you'd think people won't flame the hell out of him?

and since when is the western fanbase the embodiment of virtual and good sportsmanship? where the fuck were you when ixmike was getting flamed every day? or when tc was called trash carry? or literally anything involving xvost and many of it went way beyond memes. Not to mention all the racist shit that has happened over the years, yeah people here are really respectful towards peruvian players arent they? giving posts saying we should wipe out peruvians hundreds of upvotes sure is funny right?

I wanna be Superman, and explore the Superman mythos in a video game. I wanna play as Wonder Woman and fight mythological gods and monsters. I wanna play as Green Lantern and be a space cop. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so, because all people want is Batman, and that's all we're ever gonna get. It just sucks man. We shouldn't stop getting Batman, but we shouldn't ONLY get Batman either. This rich and exciting universe with all kinds of great heroes, villains, weirdos and settings will remain untapped in the video game world. For now all I have is Injustice 2, which I'm sure will be good, but I'll die happy if I ever get to play a great Superman game.

8534,2016,2,czj9vgc,nan,GGdiscussion,1458211024,0,2,0,"WOW that is a lengthy academic paper, but in the interests of responding tonight and not next week, I'll go over your summation of the test (and also, you need () to make a hyperlink on reddit, not {}).

I'm gonna quibble a lot on the wording of this test, because it says a lot of things like ""Women do [X thing]"", many of those things being falling into common self-serving biases, which will generate false positives from respondents who believe PEOPLE do those things, or that left-wing culture is TEACHING women to do those things (and everyone learns from their culture, good and bad), rather than it being their inherent nature.

And while it should be common sense to presume that's not what the test MEANS, the fact that they say ""most women"" for a FEW of the questions, confuses the intent, and could lead a person to believe that thinking ANY women do the things they don't specify require MOST women, is misogynistic thinking.

I also have a serious problem with the two questions that substitute ""women"" with ""feminists"", having a negative opinion of the feminist movement is NOT the same thing as misogyny, because feminism doesn't speak for all, or even most women.  What is the current stat, 17% of women identify as feminists?

Presuming the rephrasing of these questions to presume they all are asking one's opinion of men and women in general, as essential identities (ewww, gender essentialism...), discounting the inherent flaws of human nature, and removing mentions of feminism, my answers would be as follows:



    Women exaggerate problems at work

No

    Women are too easily offended

no

    Most women interpret innocent remarks as sexist

no

    When women lose fairly, they claim discrimination

no

    Women seek special favors under guise of equality

no

    Women make unreasonable demands

No

    Women are seeking more power than men

No

    Women seek power by gaining control over men

Yes

    Most women tease men sexually

Yes

    Once a man commits, she puts him on a tight leash

No

    Women fail to appreciate all men do for them

No

    A good woman should be set on a pedestal

No

    Women should be cherished and protected by men

Yes

    Men should sacrifice to provide for women

Within reason

    In a disaster, women need to be rescued first

No

    Women have a superior moral sensibility

No

    Women have a quality of purity few men possess

No

    Women have a more refined sense of culture, taste

No

    Every man ought to have a woman he adores

Every straight man?  Well in an ideal world EVERYONE would find true love, but I recognize it's unrealistic to expect.

    Men are not complete without women

No

    Despite accomplishment, men are incomplete without women

No, and redundant

    People are often unhappy without heterosexual romance

OFTEN?  Absolutely.  ALWAYS?  No.

So how sexist does that make me according to their rules?

As for how GG or SJWs might answer the question, I really have no way of answering on behalf of such broad groups, you'd have to poll people, and even then many would probably say what they think you want to hear.",nan

I don't think it's inherent to either side, but nationalism or religious fanaticism can be very motivating when there's a hot, existential war going on. Moderate reasonable people don't make the best soldiers. Fighting for God though, that's good motivation.

You cannot make that assumption. A huge procentage of ISIS members are foreigners and not syrians, all because of a proxy war that is only making matter worse for the syrian people. There is a reason why they were moderate in the beginning, because they were syrians and not psycho imported there to create choas and lay waste to the syrian societies.

As for the situation in Palestine, it has never been about religion but always about freedom. This is why religious persecution in Palestine is low in comparisson to other countries. There are still problems but I believe we palestinians will able to tackle them rather nicely in the end and will not turn to as ""evil extremist taliban-inspired, alqueda-trained, isis-loving, and hitler-worshipping sharia-ruled islamist country"" as Bibi would like all to believe.",nan

The description, by the way, needs some cutting down. There's no reason to refer to the person as a subject, no reason for tons of footnotes, no reason for the collapsibles either. This needs a lot of cutting down because it's a fairly simple concept. The Wondertainment link also seems kind of pointless. It doesn't add to the narrative in many ways.

I would recommend cleaning this up, actually finishing the parts that are currently unfinished, and then putting it on the [forums](http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-50864/p/1). The subreddit is fine, but if you want critique from experienced SCP writers, the forums are the best place to go. It may take a bit to get a response, though. Actually, if you want you can send me a link to a forum post if/when you make it and I'll do a more in depth review and point out specific sentences and phrases that could be fixed.

I guarantee it's possible to select an action during an enemy attack animation and then have another enemy act BEFORE your action, at least in FFVI.

I'm not disagreeing that ATB games have different flow from static turn-based games.  However, static turn-based games like the early Final Fantasy or SaGa (a.k.a. Final Fantasy Legend) games have a different flow than static turn-based games like FFTactics and FFX, which in turn have a different flow from static turn-based games like Xenosaga or Chrono Cross.  In all of these cases, however, the actions during battle still occur in distinct turns instead of potentially happening at the same time.  ""Flow"" is not a good way to try to pin down what exactly you want the term ""turn-based"" to mean.

What that means is, after all of the people who washed of for medical, mental and physical shortcoming leave, the amount of people who are fit that get through is larger. That means if you have no medical problems, you don't have any metal in you and you can run a 9 on the luc ledger with 8 or so pull ups you have a good chance of getting to rouge. And, as I said, there is a higher percentage of applicants getting through rouge. 

About the ticket. First, you should buy a two way ticket, they usually cost only a small amount more than a one way. Make sure the return date is at least 30 days later. Second, Just plan out your route ahead of time, use Google maps. If you get lost, just walk up to a local, point to yourself and say ""Legion Entranger"" or ""Fort de Nogent?"" And they should point you in the right direction. Or you could get a plane ticket to Marseille, where Aubagne is just a short train ride away, and you won't have to traverse Paris. 

As for the criminal record, if it is truly destroyed and there is no way for them to find out about it then why would you tell them? If they do find out whithin 6 months of you signing your contract, however you may be kicked out. As long as you weren't selling drugs it won't disqualify you, but it would help if they didn't know. Use your descretion. 

Hope this helped, and Bonne Chance!",nan

&gt; During the Sad Wings sessions, Howells encouraged the band to work on a heavy metal cover of ""Diamonds &amp; Rust"" by folk singer Joan Baez, but it did not appear on the album. The band had a hit in the UK with a re-recording of the cover version the following year, after they had moved to CBS Records.

The ""Howells"" they refer to is Dave Howells, who (I believe), was the head of Gull Records at the time. Interesting how the band were essentially pressured to do the song in the first place, and yet it's become a concert staple. What I want to know is how Dave Howells came to think of Diamonds &amp; Rust as a cover. Seems like such an odd choice, especially coming from a record company executive.",nan

Finally, the title includes ""Muslim"" when none of the articles say anything about ""Muslim"" only that the man was from Surinam, which is less than 15% Muslim.  this is a far cry to assume that he is Muslim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Suriname).",nan

I believe this is your answer as long as permissions are set properly. 

First, I'm not sure if the advice I give here will work for a ""single user"" using a single account. Maybe try making two separate accounts and join the game as two separate players to test this out. 

I can tell you how to allow each player to see only what their assigned token can see with dynamic lighting. Here you go &amp; hope it helps...

**For things to work the way you want them to you can't allow players to control other player's tokens or character sheets.**

If you link each token to a character sheet it will solve your problem as long as each character sheet's permissions are assigned to each individual player.

You probably know some of this stuff, but here's a sort of walkthrough:

First, each player should only have permission to edit their own character sheet.

Second, assign each token to the appropriate character sheet. Double click each token and use the ""represents character"" drop down to choose which character sheet in the Journal each token represents.

When you have each token assigned and set up the way you want it, then link the token to the character sheet (select the token by clicking on it, open the character sheet it represents&gt;edit&gt;""default token"").

Essentially, this will prevent players who don't have permission to open a given character sheet from moving that sheet's token, or ""see"" from that token's point of view (as long as ""see light"" is unchecked in dynamic lighting settings).

I wrote this from memory as I don't currently have a paid subscription, so sorry if I got anything wrong. Hope this helps!

(note that if a player has a torch, say, then the other players should be allowed to see light from that torch. I usually leave ""see light"" on for these kind of tokens for this reason. Something like Darkvision is hard to simulate, but turning off ""see light"" and setting light for the appropriate range for that character works okay).",nan

Brian Setzer - Was incredibly talented on guitar, my brother jammed with him a lot, and that is about when my brother realized what real talent was, and decided to go to college and forget about being a guitar player in a rock band after realizing how much better Setzer was. Very nice guy, down to earth, and an incredible guitar player.

* Throw a storm at them from time to time. Sailing in rough seas can be dangerous, why should flying in rough skies be any different?

* Their supplies aren't infinite. They have to land somewhere to get them, and that's when you throw quests, ambushes, or general goings-on at them.

* Sometimes things have to be done in areas that can't be reached by airship. Dense forest, caves and other underground areas, any kind of hostile territory, etc. Even cities may have no-fly zones enforced. If the players can't see it from the sky, they may want to pound dirt to find it.

* Let's not forget simply adding aerial content, as well. Lots of flying things that want to eat people, and where there are ships, there will be pirates. Sky pirates are cliche, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less cool.

We usually imply the for-profit sector, but obviously that is not all there is in industry (or outside academia). And for some positions, the type of physics/research will matter, but I was responding about jobs that are agnostic about that, first because I'm obviously not qualified to speak on that, and second because this is generalist advice that isn't meant to be about jobs that are looking for a specific type of research. The second point brings up another key assumption, that the ""industry"" job requires you to transfer your skills, and is not necessarily looking for people with your research and physics type background.

Are you saying consulting isn't as plentiful as it used to be? I haven't heard anything about them slowing down, and if anything more of the firms that didn't hire PhDs are seeing applications from people with (any kind of) PhDs and snapping them up.

I've heard the ""PhD is a turn off"" argument many times before, beyond just the field of physics. And I've always noticed that a PhD is detrimental in a position that is not challenging, not rewarding, and usually below the level that a person with a PhD would be qualified for and interested in. I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but I think it hurts everyone when people either leave their PhD off their resume in fear of that (so what are they going to say they have been doing all that time?), or when they apply for jobs that they won't like, and that the employer knows they won't like, because that's not fooling anyone.

So of course a PhD can be detrimental, anything ""can"" be a bad fit, following the same logic. However, it is the responsibility of the job seeker, in my opinion, to apply to jobs that make sense for them, and to tailor their application to the position and to the business world. I've seen much more of the latter as a barrier to non-academic employment than the mythical ""im overqualified, therefore the PhD is detrimental"" situation.

It's great to want to relax, but what you want in the short term may not fit well in the long term, and perhaps the employer/hiring manager knows that and/or has seen that before. I know many PhDs in jobs with no increased responsibility/title/pay and they might have liked the mindless relaxing at the start, but let's face it, they're ambitious and high achieving people, so the mindless job idea doesn't work for very long.

I see what you're saying, but I don't think it's possible to make no assumptions. I should state them, I agree with you, and I apologize for not putting all that in a comment I made on mobile, given that I thought it would be understood for what it is; generalist advice with some physics examples.

If you are saying physicists don't think they are qualified or require some specific degree/certification, why did you mention the data science fellowships? You don't need the fellowship if you're so confident in your abilities, right? Everyone else in the thread is also suggesting bootcamps and certifications, so I don't think that makes sense.

Are you sure that's the main reason for PhDs having trouble getting industry jobs? Because you've said it multiple times here, and I've heard it super often, but like I said, there are a lot of other reasons people don't get hired. Unless you're sure it's not poor interviewing skills, and inability to communicate how what you've done adds value and can have a positive business impact, and there is a lack of cultural/values fit between you and the company, then you could make a case that it's some negative assumption about physics PhDs. Or, if you had real data to show it, that would be convincing too : )",nan

Except he left the First Order for moral reasons, right? Pretty sure he didn't think that was the safe course of action... but then he didn't tell anyone about Starkiller base... and he lied to the rebellion (risking their attack plan, in fact) to rescue Rey. He does have some motivations towards her, but they feel very cliche to me.

You can make the case that it's no worse than Luke in ANH, and you might be right... I haven't really spend much time evaluating the OT as a story. It's sort of too much a part of my cultural upbringing for me to comment on it.

&gt; Rey goes from being curious about the outside world while tied to her home, to forced into accepting her power and understanding that she may be the only one capable of beating Kylo Ren (forced on her as she watches the only other alternative, Han, fail to save Kylo) and accepting her powers (although in sure we'll wrestle with that in TLJ quite a bit more, much like ESB Luke). Luke isn't accounted for, and is out of reach, so Rey is really the only one who can feasibly carry the day (though Luke ends up being an alternative in the end, during the denoument.

I mean, you can make that case, but her actions match those of an almost entirely passive/reactioary character... she never makes choices other than run from/escape from/fight people who are in front of her and hostile to her.

She also bugs me by having basically no flaws and being good at absolutely everything instantly. Mechanics, hand to hand combat, piloting, shooting, force powers, lightsaber combat... it feels like they really rushed that part of her development, and made her into a Mary Sue.

&gt; Han goes from scoundrel who knows he's meant to be doing something to help, to accepting his role in creating the current problems of the galaxy and dies to try to fix his mistakes (redemption, pretty easy to have closure this way). 

I disagree with that interpretation, but I actually do think Han had a satisfactory arc. I don't think he was particularly pushed to confront Kylo out of responsibility to the galaxy, because frankly, I think he went out there expecting (by his own judgement) to die... but he was choosing to trust Leia's judgement, as she'd pushed him to get their son back.

&gt; Poe is a static character, and the film never really tries to force him into the limelight as a main character. 

Except for kinda clumsily killing and resurrecting him, and making the opening sequence focused on him. I don't necessarily have a problem with him being a bland character, but to me all of the new characters are bland, so every missed opprotunity costs them.",nan

9035,2017,5,dgz0anf,nan,AskReddit,1494518563,0,0,0,"In this post, author, /u/ketryne presents a Suessian interpretation of the classic Stephen King novel ""The Shining.""  His key point is to demonstrate that the whimsical non-coherence of Dr. Suess aligns with the non-coherant insanity of ""The Shining's"" antagonist, Jack, as he embraces the darkness of the Overlook Hotel. In this way, /u/ketryne's post rejects the duality of man and how he chooses to accept the unpredictability of life and potential possession by demonic forces.  While one would assume a Suessian narrator would overcome such forces with colorful illustrations and zany rhymes it soon becomes apparent that this will not be the case.

In the first stanza the author very rationally sets the scene for the rest of the poem. The only exception is the term ""glook"" which hints at the Suessian journey the reader is about to embark on.  However, the lack of rhyme or meter sets the tone that something is slightly off with the narrator.

The second stanza continues to toy with the reader, implying that the unreliable narrator sees ""it."" The final line of the poem hits the reader like Chris Brown after a night of drinking, as the reader realizes that the narrator has been overtaken by the darkness.  This leads the reader to the poem's final conclusion, that there is nothing holding society together except a thin veil of sanity and that the only duality which man has is which insanity he will feed.",nan

The Monarchy of Canada is at the core of both Canada's federal structure and Westminster-style of parliamentary and constitutional democracy.

The Canadian sovereign is the personification of the Canadian state and is Canada as a matter of constitutional law. The current Canadian monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 6 February 1952.

Tankier fighters can freely kill battleships, even good ones. But frail fighters can be handled with proper battleship techniques, so it may take a lot longer to kill them... Fortunately, battleships this good are quite rare.

Standard overlord (0 reload) requires intense techniques and timing to kill, as well as very specific fighter builds depending on your killing method. Also assuming that the overlord doesn't normally leave himself open. Glass overlord (5 reload) cannot be killed easily if one is playing correctly.

Factory cannot be killed if they stay close to their drones.

Otherwise, drone tanks don't have too many advantages to use to actually kill fighters, aside from having drone speed be slightly faster than a 7/7 booster, but that only applies to users of the standard drones, some seers lack this advantage.",nan

[Indiana code in question.](http://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-35-criminal-law-and-procedure/in-code-sect-35-42-2-3.html)

Also I do believe it's been held in court before that the mere flipping of the bird alone is not provocation. A reasonable person seeing a stranger on the road giving them a finger (and nothing else) would not likely provoke a reasonable person to a physical altercation. Having ZERO interactions behind the action of flipping the bird, just flipping off random people, cannot possibly be provocation.

If they had a verbal spat before or a disagreement or something, possibly (and I think that's been upheld by IN courts).... but with ZERO interaction previous I would find it hard to believe the court would rise to support the claim.

Then again, this IS Indiana courts... the ones who said we are too dumb to know if we are being illegally detained or arrested therefore have no Right to self Defense if a cop does actually illegally arrest us.

Current status may say people are friendly and getting along, but the moment something entices players to hose another power, regardless of their Fed/Imp/Ind status, it'll happen.  Lasting permanent peace among rivals is more a matter of the limitations of the PP system, than the efforts of the factions coming to accord.  While diplomacy plays a role, the leaders of each power's factions are limited by how much control they reign over their followers.  Players pretty much follow orders when they feel like it and can ignore leaders with no repercussions.  This is a game where pvp is encouraged, don't expect me to treat it as if it isn't.

As it stands, the biggest threat to AD at the moment is 5C.  It's a leaky boat mechanic and everyone is stuck bailing or just letting it sink.  Despite all the talk, Kuki An is still sitting on our Expansion list.  It wasn't the efforts of one or two people either.  We watched the numbers as last week finished up and the logistical effort was enormous.  While we can't prove who did it (Thank you ED anonymity), we know they had to be a fairly large group.  Unaffiliated group?  Not likely.  Federation?  If so, why not brag?  So, then, who?  Nobody's given me a good answer yet.  All the posturing in the world won't change that and it doesn't seem that your touted diplomacy worked either.  Bluster and make veiled threats of ALD aggression all you want.  If a chunk of ALD wanted to go behind their leaders' backs and hose us, it'd happen, if it hasn't already.  There's not a thing you can do about it, not a thing I can do about it, and not a thing AA can do about it.  ",nan

&gt; prison he called home.

This seems abrupt. I would let us feel how this place is stifling, make it seem claustrophobic for the reader.

&gt;An apartment complex, what many would call it so long ago, it held quite a few rooms, and a number of strange fixtures that come standard nowadays. Talking appliances, kitchen assistants, even cleaners that are built into the place; it was all a lot to take in.

Again, you tell us what is in his apartment. Let us see it unfold naturally. Have the appliances speak to him, have him try to come up with the phrase they used to use to describe his living quarters.

&gt;He saw it again; the same beautiful lady that greeted him...

I feel like her description should come first. Most of your readers will know what modern humans look like, but will be more interested in what sets her apart.

Also, the line about reproduction is confusing and may need a bit of fiddling.

Also, all of Larah's dialog at the end seems a touch too unnatural. It reads as more programmed than her programmed language. I'd think the audience should be surprised by her authenticity when she reaches that fundamental truth that she is content - the opposite of what our poor time traveler is.

My personal diagnosis has been that West is not well-familiar with Eastern European folklore, and thus the first competent retelling of it to a Western audience made it look ... (no pun intended) ... magic.  To me who grew up on fairy tales about enchanted -  and not always in good ways - forests, Baba Yagas, and village girls who grew up to save their land, the subject matter of the book was about as familiar as an-elves-and-goblins tale to someone who grew up in Great Britain. 

I always thought that is was a good read, but award-winning? not really.  The book never made me cringe, or lose suspence of disbelief (unlike some other books I've read recently), nor did it bore me (unlike some other books I've been reading recently).  But nothing in this book stands out and above the classical Eastern European tale, with some Polish bureaucracy thrown in for good measure.  

There is a whole genre of Slavic fantasy (perpetuated often by writers with Slavic-centric, or nationalist views - regardless of the specific country of origin of the author: Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Serbia, etc...).  I am almost completely disinterested in it for various reasons (quality of writing being the primary concern, ideology of the authors being up there as well). Uprooted fits in that genre thematically really well, but probably stands tall as a much better-written book.  

(Obligatory obvious disclaimer: not all Eastern European fantasy writers write in this genre, so just saying ""Russian fantasy"" or ""Polish fantasy"" does not equate it to ""Slavic-centric fantasy"").",nan

The first began with the Homestead Act and ended in the first decades of the 20th Century as unclaimed land basically disappeared. The Dust Bowl (a man-made disaster, it should be noted), however, reversed the settlement pattern and drove huge numbers of farmers and ranchers out of the western states. In the aftermath of that, the federal government bought up vast tracts of abandoned farmland and created the modern national grasslands and public grazing system.

But, in the mid-20th century, two things happened that allowed people to move back into the rural west: Dam construction spread irrigation and electricity throughout the region, and rising energy prices in the 70s drove demand for oil and natural gas drilling. Farmers, ranchers, and oil workers came back to the Great Plains. But by the late 80s that trend had reversed, [and once again the west was losing population rapidly](http://www.lacusveris.com/The%20Hi-Line%20and%20the%20Yellowstone%20Trail/The%20Buffalo%20Commons/From%20Dust%20to%20Dust.shtml).

In the last decade, though, the natural gas boom has once again brought some population back to the region, but eventually we'll see the pattern return and the western states will lose population.

The reality is that most of the North American interior is just not suited to ranching or farming on this scale. It's an invitation for economic and environmental disaster, and each time the bottom falls out of the market we find ourselves with money and infrastructure invested in a region that cannot support the population we expected. It would likely be better for everyone except the large ranchers and farmers if we stopped subsidizing the endeavor and began returning most of the region to a more or less natural (or at least pre-colonization) state.",nan

Also, I was listening to music. Nothing particular, just something to keep my mind working too. Nothing particular, but kept me entertained, so entertained that I didn't see that lady running on the other way. When we shocked, her papers flew through the air, falling all over. I got up, helped her to get up, and repack all the papers.

[Girl's point of view] I was in hurry, didn't even notice there was people around me. But he didn't notice me too, so it's not entirely my fault. He got me up and helped me to repack all the papers, then I thanked him, and went on my way again. I was going to court, present the defense of my client. When I got there, I noticed, and opened the folder, I noticed: the main paper wasn't there. Everything, but the document with his alibi. And we had already delayed the court for 2 weeks.

[Defendant's point of view] If I was mad? Of course I was fucking mad!, I payed that incompetent piece of shit to help me, and she ""lost the paper"". There I was, unjustly on jail, for a crime I didn't commit. Being mad would help me? No, it could just corrupt me and lock me even more in hate. I started reading on the jail. Not only for me, but started reading stories for the other prisoners (they didn't know how to read, most of them), from Nietzsche and other philosophers, to Douglas Adams. We all had a good fun. When I got out, I started writing too, specially motivational and inspirational books.

[*Someone that reads the Defendant's book*'s point of view] His book isn't really the best book I've ever read, but it made me think about how everything works. It'd not just wait and watch everyone try and make the difference, you need to be the different in you, and in others too. After this, I started seeing my employees differently, not just as someones that I payed money to make things, but as people that had lives, and people that they care about, and things they want to do. I was old, money wouldn't serve me anymore.

[*Someone that got a raise from the reader*'s point of view] I didn't get why he gave this raise to me, but all I could do was thank him. Even if it wasn't big deal, it helped me and my brother get out of the lame, and start to retake our own lives. 3 years ago, my wife died, and I'm still waiting for the governmental insurance, that I'm sure will never come. This money will help me finish my house (and pay the debt to the bank), and help my brother with his sickness.

[Brother's point of view] That was a really odd illness. I didn't understand what it was, all I remember was the doctor saying ""Chronical"", ""Incurable"", ""Luckily treatable"", and my brother explaining me there was a chance, but it was very expensive, more money than we could possibly see in our lives. His boss, god bless him, gave him a generous raise, and after about 6 months saving money of the raise, he got to take me to Singapore.

[Doctor's point of view] Seeing that little boy, with such a terrific disease, and the will of his brother to save him from it, really touched me. It wasn't a rich man coming to me to treat a random common illness that he got when he traveled to Australia, it was a really act of bravery and love. He insisted to pay me for the surgery, but I couldn't accept it. I proposed him a deal: I take the money, if he helped me to start a campaign for awareness and support for this disease, to spread how it's terrible, and help people throughout the world.",nan

MORE THAN a century ago, Congress gave the president extraordinary powers to protect precious public lands, in part to enable the White House to quickly preserve the Southwest’s Anasazi ruins from looters. Since then, presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to create scores of national monuments on hundreds of millions of acres. But a president has never tried to undo a national monument, and it is 


For that matter, it is unclear whether President Trump will try to do so. But there are ominous signs that he is considering at least shrinking protected areas. In an 


In fact, recent presidents have used the Antiquities Act ambitiously , but, for the most part, not in unprecedented ways. From the start, presidents used the act to preserve huge tracts of land. Teddy Roosevelt 


The Antiquities Act 


Mr. Obama 


There is much good in the Antiquities Act track record, because presidents, in their broad view of the national interest, have generally used their powers judiciously. Moreover, Congress has not been absent from this process. Very often it has ratified presidential actions, and at times it has checked the president’s use of the act, an interaction that restrains presidential abuse. Mr. Trump should keep this broad national interest, and long view, in mind.

**数分置きに、こんな状況です**

**from myoou**

いいえ、あなたが統失の被害妄想を根拠に間違いを言いふらすのは黙ってみていられる状況ではありません

ぼくはtokoro10さんではありません

あなたは統失です

この2点を認めないかぎりmyoouはだまりません

こちらも見ず知らずの他人と同一人物視されていい気分ではありません

**from myoou**

それはあなたという特定の個人とやりとりしている以上僕の方も同じ状況です

何が嫌なんですか？自分が統失だというのは恥ずかしいですか？

それよりも統失ということを自覚せずに被害妄想を根拠にした言説をばらまいている方が有害で危険で恥ずかしいです

ぼくは一貫して「あなたは統失に見えます」とだけ主張しています

**from myoou**

いいえ、あなたは統失にしか見えません

病院に行って治療を受けてください

ぼくが言っているのは最初からこれだけです

匿名であるぼくの意見など何も信じなくていいので匿名ではない医者の言うことを信じてください

医者から統失ではないと診断されたならぜひそう主張してください

**from myoou**

myeeeuとmyoouは同一人物ですこれは間違いありません

他のIDはぼくではありません

したがって少なくともぼくの視点からは、あなたが二人以上の人間から統失認定されているということしか言えません（tokoro10さんとぼく）

これを信じなければおそらくあなたの信じられる事実はどこにもありません

あなたはひたすら自分の信じる道を征くのでしょう

**from myoou**

ぼくは「自分が常人である」とは発言していないしそう思っても居ません

「あなたが統失に見える」という主観的な事実だけを述べています

馬鹿にしたいわけではなくあなたはぼくの中では「自分が統失であると全力でアピールしたい人」にしかみえません

おそらくぼくを含めた複数人がそう感じているとぼくは思っています

そしてそのようである以上あなたの意見にはすべて被害妄想が含まれ得ます

自分の中から「こいつとこいつは自演」という認定を消して状況をシミュレートできますか？

**from myoou**

あらゆる書き込みが何らかの作戦や謀略の一環であると思っているならその認識は捨てるべきです

危険な考え方です

**from myoou**

ぼくはmyeeeuですけど、tokoro10tenの人とは同一人物じゃありません

同一人物だというのはあなたの勝手な思い込みです

ぼくはあなたが強い被害妄想を持っていると思っています

被害妄想は典型的な統合失調症の症例です

その他のあなたの文章からも強い統合失調症の雰囲気を感じます

あなたは病院に行くべきだと思います

EDIT：追記です

ぼくはmyeeeuですが、tokoro10tenの人と同一人物だと認識されているようです

信用出来ないならあとでmyeeeuのアカウントから同じように発言します（出先用のアカウントなので）

これはどう頑張っても間違いで、これが間違いである事実があなたの発言から説得力を失わせています

あなたの「同一人物による捨て垢粘着」という主張が被害妄想であるという根拠になってしまうからです

自分の中での「こいつらは同一人物である」という思い込みを一度捨ててください

何人から言われたのかわかりませんが、多数の人が「あなたは統失かもしれない」と思っていると思えませんか？

もう一度言います あなたは病院に行くべきです

病院に行ったことでぼくやtokoro10さんが困りますか？何かの謀略だと思っていますか？

そういうふうに思っているならなんともいえませんが、とにかく本当にお願いします

一度でいいので行ってみてください

9597,2016,2,czj54p4,nan,Bitcoin,1458208789,0,1,0,"&gt;Any rational person would update their models based on empirical evidence.

No one is that kind of rational. Seriously. No one.

&gt;I see no reason why I wouldn't change my assumptions afterwards. If anything, posting what I think will happen is a way of keeping myself accountable, it helps prevent confirmation bias in the future.

I agree with that and try to live up to it as well. I've noticed that people with your assumptions tend to be resistant to changing those assumptions when shown to be wrong. 

For example, its been rather fashionable in certain circles to confidently predict a collapse in the dollar due to QE. For instance, we see this in ""economists"" like Peter Schiff. The argument goes something like this:

We are printing too much money. That will cause hyperinflation and currency collapse. If it doesn't happen, its because the printing itself is preventing the collapse. But this can't go on indefinitely, so  it will collapse. 

This leads to an unfalsifiable claim. If the currency collapses, its because I'm right (even though that's not necessarily true). If it doesn't, I'm still right, it just hasn't happened yet, but it will! 

As you can see, this is playing tennis without the net. Its impossible to be wrong. Well as Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead. ",nan

It should not be surprising that even in 2017 with all our advanced technology and understanding that we still do not even fundamentally understand what consciousness even *is*. Investigate the hard problem of consciousness. Examine the arguments of the aftermentioned Thomas Nagel, whose *qualia* effectively refuted materialist explanations of conscious experience ~40 years ago. And most of all look at James Ross' [Immaterial Aspects of Thought.](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/43151/ross-immateriality.pdf) That our consciousness is related to, but entirely dependent on a body can be demonstrated syllogistically (Ross) and it is therefore highly probable it survives death, even as a purely intellectual examination (to say nothing of divine revelation, NDEs, various reported experiences, and so on). And to say nothing further of St. Thomas Aquinas's position that to even comprehend transcendental qualities was enough to demonstrate the transcendence of the intellect (which he works out more in the *Summa Contra Gentiles*).

If there is a nail in any coffin it is in the materialist/reductionist view, and when the most brilliant living philosopher, himself an atheist, says so, I think you can pack your bags and go home.

A picture is worth a thousand words, though you definitely don't need to use that many to describe the image. Please attempt to just give a general idea of what the image is. For example, ""A man and a woman sit in what appears to be a gondola. They are facing each other and are far away from the viewer. The lake that they are on glitters in the evening light of the setting sun behind them, and the deep blue and purple sky fills the rest of the image."" Add as much detail as you feel is necessary.

**4chan &amp; Pictures of Text**
---

* When writing the Username and Timestamp headers in 4chan threads, only include the Username and day of the year if either changes.
* Standard 4chan header formatting (Military time is used, i.e. 4:20:00 PM is written as 16:20:00): **UsernameMcAnon**, 4/20/2017, 04:20:03
* Feel free to make spelling and grammar corrections if you truly believe that it will not significantly change the heart of the content, but include a disclaimer if you do.
* Regarding 4chan or other threads, it is always to the benefit of both the transcriber and the reader to find the original thread. Always try to find and include a link to it if possible.
* If there is quoted greentext like this:

&gt; be me, lvl 3 cleric 

&gt;surrounded by mind flayers

* ...then make the &gt; sections each a full paragraph break apart. Like so:

\&gt; be me, the Vice Head Transcriber  
{blank line}  
\&gt; writin' formatting advice all day long

**Note:**

Most of the 4chan greentexts are already archived online in their original state. A large percent of the time you can find the original post by going to Google and putting in one sentence from the greentext image inside double quotes; this will make Google search for the exact sentence. The more unique the sentence, the better luck you'll have in finding the original post. Then you can just copy / paste / format and it will go much quicker!


---

**Comics**
---

* Please ensure that any text in the picture is transcribed verbatim rather than just being paraphrased.
* Write the text and describe the scene in the rough order that it is intended to be seen. For example, if there is text at the top of the panel, then a scene in the center, then more text at the bottom of the panel, perhaps a punchline, write it like:

**Panel 1**

**Person:** This is a sentence that is going somewhere funny!

*(Description of the scene)*

**Person:** This is the punchline!

* In short, transcribe the picture so that the heart of the joke remains the same, and so the transcription would be as funny to read as the image of the comic.

It is then perhaps a mystery as to why it should turn out to be crucial in understanding particle physics—why is the universe beholden to this abstract structure we developed for unrelated purposes?

Better athletes tend to stick around the league, although obviously there's way more to it.  This helps clearly define measurable athletic ability though.

That men view women as the source of their self-consciousness (which is a form of suffering). We (women) make men self-conscious by rejecting them.

And that men who haven't dealt with that well are in a state of pathological resentment. Which of course we see the results of all over the internet with nice guys and some percentage of red pillers (don't know enough about them to say how many of them are in this camp).

So Peterson has already given you a way to understand why some amount of his fans are the way they are. They're a part of this resentful--and as you well observed--Eve-blaming category of men.

Which is also why Peterson is always preaching to men to become attractive to the opposite sex. Because men who don't do that don't have a good chance of resolving their resentments and becoming mature and responsible. 

Jung said he'd rather be Jung than a Jungian. And I'm guessing Peterson would rather be Peterson than one of his fans.",nan

&gt; The technology industry has come under increasing pressure from some government officials in the U.S. and U.K., who contend that bolstering data security, primarily through encryption, will diminish their capabilities to fight terrorism and crime, and will result in those sources &amp;quot;Going dark.""

&gt; The study, titled &amp;quot;Don&amp;#039;t Panic: Making progress on the encryption debate,&amp;quot; does acknowledge encryption will poses challenges in some instances but by no means will dictate the landscape of future technology products.

&gt; Many consumer Web services are unlikely to enable end-to-end encryption because their business models rely on analyzing data and then monetizing it through advertising.

**Thud! (9/10)** and **Snuff (8/10)** - Terry Pratchett. After finishing **Night Watch** towards the end of last month, immediately went out and grabbed Thud! and Snuff. Sam Vimes' character arc has to be one of my all time favourites and although by Snuff his development is mostly complete, these last two books are a fantastic way to cap off an already stellar set of books. Absolutely loved the darker tones of the later books especially, with Thud! and Snuff being no different. Will use one of these in probably the sequel bingo square.

**Uprooted (8.5/10)**  - Naomi Novik. For some reason I've struggled to get into books that are written in first person recently, however after constantly hearing great things about Uprooted i decided to give it a shot. Took me about 100-150 pages to really start getting connected to the characters and the story but once I was hooked I couldn't put the book down. The atmosphere of the book was probably what caught my eye the most, the underlying sense of dread and despair felt by the Agnieszka trying to combat the Wood was brilliantly done. My only real slight criticism is something I've seen a mentioned a few times on here now, the romance in the book didn't really capture my attention all that well. It wasn't to the point where it detracted from the book at all but it was just wasn't a memorable part of the characters' journey's for me personally. Will be using this for my award winning bingo square.

About 150 pages into **Theft of Swords**- Michael J Sullivan and I was instantly hooked from the first chapter. Can already tell this will be a really fun read

 &gt;Imagine you have a contract over a payment of a fixed amount of Bitcoins in the future. Could be a mining contract, could be a salary contract, etc... But could also be your coins parked in a Bitcoin-bank (e.g. exchange wallet).

&gt;I guess these contracts are not prepared for the current case of a chain split. Especially when both sides claim they are ""THE Bitcoin"".

&gt;What is the legal solution in such cases?

&gt;I expect many more (small) forks originating from the latest Bitcoin UTXO to new alt coins instead of starting at a zero-distribution every time over and over again. So it is better to get the right understanding in the community as soon as possible.",nan

Quite literally THEE earliest possible incap you can achieve, and it's AoE and castable on the move and all too ya know. Mind you, you've only thrown one spear., and not used your counter if you're accurate. 2nd spear landing if they jump away is also good. In addition there is a 1.2s root and +3 damage which would also apply to  EXE now, so your EXE now does more damage and roots also in round 1 which is a pretty good tool to use if you wanna be sticky

Round 2 the speed rite for fleet foot gives you the mobility needed to leave fights if need be. You get 1.3s of 50% MS in fleetfoot, another 1.5s out of it. You now have options to pursue, or evade much better than before. 

In addition both of the above rites are 100% useable with your EXspace, so in 2 swings you can not only self heal, and get a 65% movement speed buff instead of the standard 50% from having the second rite, but the 2 swings essentially also refunds your cost for casting the ex form.

Round 3 is chalk full of decent rites, up-to-6 hp heals is always good on Shifu. Not nearly as broken as it was, ik QQ more about brainless shifu mechanics. Tendon swing giving an additional 5% energy for landing means that if you land it, it's the only R ability that gives you a net-energy gain, the second instance of where an energy costing ability, if used properly will not only not cost shifu energy, but actually propel him forward in energy.  The 3rd, being a 3s cooldown for actually being accurate with spears, if you throw and land both spears, you knock off 60%  of the cooldown to a 3rd spear, which also makes you sticky, and if you suck dick at hitting moving targets, hitting walls works with this too. 

Round 4 20% spear length, or a 1.5s 25% movement speed haste for landing max charged m2's are both great great ways to stick to ranged hero's if I'm not mistaken

Round 5 speed spin... Uhh you ever hit immaterial and ult on Shifu with the fleet foot speed rites... It's a 100% movement speed immaterial whirling hurricane of death, which is heavily self promoted by the amount of energy gaining abilities shifu has that have an energy cost but when used well the cost is entirely mitigated, and actually gains you energy. They're hearding you toward being able to get more ultimates and use more ultimates and this shit in round 5 is a nightmare lol.

Given that they're not changing any of this shit, and giving him buffs in addition to all of it... I for one am willing to welcome my new Shifu overlords",nan

A lot of Shakespearean villains are very simple: they want power, they want to rule, and if somebody's in their way, they kill or neutralize him. We don't know how Hamlet's uncle feels about Old Hamlet, nor does it matter. We assume marrying the queen and ruling the country satisfies him. He is a villain of simple tastes.

Iago is more complicated than that. Sure, he wants power, he wants that position in the military that he thinks he deserves. But if he just wanted the promotion, he would've stopped after he got Cassio fired. He's after a very specific emotion. He wants both Cassio and Othello to feel the same powerlessness and isolation that he feels. He wants Cassio to know what it's like to lose Othello's favor just as Iago lost it. And he wants Othello to know what it's like to be second best, by making him feel like his wife loves someone else more. To achieve these things, Iago has to use far more than brute force. He has to manipulate people, get close to the people he hates most by pretending to love them, then betray them at the right moment. At times he has to use real emotions for false purposes. And he feels justified in this because from his point of view, they did the same thing to him. 

There's something very human about Iago. Not many people want to rule Scotland, but all of us have experienced envy and frustration and shame.",nan
