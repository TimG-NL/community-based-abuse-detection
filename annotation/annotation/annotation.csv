AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

38,2017,5,dgyrwj1,,pie,1494514497,0,0,0,"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)",,,,,,,,,

I could also downgrade all my 3 attackers and buy TOTY Ramos and maybe move TOTY Marcelo as CB and get Alba as LB

94,2016,2,czjb59c,,DebateFascism,1458211623,0,1,0,"&gt; Could you elaborate on this point?

There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.

&gt; I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me.

You could be right. I am not *such* a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line.

But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

121,2017,8,dkzs8gr,,OverwatchUniversity,1503656800,0,0,0,"Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults.

Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult.

Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. 

If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above).

-----------

With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. 

Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen.

If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting 1 shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey.

It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots.",,,,,,,,,

It felt massively unrewarding in the final DLC when it became apparent you had to run 10~ games for one rank of a random UR. The only reasons it wasn't as widely hated as ME:A's, I think, were there were many excellent guns in all rarities (so the grind to max everything but UR was extremely rewarding), and the game was just a blast to play. You could play with purely the objective of trying new builds or just popping some heads or playing some space wizards and it was all gravy. This game currently lacks both of those things.

Airlines have deferred keeping track of all the visa rules to [Timatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timatic).  However cruise lines in the past have generally required you to have a visa for all the countries at which your cruise will visit.  This has caused some friction between passengers who don't want to pay for a Chinese visa when a transit should work and the cruise lines who want to keep it simple and require passengers to have a visa.  So you should check with the cruise line to make sure they can board without a visa.  Both at boarding in Osaka and at immigration in Shanghai they will need to show proof of booked tickets onward to a third country within 144 hours.,,,,,,,,,

For context I have 2 boys aged 6 and 7. When they mess up my first course of action is to make them feel like I understand them. I don't believe they will listen to me as well if I don't do this. I say things like ""it makes sense that you are angry at your brother, cause he hurt you, but that doesn't make it OK that you threw a rock at him"" then I talk about using words and other ways to deal with anger without lashing out. I also talk a lot about "" how would you feel if your brother did that to you "" kind of thing in an attempt to cultivate some empathy.

I know the listen to me based on how they change and grow. I try not to lecture too much or punish too much because they are kids and they are just learning these lessons. But they probably will end up avoiding trouble just so I don't bore them to death with another bs dad lecture. But hopefully my understanding and compassion is an example for them to follow.

Say what? I definitely didn't like the mockery, but I also don't think the halving was priced in. I think knowledge of the halving was priced in, ie. it wasn't a surprise to anyone that a halving would occur. But the actual process of pricing in the halving was a gradual one, for two reasons: a) it wouldn't be fully priced in until post-halving, when the threat of negative halving effects would dissipate (e.g. miners dropping off en masse), and b) the post-halving supply shock (of sorts) takes months to price in in and of itself.",,,,,,,,,

In fact my only comment on human diets was that not eating at least some vegetables is unnatural for humans. And I was originally replying to your statement of
&gt;I know of people with cats and dogs who feed their pets vegan pet food. It's not too extreme when you think about it. Yes the animals naturally eat meat but when you buy pet food that isn't meat is it?

Edited to add, that trying to paint  the situation as a choice between factory farmed meat or a vegan diet, is as invalid an argument as using crappy  bargain brand pet food to justify feeding obligate carnivores vegan diets, or  someone using vegan junkfood to justify not eating vegetables. 

Picking the worst possible example of something you disagree with, and comparing to a really good example of something you agree with just makes it look like your position can't stand on it's own, and like you  think the people you are trying to convince are too stupid to see through the way you warped the facts.

262,2017,5,dgz2gv8,,Games,1496158342,0,0,0,"The Javik DLC from Mass Effect 3 is a good example of why management and publishing is a problem. They kept needing to extend and got pushback. Javik was supposed to be a bigger part of the story, but they had to cut it to work on other things. They kept a bit of it on disc because they wanted to finish it after the game was ""finished"" (already rated etc). After that, they finished From Ashes and it was ready by Day 1. So it looked like Bioware decided to cut a chunk of the story out for a few bucks when it actually wasn't the case at the end of the day. 

I do feel that Andromeda was mismanaged by both dev and publisher though. It's so obviously a rush job in the areas that were hard. Like branching story and those little details. They worked on combat and open worlds instead. 

So they spent 40 million on it, which is a bit too low honestly. ME3 was 40 million. Andromeda was a whole new engine AND a revamp of everything gameplay related. ",,,,,,,,,

For a low-maintenance, everyday work look where I want sheerer coverage, I LOVE Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC cream. This has a very natural finish but still enough coverage to tackle covering blemishes--and never any skin irritation. I'm on my second tube of this now, I get it at CVS and they always offer promotions for PF products. I think it's a great value product for the price point! 

I've also found Too Faced's Primed and Poreless primer to be a great daily primer for smoothing out the look of textured skin for acne scars, and this also hasn't clogged my pores.

Update: The AG271QG is a great panel. You can immediately tell it's an IPS, and loaded up with Overwatch, I didn't notice any dropped frames or screen tearing. Secondly, I went to lightbleedtest.com, and found no excessive light bleed anywhere. However, the top right corner of the screen does glow more than the rest of the panel. Thus to say, it's inconsistent, but the bleed isn't horrendous. Lastly, it's designed really well. All the stand pieces are metal. I feel confident it can survive a desk bump. It also has a hook behind the monitor as a headphone holder, and there's a hole in the middle of the stand for cable management. The title is 27"" 1440p 144hz IPS G-Sync, and it sells for $650.

That was literally the longest that I could last, and I was up with guilt-ridden nightmares for both of the nights in between. The thing is, I wasn't working a sales gig (at least not in the traditional sense): I was a ""talent scout"" for an incredibly shady organization that sought to trick parents into purchasing ""acting and modeling lessons"" for their kids.

There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.

That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session.

Unless, that is, they paid even *more* money to have their kids stay in the bogus class.

448,2017,8,dkznleg,,DotA2,1503654374,0,0,0,"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out.

**EDIT**
Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation: 

* Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.
* ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info!)
* Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.
* While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and *maybe* it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.
* All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead.


So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE  WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED!"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before.",,,,,,,,,

The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much.

Once upon a time there was an 18 year old man who really *really* loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it.

Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her.

'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love.

Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well.

Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak.

The man knew what he had to do.

""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything! The wedding was saved!

""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment.

""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan.""

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

i think that if it was on raw with maggle, jbl and byron/king i would have been completely uninterested.  the commentary team on LU is not the greatest, but striker and vampiro are reasonable good and helped me enjoy the match.  too much choreography and flippiness, which as i said is just not my cup of tea.  but solid work.

also, it helped that i had no clue what Puma's finisher would be and wasn't sure if Mundo is using his same old finisher from WWE.  so that added some element of suspense which improved the experience of the match.

it feels like it's too soon in the series to be bringing in the heel owner/authority figure storyline.  like, we don't even know the characters yet, it feels like this oculd have been a season one finale type of revelation or something, but whatever.....i'm not used to this format of seasons anyways, so i'm not going to get hung up on that.

\# 36 - Using the equilibrium law for the equation, Q = [PCl5]/[PCl3][Cl2], Q must equal 2.5 / 1.5, which is less than 2, or less than Kc. Since it is less than Kc, it must shift towards the product side to reach equilibrium.

Get suffers in the early game due to lack of clear and pressure, since the shield is garbage early. If you are looking for a snowball duo lane then pick khepri over geb. 

Mid game: khepri's mitigation becomes very useful, and his pull can guarantee a kill. Geb shield starts to come online and can provide better peel  

Late game: here is where the 2 gods separate in role. Geb has a much better initiation and can set up team fights and picks more easily than khep. Khepri is better at extending team fights because of his ult and can provide better late game peel from the root/pull, where as geb can guarantee more survivability. 

Conclusion: both gods are top tier supports. They both provide different things to a team comp and can be picked on preference. I think it is very ignorant for you to say that khepri is bad since he has one of the biggest pick ban rates in the spl and can change a team fight in many ways. If you are looking to snowball out of the duo lane pick khepri. If you want to farm until late game pick geb. They both do their role well, and because of that u can't say that khepri is bad. Kuzembo is a bad support because he lacks everything. Sure u can say that one is bad compared to the other but that doesn't make him unpickable which is what u seem to be saying. ",,,,,,,,,

Everything, because it's total and complete bullshit. No-one has done anything to you, but your group has terrorised women for a year and half. Don't try and pretend to me it didn't happen, I've watched it happen. I watched gamergaters publish the addresses and phone numbers of my friends to intimidate and threaten them. I still see it every day.

&gt;I dunno for some reason strangers make up violent crimes that I've committed.

You fly the flag of a group and you have to answer for what it does. You can't just say ""no I'm one of those moderate KKK members"".

I had wanted to learn for years but always let myself be convinced that I was too old to start learning. I'd always been involved with the chapel band at my school (private Christian school) as a vocalist and watching that show brought back lots of memories of being in a ""band"". After finishing the show, I decide if a klutz like Yui could pick up the instrument, so could I. I've been playing for about a year and a half now but only started taking lessons with a good teacher about four months ago. I'm progressing and am excited about the prospect of writing my own material. Vocals were always somewhat easy for me but now that I'm gaining another tool, music is a whole new thing for me. Also, for anyone curious, I'm 20, going on 21 this year. Never too old to start.",,,,,,,,,

This was over four years ago and still haunts me.

I was at the eighth grade dance. I didn't have very many friends in middle school, so I was just kind of dancing by myself in the center of the mash. I hear from behind me a loud ""Yeah, Adam!"" and I turn around to see its the girl I had had a crush on for basically the entire year. Before this moment, I don't think I'd even had a conversation with her. We make eye contact, and she turns around, pointing her butt in my direction, an obvious invitation to grind (yes, it was one of those dances, the whole thing was a disgusting mess. Of course, I didn't think so at the time). Now, I had been a fairly sheltered kid. I had no idea why she was doing that or what I was supposed to do. She dancing a little, going up and down, looking back waiting for me to do something. 
Then it dawned on me, I knew exactly what to do. 

I turned my back to her, backed up into her, and we rubbed backs for a solid ten seconds. She turned around with the most wtf look on her face and disappeared into the mob of people.

1038,2017,8,dkzqeyo,,AskReddit,1503655752,0,0,0,"We adopted a cat a few months ago, so we're still getting to know him. He's about 18 months old, give or take. When we brought him home, he seemed like a regular cat, but we quickly realized that he's super smart. 

He can open our shutters; he works a paw between two of the louvers and pushes them up or down until the whole shutter is open, so he can watch the birds in the backyard. 

We've got a wall niche where he loves to hang out, so he's up off the floor. There are light switches on one side, and after seeing someone turn on a light ONCE, he pawed at the switches. Of course he got a reaction from us, so now he regularly plays with the switches to make us laugh. 

Any door or drawer that is even half a centimeter open is likely to end up being opened and investigated. He's ended up in some pretty interesting hideouts. 

He's amazing at playing fetch -- his favourite toys are pompoms from the dollar store, but he'll retrieve just about anything if he's in the mood. 

He knows what birds are -- if you say there are birds in the backyard, he'll go to the window to watch (his favourite thing). Better yet, if I grab my laptop and ask him 'want to watch birds?' he will start meowing, then run over to curl up in my lap and watch a youtube channel I found that shows birds and squirrels at a feeder (it's actually designed for cats to watch when owners aren't home). 

When we realized how bright he was, I decided to deliberately train him to do some things, to keep his mind busy so he wouldn't be bored and wreck the house. Within two weeks he had learned to 'come', 'sit', 'beg', 'shake a paw', and 'gimme five' -- he's a cat, so he'll only work for treats and only if he's in the mood, but it's still astonishing to me that he's so incredibly trainable. 

Edit -- I forgot his best 'trick'; he saw one of us turn on one of the roombas, and because he LOVES to chase them around he figured out that he could push the button on top twice in a row and make the vacuum start up any time he chose. Now every once in a while we'll hear him take off downstairs and pounce on the vacuum so he can stalk it. People tend not to believe us until they see him do it, but he seems to like to show off this particular trick for guests. Several times now we've been visiting with someone in the living room and the cat will just appear... meow... swat the vacuum... then deliberately paw the button. My mother-in-law went nuts, she just couldn't believe it -- 'that wasn't an accident, he had to push the button two times! Oh my god! You need to get that on video!' We're definitely going to try, but it's tough since most of the time he does it at 1am when we're asleep! :D  ",,,,,,,,,

Stop trying to suck up to him, just because he's essentially telling you what you want to hear. It's what I used to say you did with Dragz. You overate him as a player so much. It's because he was a big part (even essential) in creating the modern PTC. 

Write music simply told you that noble is filled with cowards.... so what 1 person (who btw hardly played with noble) now proved everything. Ever thought about how he clearly has a grudge with me?? It's why he said all that stuff. 

You completely overate how laggy Noble was while discrediting PTCs lag. 

You fine well know inspire, steez, Dragz, Han and keytro have been called laggers time and time again. 

You also have NO IDEA. who was in Noble. If your going to take 1 thing from this stop telling me who was in noble. Japs didn't play with NOBLE. I used to play with japs along with Dragz and supernice.... BEFORE NOBLE. 

Almighty was never in noble. 

Pinda wasn't either. 

Also you don't understand how people like Akira came into the clan. Of course he wasn't recruited. But it was when Titan split up. Players got thrown around, people's were friends etc. You couldn't split everyone up. Noble black was nobles top 8 players. That 8 has as much lag as your top8

Straps stop trying to discredit me. It's ridiculous. You fine well know what you said to me while in PTC. about how people overate my lag. Y don't you make a fuss about inspire?? He used to lag TERRIBLY and you knew it. 

You had months to fight noble. MONTHS it does not take that long to set up a match. If both parties want to play a match, regardless of time zones/jobs/school. The time can be found. I've played enough clan matches to know. 

Noble or PTC were not better than each other. 

There were weak links and carry players. 

PTC was nothing without you, me of steez. SS was right they absolutely would of beaten PTC without those 3 players. Same with Noble of it wasn't for me and Supernices defence the clan would of been nothing, obviously would of been a great clan, but the best? no. 

So forget the clans. The clans don't hold any value really. 

I didn't get tired of you saying you were the best. It was your constant discredit of Noble. Most of the stuff your saying straps isn't true. Of course noble had lag like pretty much everyone. but it was exaggerated, exactly the same with PTC. 

Noble was NOT a clan when we fought. It's the same question, why was flukes PTC when we clan matched??? because Noble wasn't a clan that's why. ",,,,,,,,,

After that, he noticed Amethyst's weapon and showed her he used something similar in the form of a sharpened wrench that he made for ranged capabilities. Their social short comings kept them from connecting until they played. After a short round of roughhousing that left Amethyst unable to move on the floor.

&gt; Ivanka Trump, the president&amp;#039;s daughter, and Jared Kushner, her husband, had pushed the president to hire Mr. Scaramucci, seeing him as a way to force out Mr. Priebus, the former national Republican committee chairman, and his allies in the West Wing.In that, Mr. Scaramucci was successful.

&gt; Mr. Scaramucci&amp;#039;s swift departure is an early indication that Mr. Kelly intends to assert his authority over the operations of the White House, and that several of the big personalities there - including Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump and Mr. Bannon - may be inclined to defer to him.

&gt; The president still values Mr. Scaramucci, according to people close to Mr. Trump and his family, and is hoping to find another, less high profile, position for him in the White House - although it is uncertain if Mr. Scaramucci would be willing to accept a demotion.

1213,2017,5,dgyt87e,,OverwatchCirclejerk,1494515140,0,0,0,"A guardian angel to those who come under her care, Dr. Angela Ziegler is a peerless healer, a brilliant scientist, and a staunch advocate for peace.
After obtaining her MD and PHD in Switzerland, Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.

Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.

During her Overwatch years, she once dressed as a witch for Halloween.

Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. One example was the development of the biotic rifle by Torbjörn. Torbjörn provided assurances that the device was only intended for healing, but Ziegler maintained that this was setting Overwatch down a road that could lead to the weaponization of biotic technology, and that she had only conducted research in the field on the condition that it would not be used for offensive purposes.

Seven years before the present day, Ziegler was involved in an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander Jack Morrison to end the King's Row Uprising in London, England. Earlier the same day, Ziegler argued with Morrison over Overwatch's inability to intervene in the conflict due to the English prime minister expressively forbidding of any Overwatch action within the United Kingdom. Dr. Ziegler expressed her concern for the thousands in the city who needed medical aid, and lamented how Overwatch was made to help people, not sit on the sidelines. After Jack authorized the mission, while preparing to board an aircraft, Ziegler welcomed Cadet Lena Oxton to the team. She commented on how her inspirational words convinced Jack to authorize the mission, and how he was very invested in her career, and had asked Ziegler to keep an eye on her. Zigler then told Oxton how she could call on her if she ever needed any help.

In Overwatch's final days, the group was faced with a series of allegations, and Ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the United Nations. In light of the fight between Overwatch members Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, Ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable. They had drifted further and further apart ever since Morrison had been chosen over Reyes for the position of strike commander, and that rift had widened despite her efforts.

Mercy helps the innocent
When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by war. Though she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled, hoping to make a more peaceful world.

When Winston issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Mercy was in the Middle East. Mercy was unsure if Overwatch should be restored.

Hope that helps.

I've gone to dermatologists, removed sulfate shampoos, tried natural ingredients  (tea tree, neem oil, etc), tried salicylic acid shampoos, coal tar shampoos, the zinc compund head and shoulders uses, selenium sulfide shampoos....the whole friggin gambit. Here's what works for me: first thing, i never wash my hair the same way twice. Mixing it up somehow helps. My shower looks like a crazy person's because I use so many different products in rotation. Then I do a multi-step process that seems to work. First I use a generic shampoo in a quick and dirty way that kind of breaks up the oil in my hair. Then I use a salicylic acid shampoo (dermarest, specifically.) The chemical exfoliation helps the next step work better. Then I rotate between a 4% rx ketakonazole shampoo, coal tar shampoo and head and shoulders. Hope this helps.",,,,,,,,,

I decided to take the September LSAT about three weeks ago. I PT'd with a 156 diagnostic, and I am aiming for 170-175 on test day.

I am on a very tight timeline and have been studying 10-12 hours a day. Today I finished the LG Bible; I finished the LR Bible about a week ago.

Again, referencing my tight timeline, what are things I should be doing and focusing on in this next month and a half before test day? I plan on doing each and every Game using 7sage videos, but what are some other things I can do to get myself into the 170-175 range?

I've reached out to other members of the community with similar questions - I am curious about your input.

Cheers",,,,,,,,,

1310,2016,2,czja7dc,,LearnJapanese,1458211179,0,30,0,"So I've found this post about the same topic, discussed from a Japanese speaker's point of view:

http://cpplover.blogspot.jp/2012/12/blog-post_18.html

There's a link to this /r/anime thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14z01e/looking_for_instances_of_an_often_used_quote_that/c7hqldn

Which leads us to this /r/bestof thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14zw76/alayavijnana_explains_the_meaning_behind_the_he/

I don't have the time to read all these posts so here's my answer.

殺す is 'to kill' and 死ぬ is 'to die.'

「彼は殺しても死なない」 literally means ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""  

You will find translations like ""You couldn't kill him if you tried"" because the English sentence I gave above apparently doesn't sound natural.  Literal translation would still be ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""

The Japanese sentence 「彼は殺しても死なない」 is as self-contradictory as ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him"" but somehow feels natural.  In short, I think it's more about what kind of a sentence feels natural rather than the implications of the words 殺す/kill and 死ぬ/die.

I haven't thought this through but this might somehow be related to the ""Japanese doesn't have sarcasm"" trope.   Or I might be completely off the mark.  I must go out now...

This just isn't a good idea. You have to attack the problem at it's core. Rage quitters are not the issue you are trying to address here. It is salty/toxic players. 

For example, you miss a save. Your teammate ""what a saves"" you and votes to forfeit. You don't vote and so he just leaves. That player is clearly willing to give up 15 minutes. If we include some time of increasing time length ban and that person then isn't willing to give up 2 hours (or whatever) of time, in all likelihood they're just gonna stay and be toxic. Play against you. Drive around aimlessly. Talk trash in chat etc. Is that any better than if they had just rage quit? You have to understand that if someone who doesn't want to play is forced to play, in most cases they aren't really gonna try to play productively and win. Additionally, we can't forget about what will happen to all the people who have an unfortunate week of power outages, wifi drops game crashes etc, and are suddenly hit with an hour long ban even though they never rage quit once.

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it. 

&gt;THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

Example: if a car dealer sells a car he must include a warranty under law, so that sale is covered by law, but then if the dealer says no actually you have to pay an extra $x or i'm not delivering that car he can do that and is not violating any law.",,,,,,,,,

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of?

For example, a couple where both spouses make 50k/year will pay less tax than a couple where one spouse makes 100k/year with the second spouse having no income. 
As I understand it, spousal RRSP's were designed to allow the higher income spouse to put RRSP's in the lower income spouse's name in order to lessen the income gap and thus reduce the couple's taxes in retirement.
Since then however, those with a qualifying pension can elect to split their pension (for income tax purposes) and thus reduce the couple's income tax. A more direct and sure way of evening out a couple's income.

And I still want an answer to that. Your ""False prophecy from Satan"" came true, and built up the body. Now what? Do we add to the Bible? No. Because Scripture DOES in fact carry greater weight than some specific Word for a specific time and place. Scripture (aka your precious ""canon"") is for all times and all places.

(1) Many economists tie the 2008 recession directly to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.  The lack of separation between commercial and investment banks is likely tied heavily with the Recession. Things along these lines are difficult to prove though, as are many things economically.

(2) I, individually, don't have the right to limit power. But, as an American, I support and elect the people in the government. And the government does have the power to tax and limit power.  A tax on the richest of us (read: Wall Street) can be used beneficially to help the poorest of us. Robin Hood took from the rich to give to the poor. And the average person doesn't care about the globally economy of they're still dirt poor. And, because of income inequality, they're getting poorer, while the rich are getting richer. A Robin Hood tax could alleviate the wealth gap slightly.

(3) The fact that the media is owned by so few large corporations. The fact that in many areas you only have one choice for cable providers. I could go down the list. Monopolies exist. Many monopoly laws aren't being enforced. I don't need to create new monopoly laws.

(4) Yet, somehow, politicians still get paid tons of money from corporate donors. Look how many politicians on both sides of the isle are in bed with certain industries.

(5) Profits not being spent on improving the company should be taxed. They're doing no good and not helping the economy by sitting there. Do you really think that Exxon needs as big of a profit as it does?  Money should be put to use improving society, not locked away where no one can touch it.

(6) People do store their money in places like the Cayman Islands all the time. People, using creative tax ""loopholes,"" find ways to avoid paying taxes on their money by keeping it overseas. That needs to be stopped.

You don't have to agree with me. And, as I said, it's possible not all my ideas would work. I'm not an economist or an expert on the subject.

Now, rather than saying you disagree with my philosophy (it's clear that you have a more libertarian economic philosophy, which I don't agree with for a variety of reasons), why don't you say what you believe should be done to eliminate income inequality. Do you even think that's something that should be eliminated?",,,,,,,,,

1640,2017,8,dkzr1qe,,Gunpla,1503656075,0,0,0,"I hand painted with Vallejo for quite a while but now I'm switching to Tamiya. Vallejo is very forgiving in terms of brush strokes, but they're bad at sticking to the plastic (the primers are better, but still not great). Tamiya is harder to get an even finish with (retarder is supposed to help), but dries quickly and bonds well. With gunpla you're assembling painted pieces and posing, so being able to stand up to scuffs can make a difference. That said, the suggestion to use lacquer thinner is a good one if you don't mind the fumes. Vallejo does have a great color selection, plus lots of primers, varnishes, mediums, washes, etc. Whatever you choose I do recommend using a real thinner; water/alcohol aren't quite as nice.

I'd say get some cheap brushes that aren't bottom of the line, different sizes. Always use the largest brush you can for a piece, to minimize brush strokes. Invest in nice fine tip brushes for smaller details -- I like the gsi creos ones, you can get them thru Amazon. Strong, even bristles and predictable behavior will save you headaches when trying to paint the little stuff.

I use the alligator clips on sticks. I hold them by the clip while painting (sometimes challenging to find a place to clip it on) and put them back on the stick to cure.

Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful.

My viewpoints aren't even remotely offensive. If you've got a very thin skin, then yeah maybe my comments are rude and unwanted, but they certainly are very helpful comments.

&gt; I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit?

The views that I have aren't horribly offensive at all. Regarding women, I never said that they were ""worthless piles of shit."" It's just that Western societies like ours are under siege by feminists who say they want ""equal"" rights for women when they actually want female domination. Women are mentally and physically different from men and thus should not have the same rights that men have.

&gt; Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it.

Despite the number of downvotes that I get from cowardly, close-minded people like yourself, there are still a lot of people who agree with the things that I say. I believe everything that I write, and I'm sure that there are people out there who appreciate what I have to say.

I'm actually running 18/6, even since they are autos it shouldn't matter much. Also they are starting to spit out their first 5 blades leaves!

Back onto the problem, i plan on moving onto a MarsHydro II 400w, is it overkill for such a space (since height is really limited) or will it be fine?

You are far more likely in life to encounter steep drops then guns. 

And more likely to encounter a bike than a gun.

So your saying it makes more sense to just avoid those things if your not trained to use them correctly and safely?  You should avoid the edges of sharp drops, and not ride a bike in the street?  A rock wall isn't the only thing a kid might try to climb.  trees, buildings, bluff faces, fences...  shall I go on?

Kinda like you shouldn't handle a gun, and the solution is the same thing, but for one you want mandatory training?  So rather than waste money so morons can be justified not locking their guns up properly, how about we continue to teach kids not to touch them.

But I just thought it was stress, since I only really take it during the academic year.)  It also was messing with my sleep, I think.  (I've never complained about it, thus never diagnosed, but anxiety is typically comorbid in ASD.  And Vyvanse is known to exacerbate anxiety in people who have anxiety issues.)

Since they are so often found together (ASD/ADHD + anxiety), I'd probably look more at how the meds affect people with anxiety (if this is also a problem for you), rather than how ADHD meds affect people with ASD.

No side-effects on Adderall (XR and IR), though it doesn't give me the energy that Vyvanse does.  I kind of wish I could combine them, but my psych said no.  :(  lol

Neither medication ever left me ""hyper,"" and both increased focus.  Though Adderall doesn't quite work as well as Vyvanse for me in that regard...  It's all about how each med affects you, specifically, because everyone's biology is different -- even if we have the same disorders. 

As an aside, even people who *don't* have ADHD or similar will still usually get increased focus from stimulants. ",,,,,,,,,

I just don't want to watch the game slowly die again, be it from the game simply being out of touch with what the MMO crowd expects or because BPG runs it into the grounds.

1777,2017,5,dgyxcb3,,ClashRoyale,1494517130,0,0,0,"I agree with Log, Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, Skeletons, Cannon and Ice Spirit being very powerful for their costs. 

I personally think Ice Golem is good where it's at, as a cheap mini tank/distraction unit/skeleton killer who does very little damage and no longer has a ridiculously large frost nova.

Cannon itself isn't too strong in my opinion, it's just that it's too similar to Tesla and thus replaces it any time someone looks to add a non-Inferno tower defensive building. To me, the solution is to buff Tesla, maybe by allowing it to hit two targets like Ewiz (no stun effect) and slowing it's hit speed accordingly so that it's DPS doesn't get insanely good.

Tombstone I feel is fine, definitely an annoying card especially if you're using Hog Rider or Elite Barbarians, but it's low hitpoints make it reasonably strong against ground tanks and troops. Maybe a slightly slower stream of Skeletons would be good, but that might kill the card's usage entirely.

Zap is a weird one because for the longest time it provided too much value, but after the damage nerf I think it's found a good niche as a reset card and Skeleton Army killer. The problem with Zap of being an easily overleveled common won't disappear unless the developers address that problem, so unfortunately overleveled Zaps will continue to be a nuisance. But in challenges, Zap is pretty balanced because it doesn't kill too much and the duration of it's stun isn't too long. The most frustrating part about going against Zap is how quickly it's deployed when compared to Arrows, which did receive the deploy time buff recently but still feel considerably slower. So perhaps a slight nerf?

Let me know what your reasoning was with the cards you mentioned!",,,,,,,,,

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

I'm reasonably familiar with seg funds in general.  Not so much in the specific anymore.  So take it for what this is worth, I did a 2 second drive by because my initial suspicion is that your statement is false.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.

1839,2017,8,dkztdu2,,Entrepreneur,1503657356,0,0,0,"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen.",,,,,,,,,

Go watch all the videos on daveconservatoire.com if you are hazy on music theory.

2) to cover, my process is first find midi versions of the song, and load them into a daw. Identify the imoortant/memorable parts of the song, and delete the rest. Make an arrangement that will work on the POs limited polyphony and number of patterns. Take advantage that you can repeat patterns if possible. Dont try to make a note for note cover. Instead, make a ""caricature"" of the song.

If notes/chords arent available on the PO, you may be able to play the song in a different key. If its only a few semitones different, no one will notice, and most people wont care anyways. Might not work for all songs, but should for many.",,,,,,,,,

1. Black cleaver is a great item for the cdr and utility and you should probably build it every game. In the early game, you sacrifice a little bit of dmg compared to ghostblade but you should still be able to win lane with bc. The health will keep you alive esp vs true dmg opponents and 20% cdr is a ton. Can also buy a tiamat in between there if you feel you need more dmg. BC also helps transfer riven into the mid game.

2. Spirit Visage is still a viable option as it is gold efficient and offers really good components. However Maw and Scim are most often times going to be the way you want to go. The AD and MR offered by Maw is huge not to mention Moar armor pen, and the passive will give you more sustain than SV however you have to reach low health for it. Scimitar is also useful with the QSS tons of AD and lifesteal.

3. Although it definitely makes sense, it was a little surprising that everyone had the same exact answer of early hexdrinker vs ap match ups. SO DO IT

4. Deadmans is good for vsing a team without a lot of crit, and the moves peed passive is good on riven and helps with flanking. Randuins is good for the crit Champs like Yasuo, trynda, and some ADC aoe slow is really nice too.

5. This guy is still not someone you really wanna fight. I'd definitely recommend reading all the posts for this one but basically you want to kill him pre 6. Nidalee posted the build of BC&gt;Lifeel steal item&gt; Lord Dominik's Regard (LW)&gt;life steal item with lucidity somewhere in there. Try to roam.

6. It's more of preference. I personally like mid because most of your apponents are squishy but will often have cc to lock you down. Again hexdrinker is good here and QSS for Champs like Annie or Tf. Jungle riven is doable and fast Qing the minions is how u do it. However you should look to get rolling early as you fall off if you dont.

If you're looking for examples: here's the town of [Bullettrap](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/364006) - a 100% coloured town in the Northern Cape and here's the town of [Allandale](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/276132) - 100% black. I have never found a 100% Asian town in South Africa, because, like Whites, they are never a majority in any municipality and therefore when apartheid ended a lot of non-Asians moved into their areas because they were of a better economic standing.

On natural vs fused, naturals have generally higher stats than fused, hence why they are stronger. You'll see this once you get to compare your first natural and fused. You are guaranteed a natural 5 start in a month of playing.

First, if you offered Ryan Murray a million dollars to do this with a puck he couldn't: https://twitter.com/NHL/status/848695374076420096/video/1 . The only thing Murray is better at is stretch passing and stick checking. His positioning needs a ton of work. His speed is light years behind Johnson especially since the knee injury.

Second Nuti and Carlsson at this point in their careers could never skate the minutes and responsibilities JMFJ does. Do you wanna see Nuti on the PK? I don't. Maybe you didn't notice that sometimes Nuti played 10 minutes a game because he was flat out not being defensively responsible. I like the guy as a future play maker but come on. Carlsson is good and promising but far from a sure enough thing to bail on what was an elite shut down pairing this season. Defensemen aren't nearly as plug and play as offensive guys.

Third Josh Anderson is a winger, so he can't replace Dubinsky ever. I love Wild Bill but he, and even Andy are 10x more replaceable than Johnson. Perhaps you haven't heard about this Dubois guy we have, or Kolesar, Abramov, Milano, Stenlund, ",,,,,,,,,

1979,2017,8,dkzy9fs,,AskThe_Donald,1503659757,0,0,0,"Net neutrality basically means that the people who control the guts of the internet have to treat all data the same. It doesn't matter if the packet contains a few seconds of a Netflix movie, some text headed for Reddit, a gamer's data, Skype call, encrypted mystery numbers — it all goes in the same pipe as everything else; it all moves at the same pace.

The reason this is so important is that ""the people who control the guts of the internet"" are now a very small number of very large corporations who would really like to inflict *horrible* things on us, but are being prevented from doing it by these rules. ""Oh, you wanted to Skype your family? Let's just slow that data to a crawl so it basically looks like you're tunneling through 1995. But if you upgrade to our *premium* plan, which includes Turbo Skype, only from Verizon, you'll enjoy crystal clear quality for only $19.99 more a month!"" Basically, without net neutrality, your ISP would receive legal permission to digitally torture you for money.

The better solution would be to have robust competition, so if your ISP ever tried this, you could switch to one of the many others. Then we probably wouldn't need net neutrality rules. But right now, many people only have a couple ISPs they can use, so that's not much help.

Net neutrality is not a philosophically ""correct"" thing to do, because it represents a lot of intrusive regulation in the tech sector where that's not desirable, but in the situation where we find ourselves, it's better than the alternative, which is frankly horrifying.",,,,,,,,,

2036,2016,2,czj4sf6,,Truecels,1458208628,0,0,0,"Humans as well as other animals have more 'biologically programmed' mating strategies, but basically they divide into two categories
1) have as many children as much as you can and with as many man as possible so that your children will be as diverse as possible. 

This is the main mating strategy for women in underdeveloped societies: south america, africa, etc.

2)pair-bonding strategy. Have one make that will take care of you and your offspring and offer him sexual exclusivity so that he will be sure the children are all his and will take care of all of them and stay with you. This makes the man to feel so-called 'love' for the woman. Marriage was invented for this specific strategy. It was invented to encourage people to use this mating strategy so that man will not focus on competing for women but focus on science, writing and advancing of society. That is why societies that were more traditional managed to become much much more technological advanced than the ones that had the 'fight each other to pump and dump women'.


If a woman already had sex with many men, she knows subconsciously that the pair-bonding strategy is less and less likely to work for her as man are programmed to bond with females who are only theirs because they do not want to end in a situation to provide for a child that is not his.
In this case the instincts of the woman 'switch' to the first strategy- be pumped and dumped by the most strong, the most seductive men and have as many children as possible to make sure at least some of them survive. She needs to have more children because without a man to provide for her a lower percentage of children will have chances at survival. Thus she becomes what we call today a 'slut'.

This two types of strategies were vastly studied and appear in animals and also in humans.


In a civilized society a 'paid-bonding strategy' is the norm and allows the society to advance. 
A society that has 'pump-and-dump' as a strategy will become more and more a shit-hole. This is the reason that black communities in US live in such poverty and violence. This is their strategy. Be aggressive, fight other men, prove to women you are violent enough to survive to have a chance to pump her.

The whites had a very different strategy and created a very different societies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory

Read about a very interesting species where males with different mating strategies have different colour (a proof that the mating strategy also has genetical factor)

Literally nobody is pretending homophobia is extinct. They may insinuate we should be better than that, but that is not the same thing.

2176,2016,2,czj4cxz,,AskReddit,1458208425,0,1,0,"That is the solution.  You're putting too much stock into sex, once you bang a hooker you will see that sex is just that, sex.  It will give you more confidence.  I don't know what you look like, but I'm willing to bet you're not the ugliest looking dude out there and I've seen some ugly ass guys with decent girlfriends.  One thing to remember, is that leagues and standards do matter.  If you make $30k a year, are fat, and don't much going for you; it's not reasonable to expect to hook up with a fine ass blonde or what have you.  Just something to consider.  

One last thing, don't kill yourself over not having sex dude.  I guarantee you that it's not worth it, don't do that to yourself and your family. You will always pay for sex, whether it's with attention, emotional support, security, money, cars, houses etc... Everyone pays for pussy cause girls don't give that shit out unless they get something in return.  Just my $0.02",,,,,,,,,

2196,2017,8,dkzreo0,,Advice,1503656394,0,0,0,"An excuse is standing somewhere between you and the next step you need to take. – If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way.  If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.  This may be tough to accept, but it’s the truth.  Stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  The only person who can truly hold you back is you.  So no more excuses – it’s time to change.  It’s time to choose what’s best for YOU.  Oftentimes when we feel stuck, we are waiting for something magical to happen.  We wonder when the winds will change in our favor.  We do this instead of embracing the present and admitting the change we need to make.  What is keeping you from stepping forward?  If not fear of failure, then what?  Insecurity?  Laziness?  What is your excuse?  We all have one.  And when we focus on our excuses more than our steps forward, we walk in a circle and fall into the familiar pit we call “Stuck.”",,,,,,,,,

Dude responds:

&gt;wat, no I'm not... I am about everything else though... the dick is the only good thing on me, that's not the point... He implied that I said ""blacks don't have bigger dicks/ women usually don't even like big dicks"" because I have a small dick and I was saying that because I'm butthurt . By posting my 8 + inch penis I provided proof that I'm not saying that because I'm butthurt about my small penis because I clearly don't have one and that the reason I said that is because I have seen how women feel about my penis. I provided proof for my personal experience to back up my claim. It's not about a fucking dick.",,,,,,,,,

&gt; A team of researchers from Italy&amp;#039;s University of Trieste and the Cambridge Graphene Center recently made significant headway in this direction when it successfully demonstrated that untreated graphene can be used to interface with neurons without damaging their integrity.

&gt; The team&amp;#039;s research, published in ACS Nano, details how it used rat brain cell cultures to discover that untreated graphene electrodes interfaced perfectly with neurons.

&gt; &amp;quot;These initial results show how we are just scratching the tip of an iceberg when it comes to the potential of graphene and related materials in bio-applications and medicine,&amp;quot; said Professor Andrea Ferrari, Director of the Cambridge Graphene Centre.

Sometimes the questions that you ask can actually restrict the people who can answer your survey. Some common examples of this are marking a survey as open to everyone but requiring:

* which state they live in
* male or female for gender
* which way someone votes

It's okay to only want responses from a particular group of people (Americans, Males / Females, 18+); you just need to make sure that you are requesting those things in the demographic section of your survey title.

Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12.

2273,2016,2,czj9shy,,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1458210985,0,2,0,"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. ",,,,,,,,,

I have Mediacom. 100 mb down 20 mb up. 

There are only two (actually 3 isp's) here in the Desert. Two that matter (Mediacom and Verizon) the third is a local isp, but speeds are not their strong suit. 

I have the fastest consumer grade connection available. For 70 bucks, it's not bad. 

My ping issues are from having 3 roku's  in the house, which are always on, plus phones, laptops, tablets, etc... 

My pc is hard lined, everything else is wifi. Which, I turn off when my roommate is out. So the roku's, and everything aren't interfering whilst I play. 

But, Mediacom will not dual connect us, and Verizon does not connect on my side of town. So, I pay for everyone else to use my friggin Internet. Which sucks.

While in flight a warning light indicated that the bomb, called an Mk 6, wasn’t secured properly so a crewmen went to check on it. While he was inspecting he accidentally grabbed the release hatch lever instead of a hand-grip to pull himself up. This sent the 8,500-lb. device crashing into the bomb bay doors, forcing them open and plummeting the bomb 15,000 feet below. Fortunately, the nuclear head for the bomb was in a separate location and the bomb was not armed. The bomb detonated on impact, leaving a 75-foot across, 35-foot-deep crater. It destroyed the home and property of the Gregg family of Mars Bluff, South Carolina. The family of six was injured but there was no reported fatalities.

0 wins... discounting your 1 free win.

That deck isn't that clunky, I'd argue. Math is hard and I'm a bit drunk so here's the simplified, perhaps mangled version. You've got 9 cards that are playable by turn 1 and 2 (no stampede, explosive trap, etc, just minions). Drawing 1 of them makes you happy as a hunter. By turn 1 you've got a 43% chance to draw at least 1 of those 9 cards. Excluding 2 drops, you've got a 37% chance to draw a playable 1 drop by turn 1.

Statistically you should've landed a curve pretty often. All you had to do with this deck was stall until you meme them out of the game. What went so wrong?",,,,,,,,,

All your post tells me is that your emotions are tied to whether you win or lose. You're saying things a casual player wouldn't. Who cares if the other team has a 3-4 group. Who cares if no one talks? 

Remember that even two perfectly equal teams will have one team lose, and one team win. Sometimes there's a crushing defeat. The other team probably isn't talking either. 

And if you're done using the word casual so haphazardly, group up. Find other people to play with. Some might not be great, but stay with the ones that have synergy with you. /r/OverwatchLFT/",,,,,,,,,

Best Taijutsu: Guys 8 gates

Best Genjutsu: Itachis Tsukuyomi

Best Summoner: Jiraiya with his toads

Best Summon: When Sasuke summons that snake to save himself from Deidara, I don't remember the whole explanation but it saved his life so I'd say its a pretty important one.

Best Hokage/Kage: Hashirama by power but I really liked Minato, I thought his kunai teleportation stuff was really cool.

Best Teammate: Neji :(

Best Character Growth: This could go to so many people but I'm gonna avoid just giving it to the MC and say Gaara.

Best Shinobi: Kakashi, always willing to sacrifice for his village and friends, never afraid to fight to protect what he loves. Very wise and was given the task of trying to guide Sasuke and Naruto which was difficult given ones clan was slaughtered and the other was the nine tails jinchuuriki.

Best Kunoichi: Tsunade, very tough woman and the only female Hokage, one of the three legendary Sannin.

Best jutsu: Madaras Tengai Shinsei based on power, but I did really like Sasuke's rinnegan power in the Boruto movie(Amenotejikara )where he's able to teleport from one space to another in an instant.

Best Arc: Chunin Exams were alotta fun first time around. Either that or the Pain arc.

Best Villian: Tobi, very mysterious and powerful.  I remember being on the edge of my seat during his fight with Minato.  ""I could say I did it on a whim, or that I planned it, or that its war...or that its for peace"" - one of my favorite lines in the series.

Best Fight: This is so hard to choose.  My personal favorite was Kakashi vs Obito in the Kamui dimension.  Animation and emoitions were so high during the fight.  Itachi vs Sasuke is a close second, very tactical fight and a lot of fun to see unfold.

I also find it interesting how the man who wrote ""West Dickens Avenue"" and yourself have taken vastly different views of the war in general.  John Corbett wrote as if going out to Vietnam, seeing combat, going on patrols, and seeing the things he did was all just par for the course.

Making the address of the factory readily available on the package would let us as the consumers know who is honest and who is not. Once you know the address it would only take a few minutes to figure out how much manufacturing is actually done there and the big one, weather or not they are abusing a visa program.

Senator Sanders is promoting many ideas that are seen as hallmarks of the ""college liberal"". Things like universal healthcare, free or reduced tuition, socialism as a viable economic model, etc. The ""college liberal"" does not often find a candidate who shares these ideas with them.

Adults (I'll assume over 40 here) likely have carryovers from the Cold War and what socialism was seen as then. My parents for example, equate socialism with the USSR. While this isn't technically correct, they were both born in the 60s and were brought up being told that the USSR, and therefore communism/socialism, was their enemy. 

They have also seen firsthand the fall of communism/socialism in Eastern Europe and view an attempted return to that as horrible.

Now, again, these are very broad generalizations and I'm basing my thesis for the perceived adult dislike of Sanders on a single issue: socialism.

Many adults like Bernie. Many young people don't like Bernie and his policies. I am one of them. 

Neither young people or adults are monolithic entities. Both can have all sorts of different viewpoints.

Edit: also, some adults may have seen candidates like Bernie come up in the past promoted ideas like his that they approve of, only to watch them fail. They may be disillusioned. ",,,,,,,,,

Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch.",,,,,,,,,

2718,2017,5,dgytefr,,Vive,1494515223,0,0,0,"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved.",,,,,,,,,

Anyways, I was going to school for economics and pre-law, and once I graduated I took up electrical work with my father and opted out of law school. Best thing that's ever happened to me, but it's hard work, sometimes working with scum people, but the pay is great, and the fact you can work with tools and big equipment all day is awesome. The only things I don't enjoy is being on-call, my hands hurting after work, and the fact that I never know what time I'm going to get home. We work in a very specialized field, so don't take my experience as the majority.

As an electrician, or any trade for that matter, you will never starve; as in no matter where you go, if you do good work there is always a larger demand for work than the supply of skilled electricians/plumbers/roofers etc. 

Don't let the white-collar people fool you...my dad paid for my sister and I's college by running an electrical contracting company. We make better money than a good amount of the office jockeys, but they will always say the contrary.


I would suggest going to school for Construction Management also, while working with a general contracting company doing every trade you can get your hands on. Or specialize in one thing like electric/hvac/plumbing and get out of school and get real work experience.

I was well aware that I was not seeing his entire testimony. However, reading his full testimony, I was struck by the fact that he never actually gives an explanation: 

&gt;Q. Investigator Wiegert, did he give you the license plate number for Teresa Halbach when he called you?

&gt;A. I don't remember the entire content of our conversation but, obviously, he must have because I was asking the dispatcher to run the plate for me.

&gt;Q. Did you not trust that Investigator Wiegert got the number right?

&gt;A. I don't -- That's just the way I would have done it. I don't -- It's not a trust or distrust issue.

This is not actually an explanation. If he says at some point that he was verifying information about the case, I haven't been able to locate that statement. Later on redirect, Kratz assigns Colborn this explanation, which Colborn accepts:

&gt;Q. Mr. Strang asked whether or not it was common for you to check up on other agencies, or perhaps I'm -- I'm misphrasing that, but when you are assisting another agency, do you commonly verify information that's provided by another agency?

&gt;A. All the time. I'm just trying to get -- you know, a lot of times when you are driving a car, you can't stop and take notes, so I'm trying to get things in my head. And by calling the dispatch center and running that plate again, it got it in my head who that vehicle belonged to and what type of vehicle that plate is associated with.

He's not talking specifically about this case, he's giving a general explanation of scenarios in which he might call to verify a plate number. In the Halbach case, he'd clearly gotten enough information that he immediately went to follow up on a lead by interviewing Avery. I'm stumped as to how or why he'd have written down Teresa's license plate number separately from the other info about the case he'd have needed to question Steven Avery.",,,,,,,,,

2794,2017,8,dkzq3cm,,ShouldIbuythisgame,1503655595,0,0,0,"**Earthlock: Festival of Magic** is a chill RPG that's pretty breezy.

**Siralim &amp; Siralim 2** are monster capture games that you can pretty much play indefinitely. They're relaxing games that be focused on or played while winding down for the evening/netflix. The games aren't linked, so you can play either. Siralim 2 has a much more focused narrative and progression system. Siralim 1 is basically ""here are the mechanics, do whatever.""

**Stardew Valley** has been mentioned before, but this game is love. If you haven't played it you should at least check it out. It's similar to Harvest Moon/Rune Factory, though very much a western game.

**Bastion** was great fun and pretty chill. It's kinda action-y, but I didn't struggle with it despite having shitty reflexes. It also has a very soothing narration and ambiance.

**Shadowrun Returns (Original, Dragonfall, Hong Kong)** isn't a difficult game, and it's got an amazing cyberpunk atmosphere. The games are turn based and not particularly hard if you play them on the lower difficulties. The lose condition (you died) just means that you have to restart a mission, and none of your companions die permanently. 

**FEZ** is a charming platformer/puzzler that just oozes style. It's great fun and I definitely recommend it (though it's creator is a real dickhead).

**Decromancer** is a card battle game with an interesting world and a fun premise. The gameplay is really enjoyable if you're into card battles (more like strategic combat, really). No lose condition- failing a battle just means retreating and healing up.

**The Sims 3** is my favorite of the franchise, and you can pick up the expansions really cheap as they go on sale frequently. If you've never played it, I recommend it. You just sort  of dick around with your family of sims and play through a life simulator. None of the expansions are necessary, though I find Ambitions adds the most without changing the way the game plays.

**Mages of Mystralia** is an action-y little RPG where you play a fledgling mage learning her spells. There's a very fun spellcrafting system and the game hasn't been difficult. No scares, and deaths aren't terrible.",,,,,,,,,
2795,2016,2,czjecvf,,FinalFantasy,1458213207,0,2,0,"Mighty Guard is a must.

If you want to farm early ability points before you get to the final dungeon, Level 5 Death will also be very nice.

White Wind is useful.

But definitely make Mighty Guard a priority, it's easily one of the best spells in the game.

---

When I meant farming, here is a video of the spot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-l0R16u-YU

This is when you get to Castle Bal, a little after you get the Ranger class.  Most people like to max out Rangers because they provide the ability to attack 4 times (8 if dual wielding which I believe was a Ninja ability).  So freelancer with Dual Wield == massive damage (also pretty cheap, avoid this method.  It completely removes the fun out of some fights.)

Late game prior to Neo Exdeath in the final dungeon, you'll fight Movers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdX9xv8V6CA

The title says rare mob, but quicksaving causes them to be the second mob spawn.  This is your late game Abp farm, but it has nothing to do with Blue Magic.

TL;DR:

Mighty Guard

White Wind

Level 5 Death (if you want to max some jobs out early.)",,,,,,,,,

yet this has not been the case. when catalonia was managed by the anarcho-syndicalist CNT, workers got much better conditions from being able to actually decide them. please stop spouting ahistorical garbage.

&gt;And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

materials mined and collected BY WORKERS, machines built, shipped and used BY WORKERS, in factories and establishments built BY WORKERS. the only relation the capitalist has in this relation is control of capital, they contribute nothing to the actual production of material goods or buildings, and make money by leeching off of their work like parasites.
&gt;You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

this is in itself irrelevant to my response, and also bullshit. this money goes into wallstreet and doesn't come out. besides, anything invested in wall street came out of the labour of workers, and belongs to the workers, not the capitalists, who contributed nothing. they have no reason to be alienated from their own profits

&gt;Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

contracts mean nothing if the alternative is starvation, and alternatives don't matter if they are all equally shit. coops may not pay higher-up employees as much, but i can tell you that someone working in a coop earns much more than someone working in a sweatshop. coops also ensure better job security for the workers, as they are far less likely to fail. where did you get 14% from, breitbart?",,,,,,,,,

Most people who use cracks use them primarily because they simply have no means of  affording them due to their national socioeconomic situation, but we've given back in the form of recommendations, videos, reviews, word of mouth to friends, providing, admittedly, a minute but constant and diversified local exposure for the product and those who are able to afford it are perhaps persuaded sometimes to acquire it. 

I'm not trying to say piracy actually helps companies sell their games but, analyzing figures and statistics, it doesn't hurt them nearly as bad as they claim and, in many ways, provide, if nothing else, at least a discernible and reliable form of local advertising.

It's true that some of those signals involve appearance--think clothes and makeup--so there's a relationship between successful signal-sending and attractiveness, but not really *innate* attractiveness. I have enough friends of both genders to know that beauty isn't the same thing as flirting skills, and the latter is what gets people dates. 

I'm not trying to start a fight here; I'm rooting for you! As some stranger on the internet, I know I can't change the way that you feel about your appearance. Maybe I *can* help convince you that a different approach could be more successful.

Exfoliation in general is  great for keeping your skin smooth. Personally, I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris).

But I also don't have a clear understanding of when the system decides the ""neutral"" start position. Like on the PS4, if you accidently have the stick pushed up on start up, the game believes that is the neutral start, so the rest of the game you're fighting against moving forward until you reset. I figure its the same here, where the start up of the motion control resets or is set at some point of the game that I'm in a less than optimal ""neutral"" position that i have to reaaally fight for control. 

I could also try upping the sensitivity and as others suggested, continue using the stick until i neeed fine tuned aiming. Which I guess isn't too much of a deal since I am playing ink heavy weapons like brushes, rollers, and MG.",,,,,,,,,

I'm not as theologically educated as you are, but as I understand it we have Councils in response to heresy as it arises. So we had Nicaea in response to the Arians and Chalcedon in response to the monophysites. So why wasn't *ex cathedra* defined after the Great Schism or at the Council of Trent?

I hate that /r/politics is a total Bernie ass kissing festival, I really want to hear other's opinions so I can actually think about why I justify my own and possibly so I can change my views and be better informed. And I totally agree with you and I am well aware that political revolution cannot come from executive action and sadly it seems that most Americans (especially select republicans who blame everything on Obama while we have a Republican dominated congress) believe that the president is basically a king. But I do have to disagree with you about Bernie supporters trashing Hillary and focusing totally on Bernie's strengths. Although it may be true with some (college age liberal redditors [my closed minded peers whom I attempt to distance myself from]) most people in my friend group and family who are Bernie supporters do not believe that Hillary is as bad as any republican. I promise you I prefer her above any of them as much as I believe her mistakes are rather serious. Some of the anger at Hillary that Bernie supporters may possess could  be evident because the Sanders campaign itself is not directly attacking Hillary, resulting in the Sanders supporters simply wanting their opinion of Hillary to be heard.  Anyway thank you for your response, hopefully some day that reddit can become less of a Sanders echo chamber and that people can have reasonable discussions. ",,,,,,,,,

3074,2016,2,czjetfo,,Drugs,1458213424,0,3,0,"Alcohol and marijuana are completely different for me. 

When I'm high, everything becomes trippy and I am more out of it. It's harder for me to complete tasks (ex. using a microwave, cooking etc). It feels like my motor skills/speed has decreased, but I usually am able to catch/throw things as good as I can sober. Even though I am more out of it, I am told I become chill as fuck and I can keep my cool (even though it doesn't feel that way lmao). There is also a burnout period with weed, making you have an overwhelming need to sleep. Driving home is not impossible but HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. This is good for chill outs with your friends, solo-sessions, self reflection, listening to music and movie watching (no complex movies because I usually lose interest quick). Weed hangovers are a thing, but they don't physically hurt. My head is a bit light headed, and usually I get moderately depressed. Can last up to 2 days depending on how much you had.

When I'm drunk, my surroundings get desensitized to my brain, if that makes any sense. My motor skills/speed/spacial awareness feel the same, but in reality they're in the shitter. I become very flirty when drunk. I say the truth a lot (sometimes too much), and if I get too drunk I become very loud and make an ass out of myself. Alcohol (depending on the person) has a period cal the ""dizzies"" where you feel like [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/a/ae/Hyperspace_falcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20130312014242) is happening to you. Driving home is impossible when smashed, seriously get a cab. This is good for bars, social events, and meeting new people (all in moderate amounts, because drinking too much is not good in any situation). Alcohol hangovers are a thing obviously, causing heavy headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, lightheadedness and regret.

When mixing the two, both the desensitization and trippy combine, fucking me up. It's almost impossible for me to do anything (ex. last time I mixed I watched myself spill a whole box of cereal on the ground and was too fucked to clean it up). I'm still flirty, but not loud. Do not drive home when doing this, you will not have a good time. My body (specifically my face and fingertips) get really fuzzy, almost a pins and needles feeling, but it feels really good. I recommend more weed than alcohol when mixing, cause imo it feels better and it reduces hangover the next day. The hangover is a combination of the two others, so it's not pleasant. Mixing is good for house parties, clubs and concerts.

**td;lr - They're very different, combined they mix some qualities. Everyone is different, so this might not match exactly what you'd feel, but it'd be similar.**",,,,,,,,,

3077,2016,2,czj5jn0,,Accounting,1458208984,0,1,0,"Also, you are right that low working capital is better, but of course companies need some level of WC to operate. (Eg if you are a retailer you could reduce your WC by selling down all your stock, but what happens after that!)

Therefore what you are really concerned with is looking at trends in working capital and understanding whether there are ways to decrease working capital without affecting other things. If you decrease working capital by $5m, this is $5m of cash available immediately to the company, sometimes working capital management is the difference between success and bankruptcy.

-looking at days of sales or purchases in working capital balances helps understand the operating cycle of a business, again something you can't do with cash. Eg if a company has 10 days of sales in debtors, this means it takes 10 days to convert sales into cash. If creditors are payable in 5 days, this means you have to pay your expenses quicker than you collect cash. Overall this means you have 5 days of working capital that the company has to finance somehow. Looking at days sales or purchases rather than absolute values lets you compare trends even if the company has grown or declined significantly. Again, you can't see this looking at the cash balance.",,,,,,,,,

I would say that people CHOSE to keep me around. I fucked up all my relationships with everybody during my 10 plus year drinking career. I gave everyone the chance to break it off cleanly, and I wouldn't have blamed them. If someone thought I had fucked up enough to the degree that they didn't want to associate with me, I never begged them, nor do I hold it against them.

I am currently a philosophy major and existential philosophy can really help. Try reading Kierkegaard, Camus, Satre, and most importantly Nietzsche. They are all atheist except Kierkegaard but even he gives good advice about how to deal with anxiety when we realize the shit-storm of a world we live in. These philosophers try and teach what do in the face of the nihilistic meaningless world we live in, which when realized can really dampen ones mood. Hope this helps and good luck. Cheers",,,,,,,,,

Danger 24D 5CL 15CP 9T 3G vs Freo

R2: Sloane 25D 8CL 15CP 15T 1G vs Hawks

R3: Sloane 31D 8CL 24CP 9T 1G vs Port

Danger 36D 9Cl 20CP 2T 3G vs Melbourne

Total:

Sloane 80D, 25CL, 52CP, 28T, 2G

Danger 97D, 25CL, 60CP, 17T, 7G

**Discussion:**

Dangerfield is on top for all listed stats other than equal in Clearances after 3 rounds. An arguement can however be made for the quality of opponents. Adelaide faced and beat fellow top 5 opponents in GWS and Port Adelaide, as well as the lowly Hawks. Geelong faced Freo (11th after 6 rounds), North (15th after 6 rounds), and Melbourne (8th after 6 rounds). Note that Geelong only narrowly won vs North.

Dangerfield has the stats, but has accumulated these stats in a team lacking midfield strength and facing lowly opponents. 

Sloane is only slightly behind in stats, and would be considered Elite for all, and has versed much tougher opponents. 

**Verdict:**

Both are good stop fighting.

In terms of writing, my biggest criticism is pacing. It's always been my contention that she should've been introduced as an NPC much earlier in the game so that we could get little snapshots of her personality or her opinions on current events.

It's hard to put into words how flat-out wrong the median opinion is.  It's honestly more sad than anything else.  How people can be so mis-informed is just beyond me.  I personally blame The Guardian and the sad lack of economics education in school.

I don't understand how someone can say something so flat-out wrong as:

&gt;f it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

And be taken seriously.  It's just amazing how little interest in reality this place has.

&gt;If it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

This is just wrong.  A flat out lie.  There is no evidence to suggest this and I don't know why you'd bother writing it out.

&gt;And it won't operate for ten years - solar is cheaper.

Solar and coal don't compete as solar is intermittent and requires large amounts of redundancy.  When solar is capable of running at all times we might be having a different conversation.

&gt;This is the economic reality.

No, it is not.  This is a lie to fit your priors.

&gt;Your whole act on this subreddit is pretending that you are the ""smart guy"" who ""faces the realities of economics"" (which by some bizarre coincidence always lines up with the Murdoch/Coalition party line) - so how can you justify promoting coal?

Because India lives in horrific poverty and coal allows them to rise out of it.  The 100% renewable study commissioned required India to be 1/7th as wealthy as us.  I'm not comfortable with consigning a sixth of the planet to abject poverty because they had the misfortune to develop after us.

Also yes, I do promote economic reality.  It should say something that I then line up with the LNP a whole heap more than the ALP.  Something about the ALP being a bunch of incompetent buffoons lying to the Australian people.

&gt;If we give a billion dollars to these scam artists we will never get it back.

Ok.  I'm not going to pay back my home loan.  That's how these things work lmao.

&gt; That's why the banks are refusing to back it.

They're refusing to back it because the federal ALP are refusing to back it.  This is known as sovereign risk.

&gt;Their economic modelling, no doubt dismissed by the likes of you as ""lefty nonsense"", shows that the mine will be a failure.

Then it will be a failure.  That's fine.  The infrastructure will not solely be used by Adani.

&gt;And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of any objections.

Reasonable objections have been met.  This is probably the most stringently regulated mine in the history of the world.

Every other objection requires it to be blocked through legislative fiat, which the party of free markets will not do.

You are an exception throught we need more people like you

I hate communities that do this kind of things, i can repair the quirk and even add or quit some things but you say is no use, that ""flower spam"" already has an stigma so it's going to be rejected even if it's good to go just because people hated the original... ok im done i'm not here for this shits thanks again man (or woman idk) but i'm done

Don't worry about ideas, i have several, i'm going to tell you something ""flower spam"" was the sixth on the list of possible quirks for this, i choose it because it was funny and really diferent to anything i see before, unique you can say, in a begining it was just that, spam flowers, useless right? but then i start thinking

¿Can flowers grow in any surface, or just in soil?

¿Can flowers grow in living beings? 

¿Another creation quirks use something to create things, they didn't appear from thin air, what does the flowers use? 

I like the idea, I began to plan things, start writing concepts, organizing my ideas, etc, four days later i was good to go and even then is incomplete

the other quirks i have planned we're rejected because 

a) they were to similar to other quirks, both from this page and from the series

b) they we're stupidly op

And since i write this another ideas came to my mind

Just three of the ideas i think off

Muscle presure: this quirk allows the user to put strain in their muscle compresing them allowing to use the 100% of the human muscle power or even increase it beyond the human limit, more than 100% 

Rejected because it was to similar to one for all, it's weakness even where that the strain the body goes after using the quirk break the users body

Golden form: the user can transform for several seconds into a special form that heavily increase the strength, agility, endurance, etc, and gives the power to fly, after it's use the user collapse from tireness

It is based on the súper saiyan yes, but I don't think it was that usefull, i wanted to create a quirk that can be use effectively in tandem alongside the users own capabilities, this was more like a ""last resort"" attack so no

Magnetization: the user can magnetize his body to atract metalic objects from his sourroundings to use them as weapon, armour etc, he needs to be carefull or otherwise the objective can travel to fast an knock him down with a powerfull blow

To boring

3445,2016,2,czj5a34,,Eve,1458208859,0,10,0,"A small detail to add - there *is* such thing as ""too much speed"" when you're trying to decloak smaller ships, and I'd recommend not overloading your MWD when trying to decloak.

First, a few basics; then, an illustrated explanation:

 * Use the Centered Tracking camera setting to always get a reliable angle on their position when they decloak.

 * Always double-click in space instead of clicking the decloaked target and approaching, because once an object ""no longer exists"" in Eve (destroyed, cloaked, warped off-grid, etc.) your vector of movement gets messed up in most cases.

OK, so:

**1.** [Here you are in your Sabre](http://i.imgur.com/IGaCz0I.jpg), which has its own collision model. The covops also has its own collision model. Your goal is to get within 2000m (global decloak radius) from the *edge* of the pinata's collision model.

**2.** [You start burning at the guy (let's assume meh skills and a nano)](http://i.imgur.com/Btiso70.jpg). The covops will only decloak if *during a given tick* your collision model intersects with their model+decloak radius. In the case of this Sabre, there are two ticks during which you'll get a decloak, so that's good.

**3.** You might be tempted to overload your MWD so you can ohmygodgettohimbeforehegetsoutofmybubble. Thing is, [when you overload your MWD you are basically spreading apart your collision-per-tick spheres farther](http://i.imgur.com/feMKByN.jpg). In this example it doesn't look so bad, because you had a really good vector in the first place. 

**4.** But yeah, don't do that. Why? Well, say that your trajectory is a little bit off. [In fact, here's the closest possible edge case](http://i.imgur.com/jnRRFwa.jpg). Basically you can see that you are actually passing too quickly through the sphere formed by the covops's modelRadius+2000m. For comparison, [here's the exact same vector without your prop overloaded](http://i.imgur.com/0vO9PBL.jpg). The more you increase speed beyond a reasonable number, the more you start counterproductively decreasing your allowable margin of error for your approach vector. Going too fast might even mean drifting out of heated scram range despite getting a successful decloak.

**5.** It seems like a really pedantic point to make when you consider the range of speed of Interdictors, I'll admit. If you need some training wheels for a bit, just drop a second bubble along the way. But keep in mind that it becomes *really* important when you're in something like a fleet ceptor, though, since those are so fast and their model sizes are too small.

----

**Summary:** You want the ""right"" speed for decloaking, not the ""highest speed"": decloaking is tick-based and &gt;3km/s~ you might actually start fucking yourself over. Fleet interceptors may want to attempt to decloak at below max speed.

3466,2016,2,czj9ddn,,PuzzleAndDragons,1458210787,0,2,0,"Yes.  Yes there is.  There are, in fact, several better teams you can put together.  Your 120 cost is still going to slow things down until you rank up, but we'll work with what we can.  

1.  Devil team.  You have 2 red sonias, therefore you have a devil team.  Sonia / Sonia / Vampire / [King Baddie](http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=688) / Zuoh / Lilith or Lucifer // friend Beelzebub is a great devil team.  Now, it's way too expensive, so you'd need to rank up a lot.  Tone it down a bit and use Sonia / Vampire / King Baddie /  Big Baddie / Lilith // friend Beelzebub for a 103 cost version that'll get you started.  

2.  Urd is a great fire team leader.  Urd / Cao Cao / Ares / Yamato Takeru / Chiyome is a solid fire TPA team.  100 cost in the current forms you have, so you can run that, too.  Evolve your monsters as your cost increases and you can afford to - Urd first.  

3.  Bastet.  You have a great Bastet setup: Bastet / Vishnu / Meimei / 2 from [Susano (for shield) / Freyja (damage boost) / Meimei2 (more boards) / Vishnu2 (more TPAs).  Pair with Verdandi or Awoken Bastet.  This is actually an endgame-potential team, once you level up, evolve, and awaken everything.  The current iteration is right around 100 cost, depending on which flex subs you take, so it's also affordable.  

4.  Freyja.  She's got a new buddy in Sylvie, so if you can find a Sylvie friend and run them together, she's very powerful.  I'd go Freyja / Michael / Meimei / Bastet / Vishnu // Sylvie friend.  Also affordable for you.  

5.  If you can evolve your DMeta, you can run DMeta / Satsuki / Persephone / Lucifer / dark flex (whatever you can afford, this will be hard given ult DMeta is 70 by herself).  Ultimate Dark Metatron is extremely powerful, so this would be a ""something to work towards"" team.  

Try out those teams, get a feel for them, and see what you end up enjoying most.  It's good to work on a few teams, since sometimes one breezes through where another gets stopped, but you really have a lot to work with.  ",,,,,,,,,

Massage the oil gently into your skin, then rinse away. If you are using straight oils you may need to use a damp washcloth to get rid of residue. If you're using a commercial oil cleansing product it probably has emulsifiers in it so the reside will rinse away.

Back in the 90s I was an associate working at our local department store, in Housewares, Toys and Sports. Russ Trolls were all the rage for some reason, and we had both TV and print ads selling these ugly things for $14.99. We also had a cheaper and larger version by another company for $12.99.

This male customer got into an argument with the department manager because he SWORE the Russ Trolls were $12.99, and he DEMANDED he be sold one at $12.99. Soon into the argument his wife stormed over to the manager and claimed she saw the TV ad showing the Russ Trolls at $12.99 (nope, we had a copy of the ads in the office).

They got so loud and obnoxious that soon there were what had to have been nearly 20 adults, ALL yelling and demanding the Russ Trolls for $12.99. They actually ran down the doll aisle to grab them before we had the head of security finally restore some semblance of order and told the crowd that he would take their names and phone numbers and give them a call once everything was ""sorted out"". 

He offered to show them our copy of the ad (both TV and print) and a person yelled ""I don't NEED to see that! I KNOW what I saw!"".

When the sum total of the numbers of viewers and followers of Last Week Tonight alone more than double those of InfoWars, it would seem apparent that Oliver would have just as much sway in the realm of politics as Jones in terms of the average American. It is one thing to shine the light on a news organization founded on conspiracy and outright falsehoods. But he acts as though this fringe element is more dangerous to the general populace despite the fact that Jones clearly presents himself as the head of a media element with a very open agenda. Oliver presents his show as having researched findings (dozens of which distort the truth or fail to tackle an issue from more than one perspective) while peppering these segments with personal attacks and fabrications of his own. This tactic, which can be seen coming from Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, and the like, leads to days of media coverage from official news organizations who extol these programs as though they contain an ounce of journalistic integrity. These same comedians will then boast and proudly declare themselves a line of defense against fake news when they seek to bolster a particular world view, regardless of facts. However, when such criticisms are directed their way, comedians like Oliver will simply claim to be pure entertainers, knowing full well the effects of their shows on the political sphere.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots.

There are 2 theories: I was the last one hired and they didn't realize how many 14 year olds would quit in week 1 or 2- Chuck really was the creepy pedophile everyone thought he was and I was a guy. The place almost exclusively hired girls and every guy was eventually fired for very strange reasons. For instance, my friend was fired for ""sweeping the floor wrong"", whatever that's supposed to mean. Never did find out which it was. Creepydude died 15 ish years ago I heard. He and his wife didn't live in town, they lived in an rv and only came to town in the summer. That was the reason given for the bed in the basement, but it conveniently gave ol' Chuck ample material for ""jokes"" to the 14 year old girls.

The summer between 8th and 9th grade I started dating my SO and he gently encouraged me to start eating more regularly. It hurt so much to eat more than one meal a day and it made me nauseous. I felt like I just couldn't fit more than one meal a day in me.

I'm now ending my freshman year of college and I'm within an average weight range for my height and age. I still don't eat a lot, maybe one meal and a few snacks throughout the day. If I eat ""too much"", which usually is a big plate full of food, I feel sick and in pain, but I can eat more than I could before.

3657,2016,2,czjeam4,,BDSMcommunity,1458213177,0,2,0,"Hm. I think it depends on the sub. Chastity and orgasm denial have its place, but it's rarely forever. Guys put up with it because when sex does happen, when an orgasm is allowed, it's usually mind-blowingly awesome if the denial and the chastity was done correctly for their specific personalities. 

I have heard of nonsexual power exchange, especially from married couples where one person is kinky and the other is not, and no one is comfortable quite yet with their significant other having a sexual relationship with another. The ironic part is that D/s and power exchange is so intimate even without sex. 

It does seem common for straight Dommes to be into chastity. Whether that's a straight female thing or not is beyond my wisdom though. ha. I'm not male but I'm with you. A sexless relationship is -not- what I want and I would end a relationship that turned out to be sexless.

You have a very....generous interpretation of events. I haven't played either version since the WotL release on PSP, but I've played this game a dozen times so I'm gonna try and poke at them.

&gt;Delita then uncovers a traitorous councilor to Goltanna and executes him, earning Goltanna's favor. 

My impression is that the councilor was a fall guy for Delita's actions, who actually was the spy. It's possible he was another spy, but likely Delita simply framed him for the Hokuto plot and murdered him to get him out of the way and gain Goltana's trust. The only evidence is a witness that Delita himself provides, and he kills him before any objections can be made.


&gt; Delita successfully kills Goltanna, but instead of killing Orlandeau, Delita kills a lookalike and lets the real TG Cid go with Ramza in his search for the church's true goal. Delita then assumes Goltanna's position as head of the Southern Sky.

I've seen the idea that Delita let Orlandu go, but this is highly unlikey. The stand-in that Delita kills is a member of the Glabados church provided for the purpose of framing Orlandu for Goltana's murder (this is explicit in the japanese version that he's a member of the church). There's no reason to let Orlandu go except to betray the Templar knights (of which Delita is a member), and there's no way the church would provide a stand-in to help betray themselves. Further, Orlandu walks away with one of the Auracites when Ramza busts him out of jail. Considering the Templars gave him that stone, they had to have known that Orlandu escaped with it and Delita killed a stand-in or else they would have come looking for their stone to give to someone else to use.


&gt; At the same time, Valmafra, learning of Delita's betrayal as he speaks to Orran, struggles to carry out her orders to kill Delita. Delita senses her hesitation, and taunts her to kill him. Instead, Valmafra abandons her orders and serves Delita.

Does she? Or does he just capture her until after he becomes king?

&gt; Finally, Orran tries to uncover the church's plot and is burned at the stake as a heretic; it is unknown what power Delita had to stop this event.

The power of being the most powerful man in the country. If Delita didn't want Orran to die, he wouldn't have let Orran die.

&gt;  Delita spared Ramza several times, as well as spared Orlandeau

The second is questionable at best. The first is just not true. Delita never tries to fight Ramza, and given that he relies on Ramza to slay the Lucavi instead of trying to do so himself, it's unlikely he would have emerged triumphant. He probably also knew this having grown up with him, and hence never tried. Besides, as you point out, Ramza was needed for that whole Lucavi problem.

Delita MEANS well, but he becomes a black-hearted fiend at the end. Ovelia recognized it. Everyone else should as well.",,,,,,,,,

3800,2017,5,dgyt419,,Dashcam,1494515084,0,0,0,"&gt; 1. Is a dual cam worth it?

Yes, depending upon what you want to do with it.

So there are two types of dash cameras in this generation with parking mode. 1) With excellent parking modes, but only good-fair video quality; 2) With Excellent video quality, but lackluster parking mode.

Excellent parking mode is: Automatically enable/disable (lackluster is very painful in this department), Buffered recording (able to record a few seconds before, and after action detected), low power when in use (only writes to micro SD card when motion activated detected), voltage cut off feature (to protect battery.)

&gt; 2. Is having a parking mode feature worth it?

So is it worth it, well dual cameras definitely [improve parking mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGWGX1t8DU0). Do you back into the spot 100% of the time? Most don't. Even if you do, [you can be hit from behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhIXOxjyko).

Hardwiring is a little more difficult, I actually like GPS (speed/location only not directions), built in Wifi definitely improves your ability to check video, change settings, over a LCD screen. Some of the Parking mode dash cams have Cloud feature (stream anywhere - paid feature) and cellphone notifications of G sensor activation(s) while in park mode (generally free feature.) Some have excellent night mode, like the Thinkware F770 2 CH. 


Others are simply vehicle on dash cams, like the A119 - Excellent video quality day, good night, good shadow, lackluster park mode. You can hardwire this to hide wires, but most hardwire to an outlet that is only powered when the ignition is on.

----

I would say Excellent Park mode worth it, dual cam worth it, wifi worth it, GPS worth it, and being discreet is definately worth it.

Alone each one is hard to deal with, so having a combination of issues is always much harder to get under control. As far as telling them goes.... Do you feel it would have a positive or negative impact on your life and/or mental health help? I personally feel it's always best to inform anyone you have daily interactions with, such as close family members, significant others, and closest friends. I feel this way because it helps them to better understand you, your actions and reactions to situations, and how to help when there's noticable behavior changes. It gives you a chance to build a support group within loved ones. If they are like my family was, which it sounds as though they are, maybe having pamphlets or literature for them to read that is science based to read themselves, as you break the news to them. Ignorance of a certain mental health condition can have a huge impact on how the conversation will go and how they accept what you have and deal with on a daily basis. Generalized opinions of conditions are worse to ""break through"" than if someone just doesn't know what it is at all. I attempted telling my aunt about my ocd paraphrasing studies and research mixing in my opinion and personal struggles. It went horribly. She was not only confused but overwhelmed and it caused her to basically shut down on me. So, when I brought the issues to my mother and step dad about a month later, I had gathered pamphlets and even printed out short articles and explanations of said disorder from medical sites. I had in depth breakdowns for later reads for them once they grasped the basic concepts. This method was very successful and after a few days, once she accepted I had mental issues and I assume replayed my life and now understood so many things I'd done growing up that she hadn't previously, she came to me with questions and the door was open for discussion and understanding. So, literature always helps unknowing parties grasp the basics and may allow for deeper insight. Another thing to consider is, do you feel you could better approach them once you have seen a professional and gained more knowledge yourself? Would being treated first benefit you more, via therapy or meds or both, in how you handle Thier reactions to the info drop? Each person is different in what approach is best for them, as well as each family in accepting said info and how they respond to it. Majority of Parents know when something is wrong or not right with Thier children, so it may go a lot better than one may think. Then again, parents also tend to see and not believe because its hard to fathom you have a child with mental health problems. Often you see the parent feeling it's Thier fault, they did xx or xx wrong and caused it, or some sort of outside factor causing it. That's why it's important to provide short to the point medical and science based info for them to read. Sorry for the jumble mumble and it not being well organized or written. Super tired but wanted to offer my 2 cents and tiny bit of how I went about it personally with my family. Just remember to not overwhelm yourself or your ocd will get worse. Also, have a plan of action in place with lots of info ready and list key talking points. Short n Sweet, until they are ready to dive deep with you. Best wishes and luck to you!!! Lmk how it goes for you in whatever you decide. ",,,,,,,,,

1. Firstly, it is a legal issue. I support legalization. Whatever your position in the morality of cannabis or any other substance for that matter, the questions ""should you use it"" and ""should the government try to stop you from using it"" are far too often conflated. 

2. Second, it is a moral issue. You are right that there is no specific prohibition on this according to the bible, at least as far as I am aware. Therefore, it is up to everyone's own personal feelings, and people of the same religion may make different choices. As long as it does not control your life, that is. 

3. Thirdly, it is a health issue. In some cases cannabis can actually be used to ease the pain of highly uncomfortable conditions. Drugs, in general, are of course bad for you (though not even as bad as alcohol) and so I steer away from it personally for this reason. ",,,,,,,,,

Now, as for which Parks, I'm fairly well versed in East-End parks &amp; can give some tips if you have questions on specific parks. Glen Stewart, like a lot of Toronto green space, is a ravine. Specifically, it's a lovely series of walking paths through a heavily forrested ravine. 

There's not a lot of space for you to have a ceremony that wouldn't be in a walking path &amp; if the weather's nice, it will be a trafficked, though not crazy busy, path.

Now, the ravine aspect. The spring means a lot of the ravine green spaces are quite wet. While this could make them less trafficked, there is a reason.

I'll think on it &amp; see if I can come up with a good suggestion. In the meantime​, I would suggest browsing the city's park website, it is a good resource. If you think you find a good match, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

They have a mutation (a similar one is found in humans) that lets them digest grains better than their wild relatives. So some vegetables and grains isn't a bad addition to their diet, though I would still recommend  a dogfood low in grains and with meat as the first ingrediant. And even then their teeth, digestive system and nutritional needs are suited for a diet high in meat. They can live on a vegan diet, with the right supplements, but it's not at all what their body is suited for.
Cats absolutely are obligate carnivores, they can not digest plants very well. Even the best vegan catfood is as unnatural and unhealthy for them as a diet of solely meat would be for a rabbit or cow.

As for the stuff the petfood is made of, that depends on what  kind you buy. Some is  as you put it ""bread nuggets"" and made from animals too sick to be legally sold to humans. Some is actually made from decent ingredients. Though for cat food, the unwanted chicks from chicken hatcheries is, if handled properly, probably better and more natural for them than fish based foods, considering cats wild relatives are desert dwelling predators.

Using the bargain-brand crappy petfoods as an example to justify feeding a cat or dog vegan petfood is as unfair as someone using vegan potato chips as  an example to justify never feeding a child fruits or vegetables of any kind. Even with the proper supplements, a diet without any fruits or vegetables isn't natural for humans. (Even the Maasai people, who are famous for living mostly on milk and blood from their cows, do eat  some grains, legumes, and vegetables) And even with the proper supplements, a vegan diet is far from natural for dogs and cats, even if it is an improvement over the garbage sold under some pet food brands.

And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language.  But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say.  

I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn.  Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness.  I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about.  Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style.  

But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream.  

I've never met someone that could.  And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to.  It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about.  I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt.

My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. 4 years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying 4 yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want.

 Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. 

It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this. ",,,,,,,,,

I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes.
And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than 4 star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. 

Current top series:

* **Way of Kings/Words of Radiance**: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)
* **Song of Ice and Fire:** Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change. 
* **LOTR** Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling,  it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is *fantasy* with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.
* **Riyria Revelations**: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.
* **Dresden Files** I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role. 
* **Hard Magic Series**: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.
* **Ready Player One**:Just a fun read. The 80's were fun.
* **Enders Game**: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.
* **Wheel of Time series**: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.
* **Hitchhikers Guide series**: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.
* **Asimov's Foundation Series** More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.
* **Dragon Riders of Pern**:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?
* **Harry Potter**: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.
* **Artemis Fowl series**: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. 

Books I like:

* **Mistborn**: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.
* **Same for everything else written by Butcher**: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.
* **Legend of Drizzt**: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **Iron Druid series** I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **The Shadow of What was Lost** : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book.

Do not like: 

* **Name of the Wind** As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.
* **Monster hunter international** Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.
* Tried **The Malazan Book of the Fallen**: just couldn't get into the story.
* And all my friends keep begging me to give the **Dark Tower Series** another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.

The gay panic defense is a legal defense, usually against charges of assault or murder. A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent temporary insanity because of a purported psychiatric condition called homosexual panic. The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.

Trans panic is a similar defense applied towards cases where the victim is a transgender or intersex person.

4152,2016,2,czj4ho2,,AskReddit,1458208487,0,0,0,"No, you seriously aren't understanding what mainstream Muslims believe and I don't blame you, many people on the Internet share this naive and sophomoric view of Islamic doctrine. Most Muslims do not get their religious knowledge from the Quran, in terms of what Muslims practice, the Quran has little to do with it. The fact is that most Muslims do not read the translation of the Quran and even if they did, it's not easily understood without some hadith to support it and give it context like what conditions it must be followed in etc. This is why most Muslims rely on hadith and teachings that are passed down, hadith is much simpler to understand and that's what most Muslims follow. Most Muslims agree that the Quran itself is not enough to understand and practice Islam and even the hadith can be slightly problematic in terms of reliability and contradictions. This is why they rely on fiqh, the four schools of thought hanafi, hanbali, maliki and shafi have simplified the teachings into reliability and made rulings on what's permissable or not permissable. All sunni Muslims follow one of the four schools of thought, except the people who identify as just sunni as sunni means a follower of the sunnah and sunnah is the way of Muhammad. There are slight disagreements between the four fiqhs but generally they're close and they aren't really regarded as wrong by other schools of thought. The problem with contemporary issues is that scholars and imams make rulings based on implications e.g TV being wrong, cartoons, etc. This is one of the reasons why some Muslims say certain things are prohibited whilst doing other things. Again, what Muslims do and do not follow is heavily based on culture. A hanafi Muslim in UK who follows his religion is very different from a hanafi Muslim in Pakistan. They both follow the same school of thought but it's society and culture which influences the lifestyle. There's also not a lot to ""remove"" half the things in the Quran that seem violent go along with the context of hadith, some other things have been examined by the fiqh and contemporary scholars and by cross referencing hadith, the verses have been redefined. E.g there's an importance of God's law which must be followed, then there's hadith saying sharia law for you living in a non Muslim country is to follow the laws of the land. ",,,,,,,,,

&gt; &amp;quot;While we&amp;#039;ve gone on hunger strike purely in solidarity with the Palestinian political prisoners, we hope it increases pressure on the university to comply with our demands.""

&gt; Speaking to Al Jazeera, he praised the actions of the students as &amp;quot;Courageous&amp;quot; and criticised the university for using &amp;quot;Intimidation&amp;quot; tactics against the students being disciplined for the March protest.

4277,2017,5,dgz1aj1,,Bitcoin,1496157777,0,0,0,"Proudhon's phrase ""property is theft"" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property.

If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that *anything* was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism.

Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:

&gt; Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint.  
For the moment, he is still drinking beer,  
Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water.  
When others cry savagely ""down with the kings""  
Stirner immediately supplements ""down with the laws also.""  
Stirner full of dignity proclaims;  
You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free.  
You become accustomed to slavery  
Down with dogmatism, down with law.  
  
Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give *indirect* platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ).

I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the *least* keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - 1) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and 2) It's ability to distribute consensus has *so much more* potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth). So much so that I imagine almost any modern anarcho-*communist* society would also want base their communications upon it.",,,,,,,,,

I walked in one blustery MLK day a few years back after leaving what I thought was a jazz concert but wasn't, in the theater on 92nd &amp; caught a great piano, bass &amp; drum trio. I was on a 1st date, there was no 2nd, so I humbly asked to sit in. The pianist graciously agreed &amp; we settled on Miles' ""Four"". 


Then the pianist picked up a trumpet &amp; the drummer counted off at an insane tempo. I get it, see if the new kid can keep up. I did, praise God, &amp; they were very cool, asked if I wanted to do another but it was time to go so I promised I'd be back. 


All in all, a fun time and world class players, to be sure. Plying my trade in Palm Beach these days. Love NYC, hate winter. There are a number of jazz venues down here but not like up north. I'm excited to see Joey DeFrancesco next month in Ft. Lauderdale. 


I recently picked up a 1946 Hammond CV &amp; am studying with Tony Monaco via Skype. Whoever tells you, piano/organ, same thing, all keys, doesn't have a clue. Playing Jimmy Smith style requires bass lines in LH leaving only 5 fingers to make the changes. As a pianist for over 1/2 century, standard MO is splitting chord tones between RH/LH, I'm going insane attempting to visualize chords voiced 100% differently.


For the most part I keep my root-7 in the LH on piano using RH for the color tones. On Hammond, I play the color tones in RH but 3-7 is missing. Inserting them in the bass line isn't the same thing. A truly humbling experience but Tony is on a 3-4 week Asian tour &amp; I'm working on ""Song For My Father"". Really digging ""Groove"" Hoimes' version, as Tony's, Joey's &amp; others. If you know of any other hip Hammond versions, turn me on to them, please.

By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers and the younger sons of baronets, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession, and thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. In this sense, the word equates with the French gentilhomme (""nobleman""), which latter term has been, in Great Britain, long confined to the peerage. Maurice Keen points to the category of ""gentlemen"" in this context as thus constituting ""the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France"".

I got the VIP ticket and we have an early access to the place along with Q&amp;A session with her, some merch and a pre-show/soundcheck. But she became sick 2 days before the concert and lost her voice so she canceled her shows for NY and Cleveland. I won passes for a pizza party with her at a radio station but I was told it was canceled due to her condition. I thought the concert was canceled as well, then around 1pm I realized nobody has emailed me about the cancelation and started freaking out. My only transportation there is a train ride that goes for 1hr and 20min, and the VIP ticket holders have to be there by 4 or we'll miss the whole program set for us. I got there around 5:30, I was crying in the train on the way there too. I went in and told them I'm a VIP and the lady named Victoria was the one who gave me my ticket and merch. She told me to wait for a few minutes and she'll be back. She came back and told me to follow her, she asked why I was late and I told her everything. She also told me how Alessia's been feeling and that they didn't do the soundcheck to preserve her voice for the show tonight. She then followed up with ""so, how about a private, one-on-one meet and greet with her?"" in my head I started freaking out and she took me to her dressing room. It was the craziest thing ever. When she came up the first words that came out of my mouth were ""are you okay? How are you?"" all she can do was mouth the words ""yeah, I'm doing okay. Hopefully I can sing tonight"". I gave her my gift, took pics with her and have her signed some stuff. She's the sweetest and most down to earth famous person I've ever met. She then hugged me and said ""I hope to see you out there"". A few minutes after I left she then tweeted and DMed me on Twitter. That was just insane.

The main difference is economy of scale. There are many dishes that I would use 3 separate pans for in a kitchen but only 1 for at home to save time on cleanup and be able to multi task easier. The same with industrial ovens, dozens of knives (although you still use a chef's knife for 95% of things), etc.

Plating and decoration make food look better even when it's not, I usually skip that at home but the food's the same quality.

Ingredient selection is definitely hampered at home, without wholesale prices and the guarantee that I'll use expensive things before they expire, but that's something that can be partially avoided with planning, or just tolerated if I really want to make a knockout dish.

To reiterate, I think one-mindedness comes from being in power for a long time. I believe the as more time passes the Republicans will eventually conform around specific goals and work rather cohesively. That may be around the WH or it may not. It kind of depends on what their constituents want.

I know that the RNC has many fractions. What I'm saying very bluntly is that if they can't figure out those fractions is screwed because then they'll accomplish nothing and lose power.

The reason why comparing the RNC to the DNC isn't false equivalency, in summary, is because they were ""hired"" to a do the same job; run the country.

The the RNC can't figure out a way to do that effectively then they're not doing their jobs and people who vote R will become and should become pissed off.

As for Trump, he needs to keep campaigning on it. He should keep on message and repeating that message until the job gets done. 

Without that focus and effort the RNC gets to fight among itself and get nothing done.

Just imagine that Trump laid down a clear idea of what Trumpcare was, what you would get and why it was better. Not just Obamacare sucks but ""this is my plan. This is why it's better.""

Trump won the election. If he could get enough of the R electorate on his side the Senate/House would be forced to follow.

4391,2016,2,czje58x,,AskReddit,1458213106,0,5,0,"False. There is a very good reason for it's reclassification.

Pluto is just one of many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).

When Pluto was discovered and classified as a planet, we didn't know that these other very similar and very close together bodies existed.

If we classify Pluto as a planet, then we have to classify many (or all) of the other KBOs as planets to avoid arbitrarily picking just one or two of them and calling them planets.

And since we're letting the Kuiper Belt Objects in on the planetary action, we'd be forced to look at the Asteroid Belt again. The same process that happened with Pluto and the other KBOs *already happened* with Ceres and the other Asteroids in the 19th century. The first few Asteroids were considered planets until we realized there's tons of them, and they all far more resemble each other than they do planets. 

If we count all of them then we're left with a mess of hundreds or thousands of planets. So instead of that, the IAU decided to follow prior precedent, and Pluto and the other KBOs went the way of the Asteroids. Unlike the KBOs and Asteroids, the 8 planets are all *unique.*",,,,,,,,,

That's an overkill. You don't have to do that. As long as you still got your shit together and are midly interesting, you can still get that ""dream woman"". 

Just remember though that you're chasing after something that is the absolute best fit for you. It isn't impossible, but you're shrinking your dating pool.

&gt;Everyone around my says I'm not that old yet and how I have plenty of time. but you fucking know what? The ones that all say that met their partners when they were low to mid 20's. Not one of those fuckers met them after 30. Not fucking one yet they all tell my I'm not too old. 

Come on they're trying to make you feel better and you're being an ass about it. They can't tell you about dating after the age of 30 so they tell you what they know. Again, you're not too old

&gt;Fuck you, I'm ancient when it comes to dating these days. I'm fucked.

I figured out a way to prove i wasn't smurfing.  Feel free to pause the gif at any time to see what I'm talking about. First, on the bottom left, you see my name is ""Musty"". Next, I pull up overwolf which shows my ranks. It correctly displays my 1100+ unranked mmr and champ 3+ ranks in every playlist which corresponds with my [rocketleaguetracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/amustycow) ranks. Make sure you look at the last part of my steam ID on rocketleagueracker. It's the same name as my reddit account. Next, I shift+tab to pull up the steam menu which shows my recent games. You may need to pause here. It shows that I played someone named ""Maze"" 1 day ago which corresponds with the name of my opponent in the post. You can also see that I have 43 friends online. I don't know many people that have 43 friends on a smurf, let alone all of them being online. The next scene shows that I have 581 hours on record. (I moved from xbox 3 months ago and had around 1700 hours on xbox.) Also, it shows i have 91 hours in the past 2 weeks. That's over 6 hours a day. I don't know many people that have that amount of playtime on a smurf. Also in this scene you can see the end of my steam profile which corresponds with both my reddit username and my [rocketleaguetracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/amustycow) url

&gt; Unless their anecdote included how they came to there conclusion, then there is nothing for me to consider, there is nothing to analyze. If they are right, there should be a way for me to come to the same conclusion on my own. If they are wrong and I trust that information, I may have to restart the entire Sudoku, as I likely would not likely remember every superjacent choice I made based on that wrong information. 

Well, actually, their anecdote does contain something for you to consider: they claim they did/finished the sudoku, right? That means that if their answer was correct, they should have gotten no inconsistencies, leading you to believe that their placement of the 9 was possibly/probably correct. Unless you interpret their statement of ""I did the sudoku earlier"" to *not* include ""I finished the sudoku earlier, with no inconsistencies"".

On the other hand, if I listened to your friend (somewhere along the way, I decided he's your friend eventhough, looking back, you never specified that. but it's easier to reference this way, so I will continue with it) and put a 9 there, would I necessarily be a fool at that point? Remember that we live within a timeline that we have no control over; I *can't* know whether the 9 truly goes there or not until after I've finished the puzzle. After the puzzle is complete, I'll be able to know the truth, *whether I trusted your friend or not* (because this is incorporates an exhaustive example, unlike with the bathroom thing where failing to see the bathroom could prompt the people to keep saying ""it's further back"" or ""you just missed it"" or something else), but at the very point where I listen to your friend and put the 9 in the box while you don't listen to your friend and refuse to put the 9 in the box, neither you nor I can possibly know whether it is correct or not. But the point of listening isn't to know whether he is correct or not; it's to decide whether it's a potentially good idea to act on the information or not.

(realistically, I like solving sudoku on my own, so I would actually get annoyed if someone told me ""put a 9 there"" and I probably wouldn't be one to listen. Not because I distrust them, but because ""it's *my* game that I'm playing"")

And if you set the standard super high to the point where you don't trust anyone else, does that still mean nobody else is allowed to trust anyone else? What about teachers? If I take a math class and my teacher tells me that 2+2=4, am I allowed to trust the teacher prior to ""solving the proof"" for myself? (solving the proof being different from just getting the answer, as mathematically solving the proof means working out all of the underlying mechanics of *how/why* 2 plus 2 equals 4, which is actually a bit more difficult than intuitively putting two objects with two other objects and claiming its now a group of four objects. http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/as2446/224.pdf as an example of exactly that proof. That kind of proving isn't taught in grade 1 where we learn 2+2=4, so we necessarily trust the teacher when they teach us a system that we haven't verified for ourselves yet. As a further aside, this pure mathematical proving falls under Rationalism, knowledge gained purely from thought alone, rather than Empiricism, knowledge gained through sensory observation. Knowledge gained through Rationalism is actually considered stronger in terms of ""truthiness"" compared to Empiricism, but only so long as it rests on Deductive Reasoning as only Deductive Reasoning can provide true conclusions so long as the premises are true. Inductive Reasoning and Abductive Reasoning cannot give true conclusions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wrCpLJ1XAw&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR&amp;index=3 for that reference)

&gt; If you are going to be making a choice of any importance, you need to be able to verify the information you are given. I would only act on unverified information as an act of desperation, if forced to make a choice with no other information to act on.

I don't think that's the case at all. Going back to the washroom example, if a bunch of people all told you ""we saw a washroom around the corner"", then ""you going to see for yourself whether there is a washroom there"" is itself the ""acting on unverified information"" as you act *to* verify it.

In the sudoku example, you continuing on with the sudoku is a form of verification because eventually you will learn for yourself whether the 9 goes there or not, but you set it up so that your verification there is simply from ignoring what your friend had to say and working it out for yourself. I, on the other hand, listened to what your friend had to say and worked it out from there; if your friend is right then I will have no inconsistencies, whereas if your friend is wrong then I will have an inconsistency prior to finishing the puzzle (unless I make a mistake. But then, even though you didn't listen to your friend, you could still make a mistake too, so that's a negligible thing).

&gt; An anecdote could be a lie, or simple misremembering. While there may be no reason to assume an anecdote is false, there is also no reason to assume an anecdote is true. 

And you don't have to assume the anecdote is true. The anecdote is simply someone's claim about something they observed. It's a *reason* to believe that they *could* be right, not that they *necessarily are* right.

&gt; Any confirmable data, no matter how minor, is better to go on that any amount of anecdotes, no matter how great.

The anecdotes lead you in the direction of verification. The anecdotes themselves are not the verification. Just like any other evidence; evidence points towards the truth of the larger picture but it not *itself* the truth of the larger picture.

Say you walk around a building and see two cars in the street at odd angles, one of the doors smashed in on one car, and the front bender smashed in on the other car: these are all observations of pieces of data that you could try to piece together yourself, but those pieces themselves are not the full story of the truth of what happened and you use a lot of guesswork as glue to put them together. If someone else comes along and claims ""I saw the car crash. That car there hit that car there"" then their story is not the full story of the truth of what happened either. Each piece is a truth *in its own right*, but in regards to the larger story, each piece is just part of a larger puzzle that we try to piece together. Anecdotes, which is to say other peoples' claims of their observations, are just like your own personal observations in that they are just pieces of the puzzle.

And in the car crash, the only way to *certainly* know what happened, would be to watch it yourself; anything less, including watching a video of the crash right after the video was taken, is merely trusting another source; and thus we get into primary sources versus secondary sources (maybe I should have gone this route earlier). You are a primary source of anything you directly observe or think or feel. [EDIT]But everyone else is a also primary source of their own thoughts and feelings and observations of events[/EDIT]. Sure it's better to get as close to a primary source as possible to the point where ""you being a primary source"" is the best possible scenario, but sometimes we just plain can't get close to a primary or even secondary source, such as in the case of history from thousands of years ago.

EDIT: Physical recordings are also considered primary sources so long as they either directly record the event, in the case of video, or are created by people who are primary sources, ie an eye-witness account.

EDIT 2: for more on primary and secondary sources https://library.ithaca.edu/sp/subjects/primary and http://www.uvic.ca/library/research/tips/primvsec/index.php

EDIT 3: Or maybe I should take the angle of reversing the roles of a scenario. Someone comes up to you and asks where the bathroom is, and since you just used the bathroom, you can tell them ""it's right around the corner"". Or, you just finished a sudoku and your friend is having a hard time of the exact same one (what are the odds!) so you decide to help him out by giving him a hint: ""9 goes in that square"".",,,,,,,,,

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

4755,2017,8,dkztj8y,,CasualConversation,1503657430,0,0,0,"Socialism is a *very* broad idea about social ownership with many different ways for that to be implemented. The nature of which is very compatible with democracies and capitalism. Hence why pretty much every industrialized nation has many elements of socialism. The US is frequently criticized for having fewer social programs than the other OECD nations, particularly for its general lack of a socialized healthcare system (except medicaid, medicare, and the veteran programs).

Communism is more specific and while it has multiple definition itself, it usually involves seizing (not ceasing, haha) the means of production (and ""the means of production"" also varies by definition). Communism tries to outright remove social classes and typically requires a great upheaval of society (although communist thinkers are somewhat divided on whether or not outright revolution is necessary for the transformation into a communist society). And while we're breaking misconceptions, communism doesn't require that every is paid the same or the likes.

In practice, communism has tended to result in dictators. Probably in part because of the common idea that a powerful, small, transitional government would be needed to facilitate the massive upheaval, and that tends to favor someone rising as a dictator. Not to mention the fact that communism appeals to the working class, making it a rallying cry. Socialism, on the other hand, in practice tends to be used mostly by democracies and is a principle tool of modern liberalism, which heavily favours welfare systems, which are a socialistic idea. Perhaps a common area for confusion is how many communist governments have put ""socialist"" somewhere in their name. But they also like to call themselves ""democratic"" and ""republic"", so you really shouldn't put much weight in names!",,,,,,,,,

So they get distracted by Netflix and Marvel Movies and all other sorts of low-impact information. It's a *Brave New World* sort of argument, I guess. There's too much information out there for any one person to sift through, so they just don't bother. As you say, if they ever need it, they just ask Siri, why bother paying attention? 

OR they do, but they focus on simple, high-emotion stories and ignore the complex underlying mechanisms and laws at work. They don't need to know about that, they just need to get outraged and demand that something be done. In lieu of building a better world (which takes effort and a solid understanding of reality) they complain about the world they got and hope somebody else fixes it.

Take, for instance, this whole hullabaloo around the Fine Brothers, rather than targeting the underlying IP system that enables them to even do what they're doing.

The nice thing is that the internet has the ability to teach you good information AND the tools to make use of such information for your own advancement. I try to make this sub such a place. But you have to have some level of underlying intelligence to bootstrap into rational thinking.

Then, you run it into the uplink port on a normal WiFi router to serve your computers, phones, etc. If you're getting 300 m range there's probably a rooftop outdoor antenna serving that part of campus, so you could point a dish at that. The Ubiquiti devices have a built-in strength monitor that you can see on your laptop while you assist them.

However, that model would only work if they have 5 GHz support at your campus, and it might be wishful thinking to get a5 GHz signal from a sector antenna from that far away. There are also 2.4 GHz options, which would be somewhat bigger and probably more expensive.

Storage Pool

A storage pool can consist of heterogeneous physical disks. Notice that a physical drive in the context of Windows Server 2012 Storage Space is simply raw storage from a variety of types of drives including USB, SATA, and SAS drives as well as an attached VHD/VHDX file as shown below. With a storage pool, Windows Server 2012 presents the included physical drives as one logical entity. The allocating the capacity of a storage pool is to first create a virtual disk based on the storage pool followed by creating and mapping a volume Later a drive letter or an empty folder. And with the mapping, the volume based on a virtual disk of a storage pool will appear and work just like a conventional hard drive or folder in Windows Explorer.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies.",,,,,,,,,

I mostly agree.  

Also, obviously, Trump IS a bit over the top in his actions, but what better choice is there?  

Hilary, with her lies and political dicksuckery?  

Jeb, with his turtles and guac?  

Bernie, with his unrealistic pipe dream liberal-land promises?  

Who else is a realistic candicate?  

This is why I say that Trump seems to be the top candidate.  

I like how you said that 'people couldn't handle weed'.  I agree wholeheartedly.  The government has a responsability to sway people to do certain things, as to not harm themselves or everyone else, or cause harm by inaction.  

I feel like a president is someone that knows many people, knows how the world works, and knows what is best for the people, kind of like a good, stern parent.  

Hilary seems to be an absentminded soccer mom sipping on her frappe, Jeb seems like an autistic kid obcessed with turtles and guac, and Bernie seems to be a pothead that thinks 'love is all you need man', thinking that people have the ability to have self-control and provide their justified part in the system as a whole.  

Trump knows what's best for the nation, at least on the economics side of it, which is likely the single largest point of focus for the US, moving through the years when the EU dissolves, China falls, and mass refugee problems are abundant.  

I enjoyed your opinions, and will upvote you due to your honest, and thoughtful POV without namecalling and booing.

I have been fortunate though to play in a very good off-season comp. All teams consist of players in the highest tier of grades so the games are just as hard, if not harder, than winter season.

The other benefit of playing off-season is it helps to maintain game fitness.  May not be the same as your off-season comp but I would recommend giving it a shot!

As for stick skills, I know plenty of players who will focus on tapping the ball at the end of their stick and practice dribbling skills in the backyard. Hard to do much if you don't have much room but these basics will help with hand-eye coordination and to speed up basic skills.",,,,,,,,,

KLab does not have an obligation to give us better rates or even free stuff for that matter- but they choose to give us a ton of free stuff.

Mine may not be the most exciting experience, but its one of the very few that I have experienced that I 100% believe was paranormal.  

 I was in the church that was supposed to be haunted, and after sitting there quietly we (a group of about 4) began to hear what sounded like footsteps. At first I just rationalized it as the church settling or whatnot but it really did sound like heavy footsteps, even with a sort of heel-to-toe sound. So I sat in the middle of the aisle where I had been hearing them and you could hear the footsteps walk away from me and towards me.

According to the [wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Warframe) warframes were, at one point, referred to as ""exo-armor"" (although that seems to have been removed now), meaning that there is indeed something inside the suit, that needs protecting. Could very well be that all warframes are a combination of Orokin soldier stuck inside the frame and Tenno operator controlling it. Which could potentially make the Stalker a 'frame that gained independence from its operator. 

If it's indeed an Orokin Soldier/Tenno Operator combination that would also explain why the Stalker, who'd be one of such soldiers, is hell-bent on avenging the fallen Orokin empire. He watched the Tenno destroy the Empire, unable to do anything against it, because his own Operator kept him under control - and now he wants revenge.

You really think crow and duke is much of a running formation?  Maybe in the pre 1970s.  Now they will play a big nickel on you. You will have a SS flying into duke on runs. How long will he last taking those hits? 


The patriots noticed the best coverage people on the defense were corners. They took advantage of that by playing 2 TEs or a strong slot wr as the 3rd wr.  The best 2 defenders were on the wide outs.  

By going 2-2, you are basically freeing up one of the better coverage defenders to take away you second best receiver which could be duke or Njoku. Crow basically is a blocker or dump off on pass plays. On runs, you at a disadvantage.  The defense will be playing pass and not afraid of the run because they know a LB or Safety can beat the block by the other RB. Crow doesn't block blitzes very well as it is. Thinking he will lead duke on runs is optimistic. 

Look, I'm not saying we can't go 2-2 a few plays a game. But that is not something you should be a major part of the offense.

Would you rather have Nestle managing the water supply in your area, or a bunch of socialists?

Judging by your spelling, you're likely somewhere that's more socialist than the United States.

We're also coming at this from different perspectives. You're assuming sexist advice is always bad advice. When colleges and courts and the news don't assume by default that men are rapists waiting to pounce, then advice telling men to avoid being caught with their pants metaphorically or literally down in situations that put them in a bad light, even and especially if they are innocent will be meaningless. Until then, I think it's pretty solid advice.

Besides, if we're talking about rejecting reality, your proposed solution seems to be ""hope things will work out for the best and that no one will screw you over because they maybe won't.""

The problem with them is they share base damage values and %scaling with mages, instead of you know, doing less damage because they're tanks. The justification for this is that supports tend to be behind due to xp and leveling. So what's the obvious answer to these problems? nerf base damage values and change how proximity xp/gold is given, thus putting not only supports, but junglers in a better place to teamfight? No, nerf cooldown, nerf armor and health values, and nerf select CC gods while leaving other problematic ones untouched. It just really really confuses me that they'd absolutely destroy their set meta that was so close to being balance outside of a few problem gods, and instead completely destroy the balance of the game to try something that seems to not be working for the most part. Jungle now seems like a lane partner instead of a ganker, supports end up roaming far more often in order to get more xp to stay relevant, and most god options for jungle have been severely reduced to a key few that offer the instant burst of damage needed to kill someone, then quickly return to your lane partner mid. The entire meta so far just seems like incredible backtrack to s1 early s2 which is what we spent all of s2 trying to get away from.",,,,,,,,,

The problem is that we don't have any evidence that human beings innately possess some type of similar moral code, or that the universe has a moral code.

So in the State of Nature there's no such thing as ""murder"" there is just intentional killing. Murder is a dangerous word for you to throw around by the way, because it has a component of being illegal, and it assumes or implies a wrongful or morally wrong killing. So using the word is sort of like begging the question.

If Sam has a banana farm and George wants the banana farm, in the State of Nature where there is no prior agreement or understanding between the two, of course George can take the banana farm. He should probably kill or enslave Sam while doing so because leaving Sam free after taking the banana farm will likely lead Sam to try to kill George while he sleeps and take back the banana farm.

Murder is wrong in our society and to me, but in your hypothetical situation where there is just Sam and George and a banana farm there is no such thing as murder, and George killing Sam for it is neither right nor wrong. We can have a debate about whether it is the optimal decision, but we'd need a more complex scenario.",,,,,,,,,

I'll not soon forget a night in the early '80's, not longer after I graduated from high school, when a friend of mine was visiting after having spent some time in England. We were out in a bar, and he asked me for a cigarette using British vernacular, ""Would you spot me fag old chap?"" I swear, ice cubes stopped falling in mid air.

There's not a lot of diversity in the area. That lack of diversity, as a matter of course, leads to some attitudes and prejudices that are difficult to overcome. Those attitudes and prejudices are obvious to anyone who has spent a significant part of their lives living elsewhere. I do have nuanced discussions with some of my classmates, but all of those friends did spend a good part of their lives living outside the Green Bay area. This isn't a lack of education. It's a lack of experience.

The point isn't to just rag on these people. Indeed, the vast majority of them are good, kind-hearted people even if they are a bit anti-intellectual. Rather, as I mentioned in my earlier reply, this does speak to the basic question of the presumption of innocence. How can there be a presumption of innocence in a society where people are quick to judge and given to many prejudices that are, more often than not, fueled by rumor and gossip?

A player who puts all his points into Strength and Vitality plays significantly different than one who puts his points into Bloodtinge and Arcane. The former is built to get up in someone's face and trade hits with something like the Kirkhammer, while the latter has traded durability and melee power for much stronger guns and access to magic items.
&gt; And while you could theoretically max out all your stats in Bloodborne, it'd take far beyond the normal playtime to do it. In a normal playthrough, you don't come close to a fully maxed out character.

The different roles just determine your starting points which can be changed later but okay.


&gt;This actually brings up a really interesting topic. Most JRPGs aren't RPGs. It's the reason the term ""JRPG"" is so divisive; they really contain very little role-playing. The first ones, like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, were aping D&amp;D on limited technology and have more in common with traditional RPGs. They quickly veered off into their own style, though. One that concentrated more on stories with defined characters instead of the player freedom that gives rise to role-playing.
If I had to rename them, I'd actually call the genre ""narrative adventure."" Obviously that's not going to happen, but I feel like this is why JRPGs have become one of those things where it's hard to define, but ""I'll know it when I see it."" They retain a few superfluous elements of D&amp;D but abandoned the underlying purpose of tabletop games where ""RPG"" was coined.
I mean, I like JRPGs. I just accept that their genre name is something of a misnomer.

What about Witcher 3? There's no role. You're just geralt...a plain old Witcher.

I think the term RPG has evolved to mean some thing quite different from what it once meant.",,,,,,,,,

If something is loose or a wire has come un-done and is shorting itself it could definitely be a culprit. Unfortunately this requires going in and checking *everything*. Best to use a multimeter or dummy light. 

A bad alternator or battery would explain the symptoms. Testing an alternator in a car is tricky, it's not always going to give you a correct answer. If you have the money, you can swap a new cheapo battery into it and see if the problem persists. I had a guy tell me an alternator was bad when it was really just the battery.

Lastly (and this is a shot in the dark tbh) if your timing belt tensioner isn't pulling the belt tight enough it won't turn the A/C compressor or the alternator. I doubt that's the problem but I've seen it happen before (and you'd be seeing other symptoms)

5476,2016,2,czjeehq,,Gender_Critical,1458213228,0,0,0,"I agree with Astraloid that the industry is driven by misogyny. I believe very strongly that the reason so many people are into BDSM and their particular kinks within it is because we are socialized in this society to view and glorify sex as an act of violence and degradation perpetrated on a passive partner, usually a woman. Particularly within the BDSM world you can see a massive overlap between male sexual submission and sissification, crossdressing, forced feminization etc. where dominatrices, for instance, rarely dress as men. I engage in BDSM and believe that experience at times to be cathartic (get all that messed up gender socialization out of the way in fantasy land and then revert to having to consciously push against it all day long in the real world, which is exhausting).

For a woman with a true fetish i.e. she cannot orgasm without at least fantasizing about submission/BDSM, because she internalized a lot of sexually violent and damaging gender messages in early childhood, possibly was a victim of sexual abuse - do we expect her to never have an orgasm for the sake of political correctness? Certainly we need to be helping women understand these effects. As women, our sexuality is attacked and stilted by our upbringing. Culture and my environment may have shaped my sexual psyche in an unhealthy, undesirable way, but after coming to terms with that and trying for a long time to change it I find I can't, and I find myself unwilling to deny myself one of the few pleasures life provides.

This is not the level of self-awareness with which most people in ""the scene"" and certainly not at mainstream production companies/professional dungeons are operating. I personally would LOVE to see a whole lot more time dedicated to the discussion of the psychologically safe practice of BDSM.",,,,,,,,,

Ok we just got this place and in the basement there is a bathroom with a toilet , sink and shower. Also there is a laundry sink nearby. 
In the basement there is a waste pump, or sump pump. 
The issue is whenever the pump runs, it causes the bathroom sink (and a few moments later the laundry sink) to gargle or bubble. Occasionally it releases a bit of a smell as well. 
The previous owner installed the air access valve you see in the picture under the bathroom sink. it seems to work (as in, it allows air in but not out) when I test it, but it doesn't fix the issue.
I have read that an air valve like that needs to be 6"" above the trap, so do you think that's the issue?
Or could it be something else entirely?
Any help figure this out is appreciated.

5551,2017,8,dkztfwa,,Cloud9,1503657384,0,0,0,"Riot has a theory of acquiring funding (like coke sponsoring their events) and doing all the legwork themselves and hiring everyone where valve works the opposite, they prefer(ed) to fund themselves and then delegate all the work themselves.

Keep in mind valve is a billion dollar company with like 250 employees. They don't hire esports people whatsoever.

For the last two years valve funded 5 majors (3 million dollar prize) and two TI's (20 and 23 million dollars), with the intention of letting the rest of the year play out organically.  

Any online league that exists (I know of two legitimate ones, Dreamleague ran by dreamhack, which is a small 8 team league with a 4 team lan final) and Prodota (kinda like a self-organized Challenger Series with tier 2/tier3 teams). 

It's a lot like CSGO this next year where there will be tournament organizers hosting their own things, and valve has a new idea to just give money to organizers who host 500k prizepool events (doubing the prize pool) and calling them majors, and rewarding players for attending by giving them points. Minors also will occur allowing players to earn points at lesser events, valve will again double the prizepool if it's over 150,000$ (300k)

So next year the system is different and the SOLE FACTOR for determining the invitations to TI8 (Next year's ti) is these new major/minor points. The only other way to reach majors/ti is the same way to reach any event, qualify online.

But again, there still will be relatively zero league-play for top teams, league play like NALCS or ESL Pro League doesn't really happen in dota at all. ",,,,,,,,,

Second, watch the getting started videos on iRacings Youtube page. Some of these are out of date a bit, but still helpful nonetheless.

Third, read the sporting code once you become a member. This will cover everything.

&gt; Best deal

There are a few new member deals floating around. A couple are listed over in the sidebar here ---&gt; Not sure if any are still active though.

&gt; how not to anger people as a new driver

Practice a lot before you race and treat people as you would want to be treated. Ill just say that you already have a big leg up on many new drivers in that you understand the simple concept of empathy. Some people just drive like there arent other humans in the other cars.

In terms of practice time, it depends on how skilled you are. Do you have any background at all in sim racing or is iRacing your first venture into this world? Do you have any background in understanding motorsports in general. Do you watch racing? Do you understand racing concepts (drafting, cornering, apex, etc)? If you answered no to any of these questions, you might need to spend more time than others educating yourself. On the other hand If you have plenty of prior experience and knowledge, getting competent wont take too long. Getting fast though takes awhile. For example, I had a long history with sim racing games from the time I was a young kid and it took me close to a year to really get competitive with the fastest guys. iRacing is like nothing else out there.

&gt; how to get set-ups

1. Make your own

2. Some people share theirs on the forum, you can download from there.

3. [SetupSync](http://iracingsetupsync.nickthissen.nl/). A wonderful application made by a fellow member for sharing and downloading setups. There are thousands of setups available on there for most any car/track combo.",,,,,,,,,

Fair enough. He's been pretty open that he's doing that so China will cooperate on North Korea, though. I support him flip-flopping.

Trade war? We're losing $500 billion in trade with China. Who the hell cares if there's a trade war?”

You offered to give sources, so I'd like to see sources on him ""flip-flopping"" on any of these things. As far as I know, he never promised to not take calls from Taiwan. 

&gt;On intervention in Syria, another reversal. NATO's also suddenly not obsolete anymore.

5650,2017,8,dkzvj5y,,AskReddit,1503658404,0,0,0,"Yeah! I have had these same two for many years. They are what I use daily, sometimes 6-8 hours in a stretch. They are both Singers. The lightweight is a 20u, which is a zigzag and straight stitch. The heavy duty is a 531b, which is straight stitch only. I believe Consew has a model just like the 531b; i think the singer was actually made by consew. I bought them both used, and just make sure to take them to the machine spa for their tune up regularly. They are FAST, which is why I love them. The lightweight is only light compared to the heavy duty (I call him The Beast) because it can sew through multiple layers of vinyl or canvas. The Beast, I am convinced, would sew through a finger, though I've yet to test that theory. 
It's been a while since I bought them, but if I remember correctly, I paid about $600 for Beast, and maybe $3-600 for The Little One?  I found her on Craigslist, and drove about an hour to pick her up. They are crazy heavy, as the motor is attached to the table, and you just pull the machine head off and take that part to the repair shop. I've had these two for so long, they feel like an extension of my hands :). 

If you have a sewing machine shop anywhere near you, go in and try some out. If you don't, keep an eye on Craigslist and go visit it. Don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't feel like the right machine for you. They are great machines, but I walked away from one because it hadn't been cared for and it wasn't worth the risk to me. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm actually sitting with The Little One right now, working on a quilt at night. Let me know if you have any other questions! ",,,,,,,,,

Lentils - $.99/lb (lasts for probably 12 meals)

It's hard to watch, yes. It depicts true evil and savagery that actually occurred. It shows you just how dark the world can be and how cruel humanity can become 

But it's also a story of hope. In the midst of all the carnage, death, torture, and more is a gambling, alcoholic, womanizing, slave-labor/war profiteering Nazi.

This deeply flawed man, who by all accounts represents the worst in humanity, changes who he is and becomes one of the most remarkable heroes of one of the darkest chapters in human history. If it were fictional we'd call it out as outlandish.

The film simultaneously horrifies you with the depth of humanity's potential for evil, and restores your faith in the redemption of a man who saved thousands through self-sacrifice and ingenuity.

The darkness of the film juxtaposed against the greatness of Schindler's actions makes for a film that gives me a weird sense of hope within the chaos.",,,,,,,,,

But I really learned to dislike media between 2016-2017. They could really put a stupid magnifying glass on any event, and create a big deal out of a non-issue - and it really put a bad taste in my mouth. If they spent 10 minutes on the thing and moved on, nothing would have come of it. But they knew that if the spent hours on this stupid thing, it would rile up enough rednecks and boost their ratings. 

One thing I love about sports is getting into all the media hype, the rivalries, the stats, and personal stories. Etc. It's sounds stupid, and it probably is. But I think that attitude is true for the majority of americans. 

It was hard for me to get interested into NFL this season because of all that negativity surrounding it. ",,,,,,,,,

Starring Axel Hennie as Max Manus. He did a very good job depicting the psychological effect a war has on a person. Pretty sure im not alone shedding a tear at the end of the movie.

if it's ghost of kirin's PS3 videos, that's a lot easier to do on PS3 because of the terrible frame rate, meaning you have more leeway. at least for his frigor/comestation attacks. projectile attacks are ezpz to perfect block. the shield enchants you have also increase the leeway for perfect block as well.

5889,2016,2,czj6xea,,Mommit,1458209636,0,17,0,"This happened to me but nowhere as serious. I KNEW something would happen when I had my baby. I KNEW it from the moment I found out I was pregnant. 
I had two other children vaginally with no complications. 
I told my husband something was wrong. He was initially worried but after the first ultrasounds and exams went well he told me I was just stressing myself out for no reason.
It was so bad that I talked my doc into admitting me the night I was 39 weeks because I was already showing signs of early labor and knew something would happen. She honestly probably just did it to make me feel better. It couldn't hurt.
The next morning contractions are getting heavy, I'm dialated to 3 by 6am. I still am unbelievably anxious, Keep turning the babies heartrate monitors volume up. Then next thing I know the heartrate changes, my nurse comes in and starts monitoring it, then there are two nurse, then four. Then I'm being flipped. Next thing I know a nurse grabs my leg and goes over wrist deep into me without warning and an oxygen mask was slapped on. The nurse said ""Shit!! It's the cord!"" and my heart skipped a beat. Here it was.
The nurse with her hand up me jumped onto the bed and started shouting orders. Another nurse looked at me and asked if I had ever heard of a complete cord prolapse. All I said was lets go. They started running through the halls with my bed, and next thing I know I'm being told to hold my head back and there is a mask and then nothing. 
My baby barely made it. My doctor actually told me that had anyone done anything different my baby wouldn't have made it. A baby's heartrate in-utero is tachacardic at 120, hers was 60 when my surgery started.
She also told me that because of the placental postion that had it not been caught not only would the baby decending into the birth canal kill her, but would have caused my placenta to rupture and me to hemorrhage. 
Had I been home, chances are we both would've died.
9 hours after her birth after 6 hours on oxygen and constant monitoring she was finally able to come meet me.
Intuition is there for a reason.

Yeah the UFC gives Rockhold shit because he was a loyal Strikeforce guy, please note that I am not sating they market every attractive white dude but they have a type (like Sage and PVZ could be brother and sister).

Good thing DC didn't do that after the fight and didn't shy away from the Rogan interview either, even if it was difficult as hell.  It takes a strong man to do that in front of the camera, and that's not even considering the KO.  It's what Ronda didn't learn when she ran out of the cage after her loss.

As for letting himself get beat up when he is so strong, I think that was the point. He KNOWS that Sasuke did terrible things. And he knows he's still going to try to save him. All he can do is let her take out her anger and sadness on him. Because he understands what it's like to lose your master who you love.

Clonodine in my experience is very benign (meaning that it doesn't do shit for my anxiety, as I don't have an issue with sweats and shakes). They're two totally different mechanisms, but both will lower blood pressure and slow down your heart... but in prescribed small doses, if you're not combining with any other depressants (alcohol, etc), and otherwise healthy, I doubt you'd have anything major to worry about if your doses overlapped.

Some people love Clonodine for giving presentations, etc... They say anxiety meds are 60% placebo by nature. I say go with the mildest thing that helps you feel better! Good luck.",,,,,,,,,

6057,2017,8,dkzx8cv,,Animemes,1503659242,0,0,0,"Fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is. If you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you're also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would think it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person doesn't consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.

6100,2017,5,dgyv2hf,,AskReddit,1494516030,0,0,0,"There are pro's and con's to hiring practices like that.


Pro:

*  flexible staffing to meet demand for holidays.  The week of Christmas they need all hands on deck.  The week after Christmas they can let go of ALL probation employees so that their main staff can keep their hours.  There is no rule saying they need to keep all probation employees to the 80 day mark, they can always term a whole batch of them to keep the staffing levels appropriate for seasonal work.  I was termed the week after Thanksgiving because I would have hit my 90 day mark before Christmas.

*  you don't pay benefits, insurance, or have to cover their wages for unemployment claims.


*  it keeps the new hires competitive.  By constantly terming people it lets the others know that their head is on the chopping block if they call out sick or don't stay late or whatever.  Anecdotal, but I remember one day after working 9.5 hours I asked if I would be getting another break.  I still remember the look of disgust on the supervisors face at the idea that I deserved another break after working 4 hours straight.


Cons:


*  Typically it hurts morale among employees.  Costco has some kind of Teflon shield against this, probably because of how they treat their employees after they pass probation.


*  You end up having to eat a lot of training costs.  At my current job the average cost to hire one employee is ~$1,000.  So if I hire and term 10 people in a month that's $10,000 I'm eating in extra costs.  This toe of hiring tactic works best with low wage, low skill positions which is why Costco does it with their Box Boys (Front End Assistant).  They don't require much training beyond a few hours on the computer and they'll learn the rest on the job.


*  High turn over = lower efficiency.  The idea being someone that has worked there a year should be better at the job then someone that worked their a month.  I think customer service can suffer here too.



Sorry if that is more detailed than hat you were expecting, but it is something I've given a lot of thought to.  Again, I don't engage in this practice mostly due to my 2nd point on the con list, but also because I think it is morally wrong to offer someone a job while having no intention of keeping them.

There haven't been a ton of the surprise flashback cards released yet. For a vast majority of us, diamonds are incredibly rare. I have 96k in stubs stored up. I've completed most of the ""cheap"" epics. (Padres, Phillies, White Sox, Twins, A's) I got lucky and pulled a Marte so I finished the Pirates for Cutch (one of my favorite players) After I pulled Oh in a program pack, I went ahead and finished the Cardinals. (and Cepeda is a terrific talent BTW) 

Now I'm kind of just sitting and waiting. Freeman (who I bought planning to sell if he went diamond) is hitting so well for me, I think I may just lock him in soon. (not yet though, while I want to finish off all of the collections and epics at some point, I'd rather keep the 40k of stubs unlocked in case I need them. I have no use for McGriff or Heyward)  

Just be patient. Golds are going to start coming down first. Diamonds will follow. Last year Trout was 175 to 225K through the all star break. Shortly after he dipped to 125 and then 100. With all of the stubs SDS is allowing us to rack up this year, patience will greatly reward you.

6194,2017,5,dgyupk7,,KotakuInAction,1494515857,0,0,0,"I don't really have any opinion on if Call of Duty should have female soldiers in historical scenarios, because I'm not familiar enough with the series to know what it's going for or what its fans like or anything like that. (I can guess, but I'm not going to, that's weak arguing.)

Instead, I have a question. If the logic goes like this, ""Should this game have something that did not really happen in the original reality,"" and then ""Yes, because it's a fucking video game,"" then how does it matter? If the fact that it is ""just"" a video game means that we can have anything we want in it because it's all fake, then why does it matter what we have in it? At that point, it's just a silly plaything that should have no real effect on anything. Why would having women in it do anything in particular if it's ""just"" a video game?

I know usually the answer for that kind of argument is that it represents women and somehow empowers them, but my question is how does an object that is ""just"" something silly and transient empower or represent or help any part of society? Doesn't that require that we elevate the object in question above a pejorative ""just"" something that we can do anything we want to? Don't video games have to mean more to us than ""just"" a balloon or ""just"" a jalapeno or ""just"" a chair? Somewhere in the fantasy mustn't there be something worthwhile that elevates it above ""just a something,"" otherwise why should it matter? It's just pretend.

And if there is something in video games that make them more than ""just"" a video game where everything should be allowed if we whine hard enough, then it is no longer ""just"" a video game that can accomplish those needs because it's ""just"" a game and it is something different and at that point we can't just say anything goes because it is no longer this silly fantasy that can accommodate anything. 

That is, how is this not a contradiction? How can it be both so powerful that it can oppress women if it doesn't include them and so facile and ultimately unimportant that you can allow anything because it's ""just a game"" at the same time? Or is it that works of art and design, whether it be as simple as a recipe or as complex as a stage play have rules that are followed to make them aesthetically valuable and we cannot just throw out the rules and continue to maintain the same level of aesthetic value?

Eh, it depends on the system and its intended audience.  After the opening high-level description, dice mechanic may be the logical next thing to cover, or they may not.  More novel dice mechanic may warrant earlier placement.  In a very light game there may not be anything to put before the dice.  But  if your game's reason for existence is the setting, and it uses d20+mod, dice rolling can be safely pushed back.

TLDR:  this is not something to be dogmatic about.",,,,,,,,,

6209,2017,8,dkzpc6x,,AskReddit,1503655224,0,0,0,"The last time I went, just before I turned 21 and aged out of Medicare coverage.

I needed two cavities drilled and filled, and I wanted the wire taken off my bottom teeth (it was glued to the back of my teeth after my braces were taken off). I specifically requested that they give me the gas instead of an injection because I can't stand needles in my mouth. I qualified for the gas completely--I had a ride home and no obligations for the minimum six hours afterwards, I was old enough and healthy enough for it, and my insurance covered it.

The old fart who worked on me completely disregarded all of my wishes. Tried to stick a needle in my mouth, and when I couldn't open up for it he just continued without any anesthetic at all. He failed to completely clean out one of the cavities because I was flinching so hard, but he filled it anyways. A year later that filling cracked/came loose and fell out. It's now extremely sensitive to sugar to the point that eating donuts feels like getting a knitting needle stabbed into my jaw.

And then he didn't take the wire off. I still stuck with the damned thing over 6 years later. Several times a year I either get cut or rubbed raw on the tip of my tongue and there's nothing I can do about it.

I don't know whether I was treated this way because I was young, or female, or on Medicare, or too unsure of myself to insist on the requested treatment, but it really pissed me off. I have a hard time trusting dentists now (and most doctors, for the same reasons).",,,,,,,,,

I wasn't happy with the 3 aforementioned curlers, being that they would pinch my skin and I would end up with a L shaped curl after having to press quite hard. The Shiseido was slightly better, but I found that the pad got hard and had to be changed quite quickly, and it still pinched but to a lesser extent. I've been consistently using the Shu curler for years now and I've never been happier and don't see myself switching to another brand. I've used the same pad for a very long time without needing to switch (way past the recommended date) and it grabs all my stick straight hairs and curls them nicely. It also holds the curl far better than the other curlers IMO (placebo effect? idk- but they stay curled all day which is amazing for my Asian stick straight downward pointing lashes).

No, I mean the nobodies of the tournament. Image holding it in Tokyo and all the arcade players joining, and compare that to the Xbox live Westerners. The difference is insane (especially arcade centric games like kof, tekken, etc). Still even if quite a few top players are there, a lot of them aren't. That's why r/kappa has to sponsor players, and why they bring hype players westwards. With home support and cheap/easy entry, people near the venue are much more likely to break through at evo. The fact that NA hasn't won anything but NA centric games in a long time tells you the level isn't there (probably due to lack of arcade culture). 

Note that none of this applies to smash. All the other NA centric scenes are way too small to be legitimately present.

***

Except Marvel is in, an old game with no future and a miniscule scene. And as a worldwide stage, BB, kof etc are very big.

***

Companies can invest in the fgc without this, the scene can grow without evo becoming a sponsorship place. Evo could stay grassroots and represent the scenes rather than the sponsor. Capcom, other than pushing sf4 out, is a decent example. The big event is the pro tour final, not evo. Even capcom majors are allowed to be very different and represent local scenes or sponsorship events (e.g. TGS). Want pokken to explode? Create your own hype event and help  rather than dictate, existing tournaments.

Basically what I'm saying is that the most prestigious fgc should be really fgc based, not based on this sponsorship meddling. Get the best players and the best games there, hence no us and no sponsorship dictating the games. Capcom wants no 4, fine get out. Pokémon game? Fine, let's see if there's a scene with the game as a side tournament. If it's good it'll grow next year. ",,,,,,,,,

You're best to get a paint pen from your dealership, as the color will match for sure, but you can probably also find something at Canadian Tire.

If you take the right amount, it can be semi pleasurable, as long as you can ""sort of"" recall what you experienced in retrospect. These videos online, they're usually of people doing way to much. Friends egging them on to take huge huts and hold it as long as possible. 

Kids usually. 

With that mindset, you aid just so whip its (nitrous) Cuz it's at least euphoric. 

Nobody should try salvia as their first hallucinogenic. It'll put them off to any other trip drug in the future. 

And trip drugs can be life changing, beneficialy. In extreme moderation of course. 

I've done it twice, hated it. Every second. But I had a buddy who went through a phase. Did it frequently.

but i'm struggling tonight

ive been on subs for three years, using on top once a week, until i did a detox two weeks ago with lofexidine, which ended on THursday. It worked well, minimal withdrawals, started to get a real positive head on at the weekend. 

But cold sweats last night, sleeping about 5 hours in 30 hr periods, so i am proper tired, i have always needed my sleep (yes i'm a pussy). Got stomach cramps and frequent visits. And generally feel crappy.

I'm going to tell my detox nurse this when she calls in the morning, but i thought i had cracked it, bt now im struggling

and if i had easy access i probably would score, and fuck up a very important few weeks, a lot is riding on a succesful detox so failure is not an option.

fortunately i am very far away from any access so will not give in to scoring, but scared i'll go back on a script.

Waiting to find the Recipes for these things is *not* worth it: just look it all up online. [This](http://www.destinyislands.com/bbs/melding/) is the list I used for the most part.

&gt;As far as I have seen the game is considered as the hardest KH game up to date and contains some confusing mechanics, thats why I am worried.

When it comes to later Mirage Arena bosses and the other optional bosses? You kinda have to resort to cheese tactics (abusing invincibility frames) because those bosses *will* keep trying to stun lock you to death while generally having very few and pretty brief vulnerable states.

The most confusing mechanic occurs in Ventus's finale, but I won't spoil what happens there.",,,,,,,,,

It looks like he got a 50% refund after emailing corporate, but he wasn't satisfied, so he made a follow-up email laying out exactly what was wrong and even sent a Google link showing the exact math. A couple of days later he was given a full refund and was told that the rate is 0.002 **dollars**. 

They then made a public apology after a similar incident with another account, but did not retroactively correct the problem for other people who had previously raised the issue. They also stated that they'd be correcting their sales material.

Several days later, OP decides to call again and is once again quoted 0.002 cents.

ABH has a rabid fanbase as you can tell by the people responding to negative reviews, so many aren't going to risk it.  Fallout was an issue seen in MR , but I think people were willing to overlook it due to it being ABH and the hype. Then, there is also the fact that Norvina &amp; ABH &amp; her fans aren't making the situation any better by implying that people who are experiencing problems with the palette are people who don't know how to use makeup properly or are not makeup pros. The formula is also different from MR and many people were not expecting that. $42 is a lot to some people, to spend on an eyeshadow palette that they need special tips and tricks for, just to make it work. There isn't a reason why you can't have an eyeshadow that has great color payoff, but minimal fallout. It has been done before and I feel like ABH is just making excuses.  I was genuinely excited to buy this palette, but I think I will hold off on it for atleast a few months. ",,,,,,,,,

This is why I said ""it's not toxic in any way whatsoever as long as you aren't leaving on a burner on high all by itself for 20 minutes"". You could -- literally -- eat a one pound block of PTFE and you will poop exactly one pound of PTFE; nothing will leech into or be absorbed by your body. If you heat it to temps above around 450F then it can cause flu-like symptoms (and still not be ""toxic"").  But we don't make eggs on a 450F pan, because we like eggs that aren't burnt. I mean, what butter could stand up to a 450F pan? I like butter. I don't like burned butter. Melty, Maillard-reactioned butter. Mmmm.

If you want to make eggs, just use a plain non-stick pan and realize that it's not going to kill you, any more than it's harmed the millions of people who have eaten billions of meals cooked on teflon pans since the 1950's.

&gt; What am I missing here, and why is this information so unpopular that my first post in /r/cooking has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended)?

Because it's non-information. It's nonsense, and based on the kind of hippy, pseudo-science scare-mongering junk you see soccer moms and anti-vaxxers forward all over the place and smear facebook with. 

Also, you're coming off as being a little more than slightly rude with anyone who disagrees with said nonsense.",,,,,,,,,

&gt; had I known they would release other things outside of the Ultimate Edition before the fighter packs were even finished, I literally would not have purchased the Ultimate Edition.

That's exactly what that is. You apparently don't care about the *things* that were included, you just want the fact of ""IT ALL"". It does suck that getting ""IT ALL"" isn't really an option, I guess, but ignoring these things' existence, which is what I'll be doing after arguing about it today, still means I'm getting the things I wanted when I paid for them.

I'm interested to see if it's building more on the theme of disorder vs. paranoia.  

Breaking Bad explored this theme quite a bit.  Remember while Walt was actually suffering, going through cancer treatment, Jesse was on the pipe and hiding in his house, seeing imagined biker thugs approaching him, causing him to flee through the neighborhood and to his parent's house.

We saw Walt's bouts with paranoia vs. the calm and contented Walt who killed a room full of neo-nazis in the finale.  We saw people die because Walt was paranoid about what they MIGHT do.

So I'm wondering is this is more exploration of that theme.  Could Chuck's ""disorder"" and Jimmy's future paranoia in the black-and-white epilogue sequences be reflecting each other?  Could the show be exploring what it truly means to be trapped in your home, scared of sudden bursts of excitement because it might land you in the hospital...or maybe jail?  Is this more of Gilligan studying how the mind reacts to perceived threats, or perhaps a simple reference to the fact that Chuck is sorta the opposite of Walt.  Chuck HAD everything.  He had a partnership at a huge law firm, he had money, he had influence, he had a beautiful wife and a great future, but he had his brother.  Walt had almost nothing, though he had a beautiful wife and a family, that's really all he had.  His job was a joke, his health was failing, he had no reputation or legacy and no one was going to remember him other than his family.  

Just thinking out loud.

But CGI Kamakurus moved faster than any of them. And Kamakurus mostly CGI, using a ragdoll for Godzilla tossing him and a puppet for two other shots.

6878,2016,2,czj67ud,,KotakuInAction,1458209300,0,3,0,"&gt; I asked Observer journalists for their experience of comment threads. Most reported being abused. Kate Kellaway told me: “The worst of the comments remind me of road rage – just as drivers feel protected by their cars, so people feel protected by their computers – and behave in ways they wouldn’t dream of behaving if they were introduced to you face to face.”

This pretty much sums up the problem: these publications care more about the feelings of their writers than their readership. They see this is a service to the former over the latter. That's a really big problem. It isn't even about what the journalists said about comment sections. It's about the fact that they asked the journalists at all over polling their readership.

The journalists (and anyone else) can ignore the comment threads if they can't handle them. No one is making them read the comments. Not every comment is going to be civil or reasonable. Some are going to be utterly terrible. But by blowing away the entire section to spare a minority of bad shit you're removing most of the ability anyone has to inform the readership of blatant flaws and falsehoods reported in the article. But I think they know this. That too is probably considered harassment these days.",,,,,,,,,

Cuomo is going to be gloating like nothing else tomorrow. Even Wolf Blitzer was attacking the ""insiders"" for providing bad info. People are only taking notice of that because he attacked a woman though.



I believe Ms. Haberman has been given special status because she's willing to work with the president directly without constantly drumbeating a narrative. Her questions at the briefings were rarely about the narrative of the day so I'm not surprised. She has her moments but so do most of us. Not really sure why the Comey leaker has been brought into the fold. The failing NYT is still considered a respected brand by the people that need to be won over. They are trying to improve brand relations with those of us that can't stand them.

Otherwise there would be an in-app option to ""fast switch"" between accounts without the need of logging in and out.

As for the solution:

Some Android phones have a setting specially designed for this, where apps can have a secondary profile, with a separate account info. On MIUI I believe it's called ""dual apps"".

Also on Android, you can probably do the same thing by having a secondary ""user account"". Though You will probably only receive instant notifications from the account of the current user.

And lastly, you can install one of the many many unofficial Telegram apps. You can be logged in to as many accounts as you want at the same time as long as they are in separate apps.",,,,,,,,,

I am a diehard liquid lipstick fan, I take great care of my lips and wear liquid lipsticks every day but I just can't figure out how people wear these without getting shriveled corpse lips at the end of the day I love these in the morning when I first apply them but by the end of the day my lips look so shriveled and wrinkly. I never have this problem with my lipsticks from Jeffree Star, Dose of Colors, Sephora, or Kat von D. Kat von D is pretty drying but it still doesn't give me corpse lips. These are decent for the price but the more brands I've tried they just suck in comparison to the higher quality stuff. I should've just saved up over a longer period of time and bought the better brands instead of wasting all this money just because these were cheap and I got sucked into the hype. 

**Underhyped: Dose of Colors Liquid Lipsticks** - I just discovered these and I'm in love with them. Youtubers talk about them but I don't see them mentioned here much. Jeffree Star gets a lot of love and I 100% agree with that, it's my all time favorite formula because it straddles the line between being dry enough to not produce transfer, but yet doesn't dry out your lips at all. DoC's formula is practically identical to Jeffree Star and the packaging is so similar that they're probably made in the same factory. I feel like more JS fans need to know this. I love the bold colors JS has but they don't have a lot of nudes whereas DoC has amazing nudes. 

Also I totally agree about Stila Stay all Day liner. It lasts forever which is awesome but I don't like the felt tip at all. It's too stiff and hard to get the line thin and precise and it breaks really quickly. I much prefer the Kat von D tattoo liner brush tip. ",,,,,,,,,

everything in life you experience is from within you. 
everything in life you experience is from within you.
everything in life you experience is from within you....  :)

Basically if you really want to be as happy and joyful as is humanly possible you don't need any external things what so ever, what you need is to be able to consciously choose your thoughts and emotions, you have to look inside yourself with great intensity, or you can do external life with great intensity, whilst also looking inside with great intensity.

What is the point of life? It's to heighten your awareness to turn up the voltage so you see everything as it really is, to turn the light on in yourself, it's all there every second of the day right in front of you everywhere :) 

Psychedelics can be a great wake up call, or help deprogram you from cultural conditioning but they aren't anything more than that.

Turn your attention inwards then you will truly discover life in it's infinite entirety.",,,,,,,,,

Both the Bible and the Quran discourage pre-marital sexual activity.

* Quran: ""[5:5] Today, all good food is made lawful for you. The food of the people of the scripture is lawful for you. Also, you may marry the chaste women among the believers, as well as the chaste women among the followers of previous scripture, provided you pay them their due dowries. **You shall maintain chastity, not committing adultery, nor taking secret lovers.** Anyone who rejects faith, all his work will be in vain, and in the Hereafter he will be with the losers."" (emphasis mine)
* Bible: ""Hebrews 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.

Muslims hold more closely to the Quran than Christians to the Bible. I have no doubt that Muslims that have lived in Western countries for a generation or two relax their faith-based rules to match their surroundings, but the overwhelming majority of Muslims, who live elsewhere or emigrated more recently, will be more likely to look down on dating than a mainstream Christian.",,,,,,,,,

All you have to do is point at one. Just like that, you've successfully explained that there are contingent things and never had to evoke anything non-contingent.

Ultimately this isn't going to work, though. For instance consider the totality of contingent things. The totality is contingent. Therefore the totality has an explanation. This explanation cannot be part of the totality of contingent things (because circular), so it must be something external to the totality. But this could only be something which is necessary. So if you want to (ultimately) explain contingency, you have to appeal to necessity.

7186,2016,2,czjffr8,,MakingaMurderer,1458213716,0,1,0,"&gt; I wonder what constitutes as the middle driveway?

If standing at the entrance and looking in, one goes to the left along the eastern perimeter. One goes to the right along the northern perimeter, and one goes between them into the junkyard.

Anyone driving onto the property would say the one going into the middle of the junkyard would be the middle driveway. That's where the business buildings are.

&gt;(middle is subjective to where you're standing I would think)

How? The one between the other two would be called the middle, no matter how you look at it. If you stood on the eastern perimeter and looked northwest, there would be three driveways, a near one, a far one, and one in the middle between them. Same if you were on the northern perimeter looking southeast.

There is no way to look at those three driveways and call any of them the ""middle driveway"", except the one between the other two.

&gt;Because going into the mass of the yard and finding their way to the Rav4 then becomes a real act of god. At least my way makes it seem like less divine intervention.

Or, you know, there was no act of god - just someone knowing something they claim they didn't.

&gt;It would be interesting to see what path they took.

Sturm told us exactly what path they took. They entered the property down the middle driveway to the business buildings. Then they walked directly south of those buildings towards the RAV4. She described three groups of vehicles - one group directly south of the buildings, another group of two rows directly south of those, and then a third directly south of the second, and directly north of the pond.

They did not mention walking past the car crusher or the vehicles near it. They did not mention walking past rows of cars to the west.

They took a direct path from the buildings to the RAV4 except for the detour around the pond.",,,,,,,,,

I want Gressel to do well but he failed to connect much going forward today. Looked tired early too. Played opposite the league's best rookie CM, Ian Harkes.

I saw a few passes to Kenwyne today (usually he is starved of the ball) but mostly he lived in the shadow of 2 central defenders. Got to be Better​. Back to the bench hopefully - he is a good wrecking ball to test a tired defense, not a starter in my opinion.

I'm really not appreciating Carmona - hopefully he starts to shine more. CDM is a ""dirty work""/unglamorous position so maybe I'm being harsh - but this guy's a DP,  right?

LGP was good. I really think that. He made a couple mistakes mostly due to (necessarily) taking risks because our outside backs think they're Marcelo and can roam forward freely and hang our CBs out to dry. I'm shocked to say this but we missed Jeff Larentowicz today, and his ability to shift and cover for the wing backs. But I still definitely believe LGP is a good CB.

Kann has made some good saves this season, but he clearly is freaked out by Tatas ""play from the back"" game plan. Anytime he didn't have an easy outlet and he fired it long, it was straight turnover. Which is why teams have to be able to connect the lines.

Today's match wasn't real good. Hopefully we see some adjustments and guys like Vasquez earn more playing time.

Worse than now, and arguably worse than when it could only crit from behind on burning players. You would now be required to corner or airblast your target, as only a soldier or heavy wouldn't be able to outrun you. Hell, even airblasting might not work unless you have a wall nearby due to the switch time and the movement speed penalty.

&gt; Powerjack

Still acts as a simple sprint button. Still overpowered.

&gt; Back Scratcher

Balanced, but few would use it in serious play since Medic's would now have trouble building uber off you. 

&gt; SVF

At least it can be used for something now.

&gt; Third Degree

* Overheal stealing isn't useful unless you can see enemy health. otherwise, how do you know if you'll be abble to steal overheal?
* Striking through Medi Beams is dangerous and inefficient, not to mention frustrating for the enemy because you are punishing the Medic and their patient for doing their job. 
* Slower overheal decay and increased healing would be good if not for the hefty health penalty, which neutralizes their benefits.

&gt; Neon Annihilator 

Overpowered. Melee weapons typically aren't used as weapons unless they are used for a crit combo, so the penalties there are rather useless (especially because it can still crit in some situations without a damage penalty). 

More importantly, the immunity to debuffs does not have any equal passive downside. Not only would enemies not be able to see that you are immune to debuffs unless you pulled out the Neon, which is unfair to them, but you would have no real reason to use stock, since melee damage is typically so inconsequential.

After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha in the back of the head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time.[83][84] As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system.[85] Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African-Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the Los Angeles riots ensuing, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.""

Letting her push the button, wave her hand in front of it, showing her how the stall door sometimes sets it off or how when she moves her head/body to the side to wipe her butt the sensor thinks she's gotten up. Afterwards we went outside and drank a huge lemonade and talked about all the times she found a gross potty that hasn't been flushed and about the potties with two different flush directions (#1 and #2) until she had to pee and was ready to give it a shot. She still covers her ears and jumps off the potty as soon as she is done peeing but she will go now without a protest. I think for all of her fears I approach it from the standpoint that all people fear things they don't understand and whenever something CAN be explained/learned about/understood, we can make a special effort with cautious kids to do just that.

You wouldn't give a completely new pilot an immensely expensive ship for him to crash into the nearest asteroid, would you? With increasing ship price, costly (as in, ""loss of ship"") mistakes need to be diminished in frequency as far as possible.

So while he does deserve the ship for buying it, flying it in his current state of knowledge about the game is something I would strongly discourage, for his own good.

It seems that what you're speaking about is our experience of the world.  And how we create our own reality in our minds, which is how we experience the world.  But it's in our minds.

If you want it quote by quote after this, I'd be happy to do it for you. Sorted into categories, ""Pants on Fire"" is the one we can say is just outright lying. ""Mostly True"" and ""False"" could just be mistakes, but we also can't include them as outright lying. They still do not look good for candidates.

 Let us look at every quote from Bernie from these three categories. There are 16 of them, 0 of them in ""Pants on Fire"". 

Hillary has a total of 45 that qualify in those categories (2 in ""Pants on Fire""), Trump has 56 in those categories (with a staggering 17 ""Pants On Fire"" compared to his one ""True""), Cruz has 55 (6 in ""Pants On Fire"") in the same categories. 

So, and this is based on the website you gave me, Bernie is outclassing all of those candidates when it comes to truthfulness of comments. Also remember, I never said that Bernie doesn't lie, I just said he isn't outright lying to my face. Which, *based on your own source*, is something Bernie has never done.",,,,,,,,,

""The creator of the GIF image format, Steve Wilhite of CompuServe, when deciding on the pronunciation, said he deliberately chose to echo the American peanut butter brand, Jif, and CompuServe employees would often say “Choosy developers choose GIF(jif)”, playing off of Jif’s television commercials. If you hear anyone pronounce GIF with a soft G, it’s because they know something of this history. If the Jif peanut butter company never existed, he would have never pronounced GIF with a soft G.

Speaking of Steve Wilhite, when he explains the pronunciation of GIF, he himself has to explicitly write, “It’s pronounced ‘JIF’.” He has to explain it this way because it goes against how it would naturally be pronounced.""",,,,,,,,,

Honestly, take a read of the top post of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/), because while it is about creating a game, a lot of it does still apply to this project here.

A common method proposed to slow the birth rate is a child limit but that could lead to dystopias as well like in the Shadow Children series where a literal Population Police tracks down illegal children (as in third-born on up) to arrest/imprison or worse or in The Giver where babies are produced en masse by women who dedicate all their childbearing years to that common good and married couples can apply for exactly two of them (doesn't mean their applications get approved every time they apply). Also, though you say you're against killing, some people might interpret your last line as you being in favor of killing the ""non-future-minded"" (just wanted to warn you)

Also, you should totally check out Pokemon X and Y, it's the best game pair other than the originals or their reboots to start with.

I move on from 1h swords, or spec into Swords on a future 2h and keep the 1h sword until that point.

**Axe/Mace** are both equal on my lines and seen as utility that never fails in the damage department. They're good generalist weapons and have added bonuses, though I usually take more maces before more axes (more than 2 axes is probably overkill imo, especially on a frontline of 7). 

**Hammer** is great late game and honestly I use them as secondaries most of the time. I equip it as the main when I know I'm about to fight a plethora of Orc Warriors or something but otherwise just switching it out midfight is fine (I mostly just switch all the Mace brothers to Hammers, and I'm currently experimenting if I want to spec into both on said brothers). The 1h Sword brothers also switch to hammers in those scenarios, though I don't consider the consideration of hammer mastery worthwhile on them since, again, I plan for them to be 2h.

**Polearms** are AMAZING but the mastery doesn't contribute anything, really. Polearms take almost no fatigue to operate. 

**Bow** is my preferred range weapon, if not only because of the range and use of the Berserk feature and more versatility overall in terms of moving and fighting. **Crossbows** are still amazing, however.

**Throwing Weapons** and **Daggers** I've never actually played with mastery wise. **Spear** is never worth taking imo as well, unless you're just having fun and want to emulate Roman tactics or something. **Flails** are lethal but if lethality is all you offer I'd rather have comparable lethality and extra damage. **Cleavers** put bleeds, but I'd rather just kill them outright.

7963,2017,8,dkzyai2,,DarkSouls2,1503659773,0,0,0,"&gt; I did get the shield, and while I have had a large leather shield equipped for a very long time, I don't even have the strength to use that. Do I get defense bonuses with it equipped, too, or do I actually have to block with it? I don't have enough stamina to block and attack in my opinion / don't have very good parrying skills.

If you lack the stats to meet an item's requirements, its stats are lowered significantly. For weapons that means very low damage, for shields that means all of its defensive stats go down. You can see by how much with the red numbers on your equipped items menu. Two-handing an item halves the Strength requirement, but if you have to do that for your shield, get a lower str shield or just roll through attacks. Not worth it to stance dance.

For blocking specifically, the numbers represent percentages. So if a shield says 85 physical defense, it blocks 85% of the physical damage you'd receive. The Large Leather Shield is a great early game item because it is like 90 or 95 physical defense.

You do have to actively block with a shield or weapon for those defensive stats to come into effect, just carrying one around is useless if you aren't going to use it. However their special effects, such as item discovery rate or stamina regeneration buff, are still provided as long as they are actively equipped, including holstered on your back.

20 Endurance is a good place to stop your stamina pool for reference. Most people do it there because that is the soft cap. It's all about your personal comfort, though. If you feel you need more stamina feel free to keep putting points into it.

&gt; I have a 'blossom kite shield' but no 'green blossom shield'

This is what I meant. Green Blossoms, incidentally, are items that increase your stamina recovery (which this shield also does) so I just confused the names.

By the way, perhaps you can find Lucatiel in the Gulch? Black Gulch is pretty small and simple but it's got a few places that are easy to miss",,,,,,,,,

Oh yeah, not in this case, but people are doing this all the time, everywhere, all throughout history.  I mean, now we're getting into philosophy.  I think the thing to be careful of is to inject *essential doubt* into any ideology.  Otherwise you end up with weirdos thinking they're justified to start cutting people's heads off, etc.  

The philosophical problem underlying all of this is: if complete truth and perfect truth is inaccessible, how then do we keep from jumping from one ""God"" to another?  (And I think we're on the same page - when I say ""God"" I really mean worldview or ideology.)  Well, we have science, but science is really, really hard and there's Hume's problem of induction which is a real challenge to the notion of using data points to infer an entire population of measurement.

Faze is a powerful team that just can't win and only recently came 2nd after a long time. Idk why, it sucks  because attach is a one of my fav players and zooma is hot.

8209,2017,8,dkzvt6u,,SiegeAcademy,1503658542,0,0,0,"I'm a noob (have never even played a single ranked match) but I main Twitch so here's some tips that work *for me*.

1. Keep the drone hidden during prep phase. You don't want the enemy team to know you're Twitch or else they will be more careful with placing gadgets. E.g. if you shoot out a Kap trap or a Mira mirror or a Jager nader then they will focus on killing your drone before they put up more gadgets. Let them place all their gadgets first before you start destroying them.

2. Use prep phase to shoot outdoor cameras. Usually that's all you have time for, but if you finish early then try to get a couple inside (without being seen).

3. As soon as the round starts, use your prep-phase drone to shoot out cameras near the objective. 

4. Next, scout the objective room and call-out anything relevant to your team (e.g. Frost traps, Valk cam locations, who is camping the objective, where Mira's are located, etc.)

5. Start taking out the gadgets. Start with Mutes, then Miras, then Bandits, then Valks, then Jagers.

6. If you haven't lost your drone yet then start zapping enemies who are on cams. Do a quick zap then hide. Keep them off the cams.

7. When your team is down to 3 players remaining you'll need to start focusing on the objective and getting kills. Park the drone up somewhere and move in.

8. Use your back-up drone the same way you would use a normal drone. It's silent and can take out traps/cameras without making much noise, so it's a huge advantage over normal drones.

9. Focus on killing roamers and enemies near the objective. Other operators are better for breaching objectives and have better armour and guns, so sneaking up on roamers/people outside the objective is my preference.

10. Equip a silencer and be stealthy. Don't stick with the main group, instead flank a bit and try to catch enemies off guard by scouting first with your silent drone.

Anyway I haven't read any guides on using Twitch so I could be using her completely wrong, but this is what works for me.",,,,,,,,,

8307,2017,5,dgz0pw0,,Eve,1496157503,0,0,0,"slightly, in Elite Dangerous you get these things called ""pips"" you get 6 of them and you can distribute them  to your 3 diagnostics, engine, weapons, and systems (utility and shield). This is like if eve had a focused capacitor. Each diagnostics has 4 available slots, and you get 6. With multicrew, you get 7.

With more pips in weapons, your weapons capacitor gets more charge to keep them firing.

in Eng, gives you higher speed, better acceleration, and regeneration for boosts.

With systems (this one is big) it recharges your utility capacitor for things like chaff (flares), but also makes your shields multiplicatively stronger, at 4 pips, you get 2.38x stronger shields. the ramp from 3-4 pips in shields from that extra pip is pretty strong, it's like having an extra large shield extender in flat resists.


Also, ships that have a fighter bay can deploy player fighters instead of NPC pilots (think of carriers here). You put a player in charge of a fighter which makes it much more deadly.


#HOWEVER

Most people that pvp will opt in to just fly solo, because  would you rather have an eagle (for example) with an extra large shield extender, or have that player also fly an eagle, or another ship. You'd obviously choose 2 ships over 1 slightly buffed ship.


EDIT : Another downside to this in PvP is that reps are just modified beam lasers, but only work if youre in the same wing (fleet) as another person. You cant be in a wing in multicrew, the transaction servers would shit itself.",,,,,,,,,

I still do some things on the side, but I was an intern in a youth group while in college, and while I always thought I'd be a high school history teacher - even went and got a masters in history - no teaching job worked out. I applied to over 80 schools in the state, public and private, and only got one interview. Didn't get the job. 


I was volunteering at a church in their youth group, and the preacher and youth pastor there were gently pushing me towards ministry. I was really stubborn and kept pushing back. A job opened up in a nearby town, and they applied to it for me and told me if they called to interview I could be brave and try it, or keep working at the gun store I was working at.

From what it her people have to say it seems like things generally work by either blocking histamines, which powers overall itchyness, or by distracting your nerves into sending temperature or pressure signals instead of itch signals. The foot powder definitely didn't cause heat or cold signals, and it also (as far as I know) doesn't mess with histamines. 

The fact that it doesn't line up with the theories about why the other stuff works had me doubting myself. Originally I started drafting my post in way more couched terms but every now and then I'd notice the itch flair up in a certain part of the burn again and look down to see that the foot powder got rubbed off in that area. The fact that I noticed pretty much right away kept confirming to me how much worse it would if I didn't have anything on.

For your second question, yeah it only helps while it's in direct contact with your skin. If it falls off, it gets rubbed off you need to rub some back in. My burn was on my chest, so it was a bit of a challenge to keep it on. I just kept the tube by me, and kept putting more on until it just felt pretty much like a regular sunburn and I finally went to sleep.

8353,2017,8,dkzu3pc,,DnD,1503657706,0,0,0,"It depends a bit on how you represent wealth in your world.  Consider though that the 5e DMG provides some guidelines for construction costs.  Prices might be higher depending on construction materials or location.  

* 25,000gp for a noble estate  

* 50,000gp for a keep  

* 500,000gp for a palace  

Considering that, 40k gp is roughly what a lord might spend in order to construct a manor or keep.  They'd likely take it on loan from the bank as they wouldn't have that cash on hand.  

Your characters have effectively stolen the worth of a small keep.  In a metropolitan city, that's probably not devastating.  It does depend upon how much in physical assets they keep on hand.  Most transactions are unlikely to be carried out via cash.  It's likely the bank will try to keep the breach a secret until they recover the stolen cash.  This is assuming they recover the stolen trade bars at some point.  If they never recover their assets, they might be in trouble.  They will probably resort to some method to recovering assets that involves demanding immediate payment on certain loans or mortgages.  This may damage their reputation, but they will at least recover their assets.  A noble that can't pay may end up in poverty, a bunch of farmland may end up in the hands of the bank, or a favourite tavern may have to close their doors.

On another note, banks usually store silver trade bars.  Banks don't normally store coins, gems, amulets, and magical items.  That sort of vanity stuff nobles keep on their person and at home to show how rich they are.  I'm not sure how the party managed to cleanly run off with 40k gp in silver trade bars, but that is quite a feat.  The next problem is finding a place to safely store them.  Trade bars also usually carry distinctive stamps of identification.  It will be very hard to fence them in the city where they were stolen.  It may be hard to fence them in general.  Black market contacts are the best bet, but you can be certain that authorities and bounty hunters will be monitoring for such activity.  There are going to be some very power people sent to recovery what was stolen.",,,,,,,,,

I've made a highly specific claim. It is: excluding Computation, there is very little new technology in comparison to previous periods. Soon we shall have seen lots of change in Computers, but almost very little change in many areas of the economy for *half a century*.

This position should be easy to attack and yet you have given no examples of why it is self evidently wrong.

You merely stated automotive batteries became widely available a decade or two later than I suggested, which since they existed before that is a moot point. The real point is that there is no change.

If the game comes out and it doesn't have any of the modes you mentioned, this argument might hold some more weight. As for now, you're just assuming that the game will be garbage because you hate the  publisher.

They might mention there was a brief skirmish between two units, but they wouldn't describe the entire fight in detail. On the face of it, though, I can't imagine it would have presented much of an issue. Contrary to the stereotype of scimitar vs straight sword, the most common kind of sword for both medieval Christians and Muslims at the time of the crusades was a straight-bladed arming sword. Curved swords in Islamic armies was mostly limited to Turkic-speaking mercenary groups. So there wouldn't have been much of an issue of adapting to a new weapon, and I can't imagine that they would have rejected using an enemy's weapon in an emergency situation or even in general. I'm not a Crusades expert, but I've never read anything remotely related to the topic of using enemy weapons in the cursory reading I have done on it. The Crusader states didn't have a problem with hiring locals armed in indigenous fashion to supplement their armies, so I don't know that they would have viewed Muslim soldiers' weaponry as inherently wrong in some way. Really, the aristocratic Muslim warrior probably wasn't altogether much different than his Frankish counterpart: lance, straight sword, mail shirt/coat, horse, metal helmet. The designs of these things might look somewhat different, but the fundamentals were similar in function if not in form. 

This is a huge jump in time that has no relation to the Crusades whatsoever, but the book I mentioned above describes British officers who lost their swords picking up Indian weapons quite frequently. The impression I get is that in a scenario where fighting is desperate enough that you've broken your sword, you are willing to do practically anything to survive. Even if there was some kind of ideological stance against using the enemy's weapons, that might not have mattered in the heat of battle. ",,,,,,,,,

I used to play with my dolls in front of the wardrobe mirror, the reflections amused me; I'd pretend that reflection me was a friend instead. Obviously I grew out of it, yet I couldn't help stopping by a mirror, if one ever crossed my path. 

They say that eyes are windows to the soul. A gateway. It had to be true. When I looked into that mirror, straight into my eyes, it felt eery. Unsettling. My eyes were red from crying but before I looked away, a figure flashed in front of my eyes. 

Clouds darkened above me, the sound of rumbling grew louder. I didn't have an umbrella, but I wasn't too far from home. I remembered the figure, and the face I saw after the figure. I was curious, too curious, so naturally I looked into the mirror again. There -  a face; dark hair, light eyes, unfamiliar - no, unrecognizable. 

There, sat on a bench, a pencil in one hand and a notebook in the other, he scribbled away. I sat on the swings, keeping my distance, the cold wind cutting my face. I couldn't help but look. 

Ordinarily extraordinary. He looked up, his pale green eyes slightly grey, held my gaze and raised an eyebrow. I looked down, suddenly shy. The skies thundered, making me jump. And I noticed him walking towards me, glancing up at the sky once or twice.

""Do you need an umbrella?"" he asked. I felt the first drops of rain on my cheek as I shook my head, and pulled up my hood. 

""We should probably get going..."" he seemed hesitant, ""Want me to walk with you?"" 

I didn't know what made me talk. Maybe it was his kind eyes, maybe it was his thoughtful words. He felt safe. 

""Yes.""",,,,,,,,,

8737,2017,8,dkzne7o,,UKPersonalFinance,1503654274,0,0,0,"&gt;Yeah, yeah, students eating beans on toast and all that, but you don't do that every day for a year. I was a student for 4 years and I did not know a single person that ate on that kind of budget.

It's definitely do-able, I just finished my 3 year degree and managed it very comfortably. It's not like I was scraping the barrel either, I had a varied diet and didn't skimp on meat etc at all.

&gt;you can't buy a panini from the student union when you slept in too late to pack lunch

Prepping a lunch the night before would prevent this.

&gt;can't buy a bag of sweets to study with

A few sweets won't exactly break the budget. I'd always have a drawer filled with chocolate/biscuits in case I fancy something, or need something to keep me ticking over at the library between meals.

&gt;If you want to eat meat or drink anything other than water you are not going to get through a week's food on £20.

Asda, 4 litre bottles of orange juice for £2.30, 1kg of chicken for £4.50, 750g for 5% fresh beef mince for shy of £5. Carbs are cheap as chips, as are vegetables. That mean will definitely last more than a week.

&gt; Who's buying your enormous cooking pots? 

You say this as though purchasing cooking equipment is only something that the OP would have to do if they were to take my advice. Funnily enough, I think they'll have to buy some anyway. You don't need industrial sized gear as a student, even cooking for a couple of days at a time.

&gt;Who's buying your spice rack and your herbs?

Again, not overly expensive and not exclusive to cooking on a budget.

&gt; Are you getting a taxi back from the place on the other side of the city that does the 20 kilo bags of rice for £6.99?

No, but I have heard of a fantastic new concept known as ""online shopping"". Some retailers offer £1 delivery, who would have thought it!

A few of my friends used to walk to the Lidl and split a £4 uber back with their stuff, which is an option if there is one near enough, but I always just used online shopping.

It's not too hard to do it if you can plan things to a half decent degree (it's not like I was using spreadsheets to count how many grams of meat i could eat per day), but I can see where your scepticism comes from.

Eating at restaurants would have been the biggest thing to go against the budget, but I'd have just taken that out of my monthly ballpark figure for ""entertainments"" (i.e. drink, going out, what have you). Obviously though, if OP's on a strict budget, going to restaurants isn't going to be a priority.

&gt;£30 for everything else is absolutely not enough

My main constraint on that was the drink, which is hard to budget I suppose. I was thinking £10 drink, £5 phone, £5 gym, £5 laundry/toiletries/etc and £5 for whatever else there was.
If i've missed anything major let me know, but I don't think that's too outlandish.",,,,,,,,,

I can really relate to this. I struggle with self-love, too, even after all this time of practicing the Buddha-dharma. I also really understand what it's like to crave social validation, it's a struggle and it's an easy thing to slip into non-questioning.

I think deleting your social media is an excellent move. I did the same and it helped tremendously. It really takes the legs out from a bad habit, and I think once you get the hang of being without it, and replacing it with other things to spend your time on, you'll feel much better.

&gt;If they're a person who withholds opinions, that is their genuine state of being.  It's like if I'm naturally an introvert and don't talk, then to speak my mind would appear genuine in your book, but it wouldn't be what I naturally/authentically inclined to do.  For me to speak my thoughts would diverge from my natural inclination and authentic expression.

The thread continues to be about genuine expression, not about whatever you are describing. Not everyone is capable of doing it, sure, but that's not the relevant issue.

&gt;There probably isn't anything that couldn't be genuine in my approach.

&gt;This is false and is a personal attack. See rule 1.4. Do you want to edit it out?

No not particularly. It's not a rule 1.4 violation as its countering the point you just made. You made the claim that you value all life and love homosexuals. I pointed out that you don't care fur homosexuals or their lives as you engage in activities that make both their lives objectively worse and shorten their lives.

8947,2017,5,dgyweff,,CanadaPolitics,1494516677,0,0,0,"He could have made a stronger case, but it boils down to the fact that what is actually feasible / good policy and what the public wants are often at odds. The public will generally support anything that sounds good in isolation. Do you favor paying less tax? Would you like to see a better health care system? Do you want the government to run a balanced budget? Most people will answer yes to all of these questions, especially if they are only being asked one in isolation from the other. But of course you can't lower taxes, hike spending, and balance the budget all at once. And then, in addition to the individual contradictions, you have the special interests, which are the groups that I'm not a part of (if I'm a part of them, then they are just valid interests) that want money from the government - artists looking for patronage, scientists seeking grants, provinces begging for bigger handouts. Now, the government can't afford to give everyone everything they ask for, so again it becomes about trade-offs. This sort of behind the scenes bartering doesn't play well with a public that by-and-large has never grown much beyond their childhood conditioning. The left and the center would be outraged. The right wouldn't be, but it would certainly pretend to be when the other guys were in power, which amounts to the same thing politically speaking. So it's not really about party loyalty. It's about providing a space for the government to have realistic, adult discussion about policy before they figure out how to explain it to the kids. ",,,,,,,,,

I don't use them daily, so our experiences will differ. But if your experience is the norm for daily use, and you can only count on them for a few months of daily use, then anyone else who expects to use them daily should avoid the purchase. That's disapointing.

OR you don't buy in to either the democrips or rebloodlicans. 

Bernie and Trump have a fair amount in common. They're both anti-establishment populists. They both support a non-interventionist foreign policy. They both support some form of welfare state (less for Trump, but significantly still *more* than the standard GOP party line). They both support some form of protectionism. They're both reasonably liberal on across-the-aisle civil liberties (guns for Bernie, abortion for Trump).

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Siege was *never fundamentally broken*. It is and always was a mechanically fantastic game. The only problems Siege had at launch were that there weren't too many players and a couple guns were a bit OP. 

Fixing weapon balance in Siege by changing a couple damage values is nothing like what has to happen to For Honor to not suck. 

The characters in For Honor that have unblockable openers will always be mechanically better than the ones that don't. 

Feinting actually makes no sense and every time you saw an indicator that your opponent ""fell for it"", then you should have raw heavy'd instead. (the game would actually be less defensive and better all around if feinting didn't exist)

Characters without reliable means of attack have to fish for parries to be able to do any damage.

In a match between two equally skilled players playing ""parry characters"", the winner is determined largely by luck.

The game is buggy as all hell.

Attacks *go through block* and a multitude of other issues that can completely lose you the match due to no fault of your own. In my tournament match Vs hhhhmmm1 for 3rd place, his top light went through my top block 13 or 14 times *in a row* and he 5-0'd me. This can happen when you're practicing vs a bot so it isn't completely due to latency. 

There's a million other things, but I guess what I'm saying is that For Honor can never be a legitimate E-Sport until it's *mechanical flaws* get fixed. Unfortunately I think fixing them requires changes to the core of the engine, so I doubt very much that they will all get fixed during For Honor's lifetime. Hopefully they can fix them in a sequel.  

Honestly, I'm not trying to rain on your parade or be a negative downer. I legitimately appreciate your enthusiasm and can respect the fact that you want the game to be as amazing as possible, I just don't realistically think that it can be what we wish it could be.

I've gotten 5th, 4th and 9th at my last three tournaments in For Honor, I understand the game competitively and I just don't think that it can be fixed to the point it needs to be at for it to be a major competitive fighting game. 

I've played tons of games competitively, I was Sponsored in Counter-Strike, top 100 Coh2, competitive Super Smash Bros Melee, Street Fighter, Marvel, and the list goes on. You just can't build a healthy competitive scene when the foundation of the game is fundamentally broken. 

There's always going to be people playing and there's always going to be people trying to have a competitive scene and hosting tournaments, but the dream to have For Honor at the main stage at Evo or something....Well I think it's always going to stay a dream. 

I do hope I'm wrong, I guess we'll see eventually. I would caution about getting too emotionally invested into the game though, you may end up turning into me. ",,,,,,,,,

As someone who was raised Catholic, I always knew that the nuns and priests were chaste. As I got older I learned more about the scandals within the church. Yes, shocking, the Catholic church has had many sex scandals. From molestation accusations that run always up the hierarchy of the church, to that of some of the older Popes having children, and everyone's favorite Halloween costume: pregnant nuns. For a church that preaches against premarital relations, against abortions, they sure do have their fair share of sex-related scandals. It made the church look hypocritical, and made me question the validity of the teachings throughout my life. I was supposed to go into a room and confess my sins to a priest, who my mom would warn me regularly not to go anywhere with. It seemed like an impossible double-standard.",,,,,,,,,

So anyway, this was back in my Army days.  Jeanine was a friend of some of my friends.  They all wanted her, but she never slept with any of them.  I figured I had no chance either so I never tried anything with her, but one night she flirted with me and I reciprocated.  This led to us basically talking and flirting and light petting whenever no one was looking for about a month.  

One weekend my roommate was off banging some chick and Jeanine comes over to my room.  We end up making out and I eventually go down on her, but she wanted me to keep my boxer briefs on.  Whatever, I'm a fucking master diver who loves his trade and she had those really puffy outer lips that you have to slide your tongue up in order to push them to the side to get at the clit.  Must have licked her for an hour, legs trembling uncontrollably, sheets a fucking mess.  After that, she just wanted to go to sleep.  So me and my blue balls cuddled the fuck out of her and passed out.  

A couple weeks later we met up at a club we all went to once a week and she asked me to stay the night.  I agreed.  Problem was, we couldn't stay at her place because she still lived at home and she's Jewish with the typical racist parents who wouldn't approve of her banging a non-Jew.  My room at the barracks is 70 miles away.  

I decide to just get us a hotel room and crash there in the city that night.  We finally have sex, but this is where everything falls apart.  I can't go down on her because she has her period so I'm already bummed a bit, but it gets worse.  I'm inside of her and literally every 10 seconds she's freaking the fuck out and asking me to stop and check the condom to ensure it's still on and hasn't broken.  I keep having to turn the lights on to check because even though we're under sheets the whole time she still doesn't want to do it with the lights on.  So I pull out and I check.  Condom still there, still loose at the tip, not a tear in sight.  This went on for maybe 5 minutes before I faked a fucking orgasm just to end the misery.  I kinda went aloof on her for a couple weeks and eventually broke up with her.  

All my friends thought I was a fucking idiot for tossing her to the side or that I was really terrible in bed or whatever other shit they could imagine.  I never told anyone though, and Jeanine and I just became friends again.",,,,,,,,,

I recommend trying to use centralized whitelists instead

https://dodistribute.com/

This site was created by Rami Ismail of Vlambeer fame. Its a site to bring together creators like yourself, and streamers/promoters. Streamers/promoters are pre-authorized so your keys will always go to legitimate people. You've probably had like 100 people claming to be TB/Northernlion/PewDePie/Markiplier/etc. DoDistribute is a great way to ensure you're sending your stuff to the 'real deal'.

There are a few others, like the Yogcast guys have something. 

https://www.keymailer.co/

Though I don't know how widely used it is or if its list is reliable or not.

Blacklist generally wont work since scammers just swap emails constantly.

In any case there some resources available. Most seem to be going to these kinds of centralized authoirzations platforms to better control their content going to legitimate sources.

The one in Ocala gets most of its stuff from retail stores and is way overpriced on most things. The only good stuff there is their jewelry and antique stuff although everything is researched and at a little above average. 
On the other hand, the goodwill in Gainesville has very little retail stuff. Because Gainesville is a college town you can get a ton of great stuff at low prices, especially when all the college students leave for home and drop off all their stuff. They don't usually have jewelry or antiques but you'll find a ton of great furniture and home decor as well as clothes.

Opening statement: 

In my opinion; EVE isn't a game. It's a hobby. More like being in a bowling/pool league. The social is what makes this game fun. 

EVE is a sandbox; you can do mostly what you want within the few rules CCP sets out. You will note that most things in the gam hie are made by players and a lot of the out of game tools/websites are player run as well. We have an amazing community :)

How do I start:

I strongly suggest that you don't start out this hobby playing solo as in most cases you likely won't stay long; in most cases it is best to be with others to have fun. Join a new player friendly corp like Brave Newbies, Dreddit,
EVE University, Karmafleet, or Pandemic Horde  They will teach you this game. 

Things to know right now:

Don't be afraid to lose a ship (or 100). Ships are disposable for the most part. 
However don't fly what you can't afford to replace. Bling does not equal win (for the most part) in EVE. Nor does EVE follow the bigger is better model. It's about the right tool for the job. (This isn't WoW or other ""normal"" MMO's). 

Your in game skill points are also in many cases not as important as the skills you have/decisions you make so don't worry about having to catch up or being low skill points when compared to others. You can still have fun and be super useful, even day 1!

You can be scammed in game and it's allowed. If something sounds too good to be true; it likely is.

I mean there are people with visible/invisible disabilities, so someone could have a broken back and be struggling with the same feelings and thoughts about not being able to work again or do the things they love. So don't feel like you are abusing a system that is in place for struggling people. It's good to just start with seeing a doctor or therapist from now to give yourself a better chance, so hopefully your dad will come around and help you out by paying for  some therapy sessions.

I know how hard it can be to muster up the courage to face the world and get things done. for the past 2 months I have been a hermit avoiding the outside world as much as I can but eventually you will turn around even if it's just going out to see the doctor at the moment, that's still an accomplishment.

 BCE (Before the Common Era)  has been dated back to  Rabbi Morris Jacob Raphall’s Post-Biblical History of the Jews in 1856.

  &gt;At present, there is no true way to earn bitcoin that doesn't have some hidden (and often instantaneous) bitcoin-fiat conversion occurring behind the scenes. You pay your contractor in bitcoin, they exchange it for fiat. But what if your contractor's expenses were all paid in bitcoin? And that contractor had other contractors who only dealt with bitcoin? A closed-loop environment such as this is just what we are intending to bring to bitcoin (whilst only lightly loading the blockchain). 

&gt;Code Valley technology is an entirely new method of developing software; one that doesn't require small groups of developers, but is instead capable of harnessing the expertise of thousands of developers to build a single software program. Software programs are built in minutes by this 'supply-chain' of software developers who all transact exclusively using bitcoin. In the supply-chain, one spends bitcoin to deliver their expertise (which is an amalgamation of others' expertise), and is also **paid in bitcoin** for that expertise (with a tidy little profit margin in between, of course!). 

&gt;There is no denying that we are making some provocative statements (and have received  [responses in kind](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=7957269&amp;cid=50457833) ), but we hope that you can put your initial incredulity and pre-judgement aside before making your assessment of this technology. Feel free to have a read through the documentation on  [our site](http://codevalley.com) , which is continuously updated based on (welcome) feedback from the community. 

&gt;We are proposing a decentralised marketplace for software expertise. There is only one logical monetisation scheme that can match such an ambitious proposal; bitcoin.

&gt;Welcome to the design-domain.",,,,,,,,,

However I personally land family members cause it makes for a better story. If you have high enough legalism you can enable viceroyalty laws which allows you to make a title a viceroyalty which means the top liege (you) are always the heir to that title. It lowers vassal limit and accrues a small opinion malus with all direct vassals but negates power creep. You can even do this with duchies with legalism 8.,,,,,,,,,

9646,2017,8,dkzuu7c,,magicTCG,1503658067,0,0,0,"&gt; There is no incentive for a player to call it on their opponent anyway so what effect will this have anyway?

The punishment for a player who refuses to call a judge on a player who asks for a concession or for refusing to call a judge on a player who they suspect is throwing the match should be a DQ and an investigation that may lead to a ban. Destroying the integrity of a tournament via match-fixing should have a serious zero tolerance punishment. I expect the risk of being disqualified and banned is a sufficient deterrent in most situations to not allow this behavior.

&gt;I know that if I am playing against a Lantern player and they have the lock down that my outs get thinner and thinner. Winning the game isn't the only objective of a player, they may value other things like time away from the draw go nature of that game more highly than sitting there for 20+mins waiting for their slim chance to come to fruition.

I played against Lantern Control this past Saturday and beat them 2-1. They assembled the lock in game 2 and I had a few outs left in my deck. ""mill you... mill you... mill me... mill both... ok you can draw that"" doesn't take 20 minutes to finish the game. It's rather fast once you reach that point. This idea that Lantern takes forever to win is just a myth. A competent Lantern player will go through their mill sequence quickly and then it's on you not to slow play with the card they let you draw. We finished that game within 5 minutes of the lock getting assembled, and I conceded when he untapped with 6 mill effects on the board when I had 5 cards remaining in my library (ie the game was over on my next draw and it was impossible to win).

You're foolish if you concede a game when you have outs, unless in the exceptionally rare situation where if you don't concede now, then you won't have time to start a 3rd game. That's a tactical decision, not punting the match to your opponent. Considering we are talking specifically about conceding game 3 (presuming you're 1-1) when you have outs to play to, that's an absolutely foolish thing to do. If you don't play to your outs, you're just a bad player who completely fails to understand the concept of a card game.",,,,,,,,,

The doctors that operated on him after he was released could testify how reckless/cruel the original doctors were. It's not the job of the police to tell doctors their business. Even if they're dealing with a stone cold cop killer they have to administer medical treatment regardless of how the police feel about that. Doctors know these things. The ethics are very clearly outlined and make up part of their qualification for a medical license.

I believe they neglected their responsibility to administer care and violated their hippocratic oath in doing so. I have no doubt that they were pressured by the cops, but the doctors knew he had been run over, they knew he was complaining of a neck injury and they knew when he was discharged the cops would take him to jail. They discharged him without so much as an x-ray. That's negligence, plain and simple.

The man was forced to endure a broken neck for 36 hours in a jail environment, which I would argue is a significant contributor to his permanent neck injury (if not the sole reason). Because of the actions of those doctors, an innocent person was sentenced to live in pain *for the rest of their life*. As if being arrested for the crime of being run over by a cop wasn't traumatic enough, the nagging pain of his injury will be there, reminding him until the day he dies.

9791,2016,2,czjbxmp,,Catholicism,1458212064,0,9,0,"I believe abortion is murder, but I don't identify as ""Pro-Life"" for this very reason. ""Pro-Life"" is a political ideology. Thinking abortion is murder and being in favor of attempts at enforcing criminalization at all stages and in all cases are not necessarily the same thing. This is likely why, though they won't say it publicly for fear of weakening their lobbying for their preferred solution, most bishops have NOT in fact denied communion to anti-criminalization politicians after meeting and talking with them privately. 

Because an anti-criminalization position isn't, necessarily, heresy or anything like that. The question of what exact use of the State's limited resources and manpower will best maximize human lives saved/minimize abortions...is ultimately a prudential question. Catholic politicians are bound to, in conscience, pursue those policies they think will maximize lives saved, basically. They are not, strictly speaking, bound to believe that this is by a particular regime of criminalization since whether that will best achieve its effect (or at least better than putting the same resources into more indirect means) is a question of contingent fact.

Don't get me wrong, I'd probably outlaw all abortions if I were King. Certainly I think it's very hard to support not criminalizing after viability, or even after the first trimester. But a position of absolute criminalization is not required by Catholic thought. You aren't required to support a specific regime of penalties, a specific frequency of prosecutions, a specific percent of allocation of police resources, a specific plan for conducting sting operations to entrap doctors, a specific office set up to investigate miscarriages as potential wrongful deaths, a specific registry to track pregnancies and make sure they come to term, etc. They don't like to tell you this, but you're not.",,,,,,,,,

9821,2016,2,czjf9aw,,Vaping,1458213631,0,3,0,"Regulated mods have two circuits. The circuit between the batteries and the regulating chip, and the circuit between the chip and the atomizer.

The wattage you set the device to sets the output goal. The chip then starts pulling from the batteries at that wattage. The atomizer resistance has nothing to do with it at this stage. If you set 50 watts, it pulls 50watts from the batteries. The voltage charge of the battery determines how many amps of strain this puts on the battery, amps=watts/volts. As your battery voltage drops, amp load increases to maintain the wattage. So unlike a mech mod, you reach maximum amp load at final discharge of the battery because the wattage is fixed by the chip.

Now there is the second circuit between the chip and the atomizer. Based on the resistance of the atomizer, the chip ""steps"" (non technical explanation; it adjusts) the voltage to deliver the desired wattage to the coil based on the coils resistance.

So on a regulated mod your atomizer resistance really only affects the amount of stepping required to deliver the desired wattage.

What does this mean in terms of vaping experience? Well, it really just boils down to the physical characteristics of the coil that determine the resistance. A lower ohm coil probably has more metal in it. So at equal wattage, a coil with less resistance will have longer ramp up time due to the mass of wire to heat up. As opposed to a mech mod where a lower ohm coil actually means more watts being delivered to the coil since there is no regulation.

So why have lower ohm coils on a regulated mod? More wire means more surface area. More surface area means more juice being vaporized, so stronger hits. But, because of the regulation, you have to increase the watts to compensate for the ramp up time of the lower ohm coil.

This really oversimplifies some of the minutia of coil builds, wicking, and heat flux, but it gets the point across.

If zerg builds a medium amount of lings, enough to potentially ward you away but not pursue, then you need to micro really well and try to pick off as many lings as possible before they have speed, and preferably try to kill 2+ queens.

9905,2016,2,czj7ikq,,MMA,1458209913,0,29,0," To be honest, a large part of Burrough's success has come from his incredible athleticism, and especially how that has translated into his almost unstoppable blast double-leg takedown (by far the takedown he scores most frequently from). 

On top of this, a lot of Burroughs' offense comes from his low wrestling stance, to the point where he will sometimes go as far as to put one or both of his knees onto the mat. This is called bear-crawl stance, and if you try it in MMA it will probably not go over very well (see Jon Jones v. Vitor Belfort and imagine if soccer kicks were actually allowed).

 And whether it is in folkstyle or freestyle, Burrough's top and bottom skillsets do not have much to transfer over to MMA in terms of viable technique. This is not to say that Burroughs is not very technical within the sport of wrestling, on top of his incredible pressure, control, and athleticism in general. Just that it would not be very well-suited for mixed martial arts, as opposed to a guy like Ben Askren, who still uses a lot of wrestling-oriented controls and scrambling in his fights.

And that is really where the bulk of the problem lies. While Burroughs himself could make the transfer over to MMA, and have his wrestling work spectacularly, it is not really necessarily something that could be imparted to other fighters. His technical knowledge would not be the cutting edge, but rather his decades of experience in the sport, as well as his incredible athleticism and drive. 

But that said, his style would be especially unsuited for an established fighter like Conor McGregor. I don't think Conor has a body type, or fighting style, that would be particularly enhanced by Burrough's style of wrestling. While Burroughs he could certainly still coach Conor well enough, in terms of pure wrestling fundamentals, I just don't think he is the right guy for the job for being someone so high-status and focused on their own athletic career.

Maybe working with Burroughs would be beneficial, as a one-off training partner or guest coach. But McGregor would be much better off with finding a coach that can cater to his existing style, especially one with experience in regards to teaching directly to the mixed marital arts format. An example being Izzy Martinez, the MMA-centric wrestling coach of Jon Jones, Holly Holm, and Anthony Pettis, among others.

Conor does not need or have much to learn from the offensive-machine and brute-force heavy style of Jordan Burroughs... Even the takedowns  themselves do not play to Conor's body type, fighting style, or with his wide-set bladed stance. Right now Conor's main focuses should be on takedown defense, cage work (especially being pushed up against it), and clinching with the possibility of obtaining jiu-jitsu centric takedowns. We have seen some wrestling from McGregor, but most of it is coming from his grappling base with John Kavenaugh, and involves trips and upper-body wrestling.",,,,,,,,,

Tell them to fuck off.

No.

&gt;The Jets have inquired about Jakub Voracek and Michael Del Zotto in a deal for Andrew Ladd

No.

&gt;The Blackhawks have offered Brandon Mashinter for Sam Gagner

No.

&gt;The Blackhawks have offered Bryan Bickell and a 3rd for Sam Gagner

This is more intriguing to me, but unless they eat a significant portion of Bickell's $4m/year deal and/or upgrade that pick, I'd still say no deal.

&gt;The Blackhawks have offered Kyle Cumiskey for Sam Gagner

The Hawks like Sam Gagner, eh? I don't like this trade, either.

&gt;The Bruins have offered Adam McQuaid for Nick Schultz

I would take this deal if they eat half of McQuaid's contract.

&gt;The Hurricanes have inquired about Nick Cousins

Ok.

&gt;A Nail Yakupov for Michael Del Zotto deal may be in place

Intriguing. Need details.

&gt;A Jordan Eberle for Michael Del Zotto + may be in place

Intriguing as well. Seems like Edmonton likes MDZ...

&gt;The Canadiens have offered David Desharnais/Alexei Emelin + Dale Weise for Brayden Schenn + 2nd

No. We need to shed shit contracts, not take them on.

&gt;The Canadiens have offered David Desharnais + 3rd + 2017 2nd + Mike Condon + Dale Weise for Michal Neuvirth + Brayden Schenn + 2017 5th

Interesting proposal with a lot of moving parts. I'm not super opposed to the idea, but I think we're taking on more salary than we should be here. Unsure about Condon's contract details. Wouldn't want to trade for a guy that will block Stolarz in the AHL.

&gt;The Canadiens have offered 2017 1st + Zach Fucale for Brayden Schenn + David Kase

Also intriguing. They really want Schenn. I might just be willing to accept this, depending on how high we think that pick might be...

&gt;The Canadiens have offered 1st + 5th + 6th + Jacob De La Rose + for Matt Read + Brayden Schenn + David Kase + 5th

Again, intriguing. I think the value on the prior trade was better, unless the picks coming from MTL improves a bit. I like De La Rose, though. He's one of the very few prospects they have that might fit well with us.

&gt;A Patrik Berglund for Matt Read deal may be in place

Ok? We don't need another Center.

&gt;The Canadiens have offered Nikita Scherbak + Brett Lernout + LA's 1st for Wayne Simmonds

Lol tell them to fuck off with this.

&gt;The Canadiens have offered Devante Smith-Pelly + Nikita Scherbak + Daniel Audette + conditional 2016 1st (MTL) (becomes 2016 1st (LA) if Montreal misses the 2016 playoffs) for Wayne Simmonds

Closer to a deal. Still no, though.

&gt;The Canadiens have offered Nikita Scherbak + Morgan Ellis + 1st + 2nd for Wayne Simmonds

Again, closer that the original deal, but I still won't take it. Simmonds' value to our PP and team cannot be understated. MTL will have to overpay to get him.

&gt;The Capitals have inquired about Radko Gudas

I would take Alex Ovechkin for Gudas, straight up. Ovechkin didn't even make the All-Star game this year over guys like John Scott. What a scrub, they should dump him while they have the chance.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking ""What's the story"" or ""Why or why not?""  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title.
