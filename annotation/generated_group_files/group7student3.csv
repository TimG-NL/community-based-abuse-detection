9	dgy2l8u	dgyu8ei	AskAnAmerican	Go into more detail, please. I know it's anecdotal, but I don't run across people with anecdotal experience of two systems very often.	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."

17		dgytefr	Vive		"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."

This does not make the music good or the fans less annoying. The best thing about metal is that part of it does not not take itself too seriously, it balances itself in a way. Tool takes itself way to seriously it is just a horribly mundane band with a cult like following. 	I love Tool but their fanbase is pretty terrible.

57	dgz1e6e	dgz1mix	Blink182	"I was just referring to like the band's current ""home base"", but how would an album titled California represent a departure from their Californian roots? lol

Essentially up until the hiatus/before the reunion, blink's roots and background were always based out of San Diego. Always. But once Mark moved to L.A. it became a grey area, especially since Travis moved to L.A. not long after joining. But now enter Skiba (from Chicago) and exit Tom (the only member left who permanently resides in San Diego), that part of the band's history is definitely gone atm, regardless of the song.

For example, during the hiatus when social media was much less extensive, their MySpace page listed San Diego (I think it may have actually even said Poway) as their hometown, but now when you look at their Twitter it says Southern California, which is pretty much playing it safe. Makes reasonable sense. Either way, California is their identity as a whole."	"Look at the themes of the songs. Even though they're light and poppy, there are a bunch with a dark undertone. Even the final song, ""California"", to me is a salute to the not-so-perfect California: perfect weather, yet stay inside; empty as a movie set; etc.

Southern Cali has been part of the band since untitled. Easy Target even mentions Southern California and running from it in a round-about way."

I figure its the same here, where the start up of the motion control resets or is set at some point of the game that I'm in a less than optimal ""neutral"" position that i have to reaaally fight for control. 

I could also try upping the sensitivity and as others suggested, continue using the stick until i neeed fine tuned aiming. Which I guess isn't too much of a deal since I am playing ink heavy weapons like brushes, rollers, and MG."

95	dkywabr	dkzrymd	BuildaCarAVForMe	"The Bose I believe are 3 ohm so you might run into issues with overloading the amp since the Infiniti's you listed are 2 ohm. I would look at 4 ohm speakers. 

I would use the Kappa crossovers since they are built for the frequency response of the speaker set. the factory curve might not line up well with the speakers. 

I would not waste money on replacing all those speakers if you are going to install a separate amp. music is recorded in 2 channel so the biggest bang will come from getting and installing a good set of component speakers in the front with that amplifier. You will not have the ability to adjust or tweak the center channel with a good DSP. and the rears are just playing what the fronts are doing which will muddy up the staging and imaging."	Thanks for the info and the advice.

98		dgz0b1m	KotakuInAction		"It's funny because people keep asking for a ps2 emulator for vita, and I tell them it's not physically possible but they don't believe me. Ps2 is a monstrously complex system, to the point where its graphics bus is faster than ps3's. 

Im surprised they didn't port the PSP versions of those games over, and use the ps2 assets. PSP was not a complex system, it couldn't be since it was battery​ powered.    

Edit: PSP is no longer batter powered"
99	dgym95m	dgytm9h	Games	">It’s no fact that Stardew Valley takes a lot from Nintendo’s Harvest Moon and Undertale takes a lot from Earthbound, 

...Nintendo didn't develop Harvest Moon.  They didn't even publish it.

And Undertale isn't based off Earthbound, not really.  It's more inspired by Mother 3.

But I guess you're right, in a sense, ""it's no fact""."	"I can't speak to undertale but the spirit of the part about stardew Valley is still spot on. They could have made a ""fan harvest moon"" and been shutdown but instead just made a proper game and did fine."

It's a made up word that doesn't mean shit, and was added to the Oxford Dictionary around 20 years after Mary Poppins was released.

The way that infallibility is understood gives some pretty clear outlines. "	"&gt; Why wasn't the Son's two wills defined in the 4th century?

I'm not as theologically educated as you are, but as I understand it we have Councils in response to heresy as it arises. So we had Nicaea in response to the Arians and Chalcedon in response to the monophysites. So why wasn't *ex cathedra* defined after the Great Schism or at the Council of Trent?

I'm hoping that the Grimm more closely related to the source of Grimm, and whatever Cinder is using, are more like an eldritch abomination than just some copy&amp;paste lizard. "

129	czj6dde	czj9j1g	AskReddit	"I am really excited to answer this!!!

1. Hillary has been an advocate for women and children her entire life. After graduating at the top of her class, she went to work for the [Children's Defense Fund](http://www.childrensdefense.org/newsroom/cdf-in-the-news/press-releases/2013/honoring-hillary-clinton.html).
She also found a home-based education system in Israel, and made it happen in Arkansas. 26 states now use this program. [More] (http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/24/hillary-clinton-cites-israel-as-inspiration-for-home-based-education-programs/#)
She has very similar views as Bernie when it comes to Women's healthcare and occupational rights. But wouldn't you want someone making decisions about Women's health coming from an actual woman? [More about Hillary on Women's rights](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/womens-rights-and-opportunity/). 

2. I don't have a source to back this up, so I am open to rebuttal, but having a president as far left as Bernie will result in inevitable gridlock in congress. A Republican congressperson may be more open to one of Hillary's proposals rather than Bernie's. His supporters are driven by the thought of a political revolution, but you cannot revolutionize the political system through executive action. Hillary has a background of working with members of the opposite party to accomplish her goals. [Like the time when she was First-Lady, and she worked with Republican members of congress to create the Children's Health Insurance program, which is still in place today i think?](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/)

3. She was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign. A lot of people got really mad about that, but as a gay man, I see that as a big deal.

4. She is the only candidate that has really addressed the epidemic in our country that is Alzheimer's Disease. She has released a [plan](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/alzheimers-disease/) on her website about taking steps to finding a cure. *This reminds me of Obama's SOTU 2016 when he suggested that 2016 could be the year we curse cancer, and put Joe Biden in charge*

5. She is very similar to Obama. Those on the Republican side believe that a vote for Clinton is a vote for another 4 years of Obama. I believe that sounds great? Obama has his flaws but he is awesome? 

6. Yeah she fucked up with the emails. I can admit that. She fucked up pretty bad. But there is no way anything like that will happen again, *amirite?* she's probably learned her lesson.

7. I am actually an intern on her campaign, so i have had first-hand experience talking to her supporters. The people that I talk to are genuinely nice people. They acknowledge her faults, but chose to support her based on her best qualities like the ones I have listed above. They don't bash Bernie, but honestly believe that Hillary's policies are more realistic. When I look at Bernie's fan base, they tend to focus on Hillary's faults and embrace his strengths. But it has gotten out of hand. Young people are saying that Hillary could be worse than any republican (she's not.) Don't even get me started on the Sanders' circle jerk that is /r/politics. 


I am going to wrap this up now, because I am getting really tired of typing. But if you took anything out of this huge amount of text it would be this:

TL;DR Bernie is great and it's awesome that you support him, but my vision for America is different than yours, so I support Hillary. Can we please stop being dicks to her?"	Haha it's hilarious, and actually pretty sad, that you already assumed that I am a Bernie supporter. I hate that /r/politics is a total Bernie ass kissing festival, I really want to hear other's opinions so I can actually think about why I justify my own and possibly so I can change my views and be better informed. And I totally agree with you and I am well aware that political revolution cannot come from executive action and sadly it seems that most Americans (especially select republicans who blame everything on Obama while we have a Republican dominated congress) believe that the president is basically a king. But I do have to disagree with you about Bernie supporters trashing Hillary and focusing totally on Bernie's strengths. Although it may be true with some (college age liberal redditors [my closed minded peers whom I attempt to distance myself from]) most people in my friend group and family who are Bernie supporters do not believe that Hillary is as bad as any republican. I promise you I prefer her above any of them as much as I believe her mistakes are rather serious. Some of the anger at Hillary that Bernie supporters may possess could  be evident because the Sanders campaign itself is not directly attacking Hillary, resulting in the Sanders supporters simply wanting their opinion of Hillary to be heard.  Anyway thank you for your response, hopefully some day that reddit can become less of a Sanders echo chamber and that people can have reasonable discussions.

I'm super late to the party but I just wanted to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for making the makeup industry a much easier world to navigate. Your site is literally a beacon from a lighthouse in a stormy sea. Your reviews are always so comprehensive and elegantly described- I swear you could write a book or memoir. 
I hope you consider doing just that one day. I'd be first in line to buy it. "

148	czjfnb6	czjfutq	Philippines	"Yes. That is true. But there will always be people trying to remind you that you are alone even if you are fine. Like your family asking who are you dating, your friends jokingly bashing you.

I won't be opening fb that day. Haha. I have an so but something complicated happened so..."	"Oo nga, di talaga yan maiiwasan. Oh well.
Anyway, may magpopost pa rin ng mga vday related stuffs on the 15th, so iwasan mo pa rin ang fb on that day :D"

OH now i realize the issue, i never ported the models to search in the new folders for them. GDI. Fuck it, I aint re-uploading it. I'll just add steps to fix it."
