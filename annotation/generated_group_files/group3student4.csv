2	dgyvzzi	dgyxqum	AskThe_Donald	If we welcome those people and they follow through on those beliefs then they will be tried and sent to prison or deported, whatever the case may be. Natural born citizens also have some crazy ideas on occasion but just because someone wants to kill a black man for marrying a white woman, doesn't mean the law is going to change to allow that. But I don't know just believe what you want and keep voting in line with it. I'm tired.	"This is a Democracy, it only takes %3 to sway an election, we are at %1 now.

But it is far more than that.  Look what happened in Turkey.  Islamists used to be %10 of the population 70 years ago (about the same as France today), now Ergodan, who was voted in Democratically, is firing and imprisoning secular judges and military officials and changing the constitution to make Turkey an Islamic nation.

The Muslim brotherhood itself has a very clear agenda to implement the same thing in the west, and many Imams talk openly about it,including ""outbreeding the infidels"".  

The same thing that happened in Turkey will happen in Europe, and then the gays will be executed legally, as is currently done in the Middle East.."

I agree with everything you said. Imo the ADO events cater towards the recreational dart player and it just so happens some of them are REALLY good at playing darts for American players. 

There might be a few examples that count as ""professional"" but it's fairly rare. I won't name any names but there was a VERY well known US player that won 3 Dartslive events several years ago to the tune of 12 grand each. Plus he had a contract with a Japanese company that was quite lucrative. But that's just a one off example. "	"I started the thread as it was my first tournament setting of any kind. I don't disagree with you at all. We had the same discussion while we were there. It was cool to see the US World Cup Duo (Butler and Young) play since I just watched them a few months ago. Those are the only two I considered pros (semi professional really). I had a lot of fun but you could tell there were a lot of ""shirts"" that weren't that great. I did get destroyed in the singles cricket by a shirt though.

Some people attribute the puffiness to moisture having gotten into the case at some point because tritium expands when it gets wet, but with how good of condition yours is in, I kind of doubt that water has ever gotten in there. I'd seriously doubt it's a re-lume. Does it glow at all? For a watch from the mid 60s, you'd either expect no glow at all, or a very faint glow for a short amount of time.

Thanks! You have a seriously great watch. I'd say wear it. Unless your job is seriously dangerous for watches, I'd go for it. It's a tool watch after all. Best way to enjoy it is on the wrist :)

39		czj8dpo	Aquariums		"This is a Finnex 12x12x12 cube that came with a Planted+ light.  I had this tank set up before, and had issues with algae (the light is strong for the tank, and sits very close to the top.)  
  
I wanted to add some snails to the tank, and wanted a lid to keep them from escaping.  I also wanted to slow evaporation (I have very hard water, and hate the calcium lines I get), and keep the bubbles from the sponge filter from popping and splashing on my monitor.  
  
I went through a couple samples and tests and ended up with this.  It was printed with PET+ (basically same stuff plastic water bottles are made up of) which is hydrophobic - so I'm not too concerned about toxins or breakdown.   Pretty happy with the results.

44	czjf6t5	czjf9u6	DestinyTheGame	"My wish list for the Crucible:

• Double the spawn time of special and heavy. 
• Add just a little more flinch to snipers.
• Reduce aim assist on all snipers.
• Bring Thorn's damage in-line with legendary weapons. The DoT should be what makes it exotic, but it shouldn't do so much extra damage. 
• Bring TLW's damage more in-line with legendary weapons. This thing is way too strong. 4 body shots for a kill, and 2 to the head (hipfire). This thing shoots faster than MIDA and doesn't even require headshots for a fast time to kill. Reduce the extra damage. 
• Since TLW gets bonus damage while hipfiring, shouldn't First Curse at least get some sort of bonus damage while First Curse perk is active? Why can TLW kill someone with max armor in 2 shots, but First Curse can't? (Assuming TLW doesn't get nerfed.)
• High impact auto rifles need crit damage increased. Higher impact autos should have the farthest range as well. 
• Focus Fire perk on high impact autos should make crits at a minimum of 39, and not the current (33).
• High impact pulse rifles should be restored to their former damage. 
• Fusion rifles should be effective outside of shotgun range. I'd say about double the range is good. Tightening stability goes hand to hand with effective range. 

I know it's a pretty ridiculous list, but I think I'd actually be able to enjoy the Crucible if these changes were implemented. We *need* variety. I'm just tired of being killed by the same six weapons every game. TLW, Thorn, MIDA, 1000-Yard, Party Crasher, and Harrowed Quillim's Terminus.

Edit: Of course I get downvoted because nobody agrees with a TLW rebalance. I've been on the receiving end of that weapon for a year now and I can say that I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was already perfectly balanced. "	"I think these are all good except the TLW nerf. It's a shell of its former self, and it just straight up dies outside of, like, twenty feet. I never feel like I've been unfairly killed by it any more. If I get melted, I had it coming.

If it gets nerfed again, it becomes unusable, and I don't think that's necessary."

I sorta wished id planned ahead but it was fun searching whilst knowing I was running out of time.

from the failure list, look for things that you can change most easily and attack those first.

Malkin has been the biggest positive surprise. I wasn't expecting him to be as good as the others but he amazes me! He always seems to be in position, his passing ability is stellar, and he has a surprisingly great shot.

109		czja7dc	LearnJapanese		"So I've found this post about the same topic, discussed from a Japanese speaker's point of view:

http://cpplover.blogspot.jp/2012/12/blog-post_18.html

There's a link to this /r/anime thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14z01e/looking_for_instances_of_an_often_used_quote_that/c7hqldn

Which leads us to this /r/bestof thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14zw76/alayavijnana_explains_the_meaning_behind_the_he/

I don't have the time to read all these posts so here's my answer.

殺す is 'to kill' and 死ぬ is 'to die.'

「彼は殺しても死なない」 literally means ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""  

You will find translations like ""You couldn't kill him if you tried"" because the English sentence I gave above apparently doesn't sound natural.  Literal translation would still be ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""

The Japanese sentence 「彼は殺しても死なない」 is as self-contradictory as ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him"" but somehow feels natural.  In short, I think it's more about what kind of a sentence feels natural rather than the implications of the words 殺す/kill and 死ぬ/die.

I haven't thought this through but this might somehow be related to the ""Japanese doesn't have sarcasm"" trope.   Or I might be completely off the mark.  I must go out now...

117	dkzqhvm	dkzqv1j	AskReddit	"I used to be a guard at a correctional facility. It seems those places just invite creepy things.
When I was training as a runner one night, I was going with my FTO to relieve someone for a break. I had left my water sitting on top of the water cooler in that POD. When we entered the POD, I saw my cup slide off of the water cooler, hang in the air for a split second, and splash onto the ground. I turned and saw my FTO who looked unnerved, so I asked him if he saw that? He told me, ""I didn't see shit, Dude."" He refused to talk about it after that.
One time when I was a runner for the building our isolation unit was in, I heard the bars shaking in one of the units. It was after lockdown, so I was a little perturbed by this inmate making noise. So, I pulled my keys, unlocked the cell, and saw the bars shaking, but the inmate cowering in the corner crying. After a couple of seconds, the bars stopped shaking. I hung out with the inmate for a while calming him down. I made up some bs about how we had water pipes that were causing the bars to shake. Unfortunately, that cell was pretty notorious for being ""haunted."" 
Finally, me and several other runners were called out to search the building for someone who was seen entering our visitation lobby around 11:30 pm. I checked the only doors going into the lobby and they were fully secured. We searched for a good 30 minutes, even climbing into the false ceiling, and never found a person matching the description given."	That's crazy stuff! Thanks for sharing.

Hence the **point** of gradual ban time increase. idk how many times I have to explain myself. seems like the only ones being stuck up are the ones that have crashing problems. you guys should spend more time coming up with a fix and mess time arguing this great ban idea 	"I only said you seem like a prick because you're asking ""what is wrong with you people,"" as if we are at fault for not wanting people to be unfairly banned. 

This just isn't a good idea. You have to attack the problem at it's core. Rage quitters are not the issue you are trying to address here. It is salty/toxic players. 

For example, you miss a save. Your teammate ""what a saves"" you and votes to forfeit. You don't vote and so he just leaves. That player is clearly willing to give up 15 minutes. If we include some time of increasing time length ban and that person then isn't willing to give up 2 hours (or whatever) of time, in all likelihood they're just gonna stay and be toxic. Play against you. Drive around aimlessly. Talk trash in chat etc. Is that any better than if they had just rage quit? You have to understand that if someone who doesn't want to play is forced to play, in most cases they aren't really gonna try to play productively and win. Additionally, we can't forget about what will happen to all the people who have an unfortunate week of power outages, wifi drops game crashes etc, and are suddenly hit with an hour long ban even though they never rage quit once.

There's nothing wrong with pitching a new idea. But you shouldn't be so agressive against others when they suggest to you reasons why your idea wouldn't work."
