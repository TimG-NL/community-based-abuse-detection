Subaki is also the most viable lance unit you've mentioned, throw Iote's shield on him and he becomes an excellent physical tank on flier emblem team, allowing you to bait enemy archers into positions where your other units can gank them safely.

8		dgyyves	WRX		I didn't price a limited, but the dealers that I visited weren't hesitant to immediately drop the price well below sticker on a base/premium to get me to the OTD price that I asked for. One thing you could do is get an ambassador from /r/Subaru or from various Facebook posts to give you one of the $500 off coupons if your dealer will honor it. If you signed paperwork stating that you will buy the car at a specific price, you're kind of hooked unless you want to lose out on your deposit.

That said there are *literally* hundreds of thousands of fun games that will run perfectly on them. You just aren't going to get the same experience you do from a dedicated gaming PC or laptop.

My advice to gamers who want an SP4 is to find different kinds of games for it than you would expect to play on your gaming rig. Looking at my steam library I can see at least 20 great games that would run perfectly on any model SP4 and that's just what I've got installed.

They're an awesome device for certain things and it's great that they *can* run some games... I just feel like way too many people bought one expecting some kind of mobile gaming beast and are now disappointed. "	"This. Tons of awesome small/indie/older games out there.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Don't get me wrong, I did 70 with terrible Rathma (zero ancients), and I used the blood-sucking Simul necklace to do it (I got my hellfire later).

I struggle to survive certain elites on 60+ with my Rathma gear and I'm 9/14 ancient (and 1/9, the weapon, is primal!).  It's down to how much damage they do, how they do it, and so on.  It's more about placement and tactics at this level.

The Pledge set will help you deal damage and survive a bit, but it isn't the be all and end all.  Granted, I come from playing insanely fragile wizards, and insanely fragile Crusader LoN builds, so maybe it just bothers me less.  Try to use your command skeletons to soak some damage if you need to, and try using the two-piece weapon set to bolster it (and keep your essence burn down).

107		dkzrynu	Parenting		Echoing what others have said that you may want to consider going back to work and letting the twins go to daycare. There's a lot that they can learn from daycare, and there's a lot that you can gain from going to a job. If work isn't an option, you could look at a Mother's Day Out kind of thing a day or so a week to run errands, pamper yourself, clean house, and just feel normal. Use this time to find something fulfilling for you. Being a mom is amazing, but it's not the only way to define yourself.

128	dkzhbrb	dkzte6o	RadicalChristianity	"> We are using liberal in the sense of liberal democracy, economic liberalism, etc.

Oh, I am very aware of the long and complicated of what is ""liberal"".  So, given that this  history is long and complicated and that the word ""liberal"" we should be very careful about how we use it.  We need to respect that this word is used by people to self-identify.  People say ""I am a liberal"", or ""I voted Liberal, go Justin Trudeau!"" or ""I am a liberal theologian"" or even ""my Christianity is a liberal Christianity"".  So, when u/Demon_Nietzsche says he is ready to delete ""liberal garbage"", it becomes an attack on all who have ""liberal"" as part of their self-identity.  Would we allow a moderator to post, ""I am going to delete all feminist garbage"" from the subreddit?  No, we would rightly see this as a sexist attack against women."	"Ah yes, liberals, those oppressed masses without wage parity, subject to domestic violence and barred from full participation in contemporary society because of the genitalia they were born with.

**Won't someone think of the LIBERALS?**"

132	dgvwfww	dgyu3na	KansasCityBeer	"Glad you dig Magic Magic! This is Rafi, Torn Label Brewing co-owner. There's a couple different factors that OP and other commenters have alluded to which contribute to the reasons we're not able to brew that beer year-round:

- Ingredient pricing: Magic Magic is one of if not our most expensive beers to brew. The hops (primarily Mosaic) as well as the raspberry and lemon peel are all culprits here. An in-demand hop like Mosaic can easily sell for 4-5x the price per pound as an (equally as tasty IMO but less sexy) hop like Columbus (which we use in an everyday beer like Alpha Pale). And that's if you can find it, which leads me to . . . 

- Ingredient availability: Many hops, such as Mosaic, Citra or Galaxy, we use in our once-a-year offerings but not regularly because they're near-impossible to obtain on contract as a new brewery but if you're vigilant and patient, you can at some point in the year find them on the spot market. Now that we've been around a couple years, we're fortunate enough to have a few of them on contract, but typically we can only contract for small-ish amounts of those varieties due to availability and the aforementioned price point issue.

- ""Keeping it limited to drive hype"" is not a factor in our decision making process but concerns about its increased availability ARE, if that makes sense. As amazing as the response to Magic Magic in limited distribution has been, that's not necessarily a guarantee of high demand once a product hits another echelon of production, and if that doesn't end up being the case it would be a costly mistake for us to make, to say the least. Beyond the costs related to hops and adjuncts that I mentioned, there is also the issue that because Magic is a once-a-year release we utilized shrink sleeve cans rather than painted cans (as we use on year-round beers Alpha Pale, House Brew and Monk & Honey), which allows us to bring in lower minimums. If we made Magic Magic a year-round beer we would have to switch to painted cans, which requires us to pre-order nearly a year's supply of cans, so making that switch is not something we can take lightly.

- In my view, NE style IPAs tend to have a shorter shelf life than West Coast IPAs and you see aroma and flavor degradation swiftly. Even with Magic being an extremely sought-after, it's inevitable that we do see sporadic cans or even a stray 1/6 bbl that sticks around longer than is healthy for that beer, and making that product more consistently would inescapably exacerbate that problem. We are inordinately concerned with freshness, and generally speaking we would rather make less of a product and have it run out quickly than make a bit more than we needed to and as a result have it suffer in quality if it doesn't sell through as quick as we'd like.

- This is a bit sillier and less rooted in practicalities, but part of what makes a lot of once-a-year/occasional releases enjoyable is the ephemeral nature of the beer: it feels fun and special right now when Magic time rolls around, and as much as myself and others would dig drinking it all year round, it would inevitably feel less special that way.

Hope all that makes sense and answers your question! Even though Magic Magic won't return until next spring, we do have two new NE IPAs that will see limited distribution in cans later in 2017."	God damn. That's the best response ever. Thanks for that, and for making good quality, honest beer.

134		dgz2f1n	FFBraveExvius		"Not bad idea but ATK is the measure of physical damage and MAG is now turning into the measure of magical and hybrid damage so ATK+MAG feels pretty distant (for high SPR and low DEF target, probably best to max ATK instead of max both) and not that generally useful (i.e. ATK+MAG+DEF isn't that useful for most units/most fights).

I would find ATK+DEF, ATK+SPR, ATK+DEF+SPR, etc more useful.

I would find ""eHP"" more useful for ranking of tanks: https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/68fubm/hp_and_defspr_calculation_which_should_you_focus/
