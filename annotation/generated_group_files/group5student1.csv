0		czjayls	Frugal		"please do supplement your food by taking advantage of community meals! generally food stamps cover fresh stuff (fruit, produce, meat/fish) and stuff that you need to expend effort to prepare (frozen fried chicken, yes; fried chicken from the deli counter that is cheaper, no)

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

edit: wanted to add that if you can arrange with someone to get mail at their place, do it. It's really hard to get a new job (or other benefits) with no address."

9	czj8br0	czj9vsu	Vive	I don't think Oculus will release the pricing for the Touch anytime soon. They learned their lesson about not releasing pricing early, as they got a ton of backlash for the $600 Rift. I also hear they're having a lot of problems getting the Touch technology to work because of connectivity issues and extremely low battery life which may pose an issue even a year from now and may affect the pricing, which is another reason they probably won't disclose the price ahead of time. But I am pretty sure it won't be less than $200 because it includes a whole other camera (which I hear they're also having issues with) and two controllers. I'd imagine it might even cost up to $300. Vive is seriously your best bet.	Don't get me wrong I want a Vive it just depends on how much it costs up front. I don't see the camera being that much on the touch, it's a camera ya know? They are pretty cheap these days. I hadn't heard about the tracking issues but if so that's a definite issue that would change my opinion. I'm just afraid Vive is going to come out over $1k and if that's the case I'll definitely go rift.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.  

It's also not saying good or bad.  It's just saying, I don't think 5% guaranteed annual rate of return."
36		dkzs1df	FORTnITE		I played on PC since the Alpha and it acts as my main account but I also have friends on xbox to play with so I purchased it again. Similar thing happened, I played for a few days and finally got an error message when logging in via Xbox and when I went back to PC it wouldn't let me in either. The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days. The whole making you go through the tutorial again I didn't have to deal with so that sounds scary.... I don't know if my fix will help with you... but if it does, yay?

38		dkztdu2	Entrepreneur		"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."

2) to cover, my process is first find midi versions of the song, and load them into a daw. Identify the imoortant/memorable parts of the song, and delete the rest. Make an arrangement that will work on the POs limited polyphony and number of patterns. Take advantage that you can repeat patterns if possible. Dont try to make a note for note cover. Instead, make a ""caricature"" of the song.

In many cases, entrepreneurs will make bad long term decisions in order to chase a tax break. Lots of companies will relocate operations to sub-optimal places in order to attract a one off tax subsidy. Think of how much time NFL team owners spend trying to lobby for a subsidy. Right now, Apple is sitting on a huge pile of overseas cash and is simultaneously borrowing money in order to issue dividends because the foreign cash is taxable while the interest payments on the debt are tax deductible!

We want companies to think about how to maximize profits, not thinking about how to minimize their tax bills.

We know that inefficient tax gaming happens for individuals. Look at how many people buy a house ""for tax purposes"" or choose a poorly performing 401K plan because they get an upfront tax deduction. *Many* people put money into a flexible spending account only to lose those funds the next year because they didn't spend enough on health care in time."

They could practice this same stuff much better if they moved closer and alternated attacking and defending. That way they could get real practice applying the technique (because you actually have to block a real strike that could land on you, which also gives you instant feedback if you fail to block it) as well as practicing timing and speed.	Right, but then that's another exercise altogether.

I'm glad to hear it. Then ask him or others in your church how you can deepen your relationship with Jesus. They'll know you far better than we do. And if they *don't* know you better, deepening relationships with others in your church is one good way of deepening your relationship with Jesus.

Thanks for your input. I'm really struggling here. If they have a medical issue then I really want to help them or at least not make things worse.

However, on the other hand, I've been bitten too many times because I have a tendency to take people on face value and believe what they say... I've been conned too many times because of this.

If they're deliberately being shits, I don't want to cooperate with them :("	Honestly, if they do have OCD, ordering your life around their disorder is bad for them in the long run.  People with OCD tend to get worse as they order their lives more and more around their compulsions.  The best thing you can probably do is offer to talk to them about it, and if they don't want to discuss it then just ask them to mind their own business when it comes to how you organize your own stuff.  Not much else you can do, really.

106		czjdywj	Rivenmains		"I was so excited towards the amount of feedback I got towards my noobish questions :) for those too lazy to read I'll post the overall answers to my questions, although I highly recommend you do read all the feedback as there's a lot of good information in here and I could have accidentally left something out.

1. Black cleaver is a great item for the cdr and utility and you should probably build it every game. In the early game, you sacrifice a little bit of dmg compared to ghostblade but you should still be able to win lane with bc. The health will keep you alive esp vs true dmg opponents and 20% cdr is a ton. Can also buy a tiamat in between there if you feel you need more dmg. BC also helps transfer riven into the mid game.

2. Spirit Visage is still a viable option as it is gold efficient and offers really good components. However Maw and Scim are most often times going to be the way you want to go. The AD and MR offered by Maw is huge not to mention Moar armor pen, and the passive will give you more sustain than SV however you have to reach low health for it. Scimitar is also useful with the QSS tons of AD and lifesteal.

3. Although it definitely makes sense, it was a little surprising that everyone had the same exact answer of early hexdrinker vs ap match ups. SO DO IT

4. Deadmans is good for vsing a team without a lot of crit, and the moves peed passive is good on riven and helps with flanking. Randuins is good for the crit Champs like Yasuo, trynda, and some ADC aoe slow is really nice too.

5. This guy is still not someone you really wanna fight. I'd definitely recommend reading all the posts for this one but basically you want to kill him pre 6. Nidalee posted the build of BC&gt;Lifeel steal item&gt; Lord Dominik's Regard (LW)&gt;life steal item with lucidity somewhere in there. Try to roam.

6. It's more of preference. I personally like mid because most of your apponents are squishy but will often have cc to lock you down. Again hexdrinker is good here and QSS for Champs like Annie or Tf. Jungle riven is doable and fast Qing the minions is how u do it. However you should look to get rolling early as you fall off if you dont.

107	czj4l3j	czj4sy4	MapPorn	Are there any blacks-only, Coloured-only, or Asian-only towns in South Africa? I know the Bantustans were supposed to be monolingual black-only territories, but they were explicitly the product of apartheid.	There are many blacks-only and coloured-only towns but not on purpose. These towns simply haven't had any non-blacks or non-coloureds move into them. Orania and Kleinfontein are intentionally whites-only. If you're looking for examples: here's the town of [Bullettrap](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/364006) - a 100% coloured town in the Northern Cape and here's the town of [Allandale](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/276132) - 100% black. I have never found a 100% Asian town in South Africa, because, like Whites, they are never a majority in any municipality and therefore when apartheid ended a lot of non-Asians moved into their areas because they were of a better economic standing. Very few whites have, for example, moved into Soweto or Tembisa because they're usually from a better economic background and Soweto is generally poor

115	czivtte	czj9aan	AskReddit	"my husband is 240 lb, and he's strong and very muscular underneath the fat because of his job, but he's still fat.  he's always been fat as long as i've known him.  he's got the beer gut, the man titties, the jelly rolls.

i'm 110 lb.

honestly, he's hot.  he doesn't have to be a skinny doe-eyed model to be hot.  his look and his style is... really good.  being fat is honestly part it.  that's ok.

i can speak for any skinny person porking with a fat person when i say, if you love the person, you're gonna love the body.  if you don't love the person, you're just there for the body, and if the body isn't your cup of tea, why the hell are you there in the first place.  my guess is that fat women will put every effort into their appearance and being sexually pleasing to try to ""make up"" for being fat.  but again, if you love the person, you're going to love the body.  they shouldn't have to make up for it at all in a loving relationship.

i can say for the record, my SO never ""retains"" body odor when he washes up, and doesn't have a bad odor to begin with.  different people have different hygiene habits, fat and skinny alike.  i can't speak for fat women, but fat men can be a great fuck.  they have a lot of thrusting power behind the d.  just had sex an hour ago and i'm a happy camper.  high five!"	Very well spoken. It always worries me when someone focuses on the physical attributes of someone they have been in a relationship with. Sure its important for attracting attention, but looks shouldn't be the basis for a whole relationship.

With rest and time it can become less painful. A few days is recommended. Williams hasn't practiced in TWO months. Clearly, the conservative method isn't working."

Mayo clinic is a well known resource and the fact you called it a vague link makes me skeptical your wife is anything at all.

Natural 5's can come from heroic for sure. Not sure about heart summons. But they probably do too. Basics can only go for 1-4 stars IIRC.

On natural vs fused, naturals have generally higher stats than fused, hence why they are stronger. You'll see this once you get to compare your first natural and fused. You are guaranteed a natural 5 start in a month of playing.
