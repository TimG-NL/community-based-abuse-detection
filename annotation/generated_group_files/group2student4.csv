1	dkztc5x	dkztrvd	AskReddit	"I guess I'm a little different there but I totally understand it. I can definitely spend longer periods by myself, but if I'm in the house for more than a couple days I get really antsy and then need to go outside. If there is any sort of big outdoor project I've got going on, I can definitely stay on my property alone as long as I can be active outside.

"	I'll go outside in the backyard often, unless it's winter, and just hang out with my dogs. And I enjoy going out and doing things, going to the library, the coffee shop near my house, the farmers market, or even the mall, but I can be perfectly content just being at the house.  Dealing with people can be exhausting, especially when it's ride or stupid people haha. 
2	dgz1102	dgz2dso	EliteDangerous	Small ships only sounds shit. And the amount of time in between each date is huge. 2 days to travel 500 light years? That's doable in 15 minutes. 	"The goal behind having small ships only is twofold: 1 is a very affordable expedition so many new players can easily join in, and 2 is to provide an interesting alternative to the traditional ""aspaconda"" expeditions. It gives a challenge to people to try and engineer their ass off with the small ships. It was a huge success last year (we had over 300 people register when we were expecting 50), and was a real blast. Sometimes quite literally."
3	dkzk4o3	dkzne0e	MLBTheShow	Yeah I was civil with the guy but he's making me out to be a dick. I'll post the convo here for you guys shortly :) It's easy to go on the internet and complain about the guy when he's not here. 	In the messages that you posted it showed everything that I said. I said you were not answering my question about the game being broken 4 months after release because you're one of SDS's favorite streamers. Your messages proved that. All the other messages are just your word against mine, what you saw versus what I saw. I don't give a shit if you're here now or not. I stand by the fact that you have to say nice things about SDS so they can take care of you

5	dkzpr1z	dkzsdzm	Android	You might want to give a bit more info than that? What specifically didn't you like about the OP5 reviews?	"The complaints that turned me off the most were with OnePlus not the phone itself. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with. In addition, the customer support is shotty, but that can be anecdotal although it still does worry me. The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much. 

All in all, I am just trying to shop around for comparable phones and was wondering if there was something similar or more powerful than the OP5 whether the price is higher or not."

I think my problem is that the game is just like ""play ranger classes!!"" because it keeps giving me the good ranger (earth) cards but on Warrior I only have Titan for AoE BDD and the Air AoE MT and otherwise basically Squat... "	I used a turtle/turtle build suggested by FawksB. One deck was a knight with buff and heal cards, the otger was paladin with an attack card, Lillith and two support cards (I think). The key to the build is Lillith. It's the bio card and and it's your main source of damage. Be warned that this build takes a long time but it's safe.

37	dgycgre	dgys7fk	Bestbuy	"Am I the only one who thinks these accommodations are BS? Like, last year, you just printed off a coupon and only once they were all used (or mostly used, I suspect) was the coupon pulled. Now they put up X (1,000 in this instance, apparently) coupons via the Learning Network, and once those are ""claimed"" the offer is gone. And yet, 800 of those people may never use the coupon. 

Last years Samsung Accom lasted for like *four or five months*. This one lasted for like four or five *hours* (well... ten hours, but still). \*facepalm\*"	Yes it is bs because with only 1,000 coupons and 1,026 stores there are entire stores that didn't get even one. I thought that the point of the accommodations program was to allow employees to have better knowledge of and experience with the products that they sell. So how are we going to get that real world knowledge when only 0.8% of all the employees nationwide have a shot at a coupon?
38	czba7se	czj6ui0	MakingaMurderer	"The problem with this theory is the profile and psychology behind Steven Avery. Killers fall into two main categories (which of course are broken down further but these are the two main differences) of organized and disorganized. This theory has SA organized one moment, and disorganized the next and switches his profile several times. 

SA is a man with an IQ in the 70's, highly disorganized as seen in his home and workplace, and has never shown any of the planning and awareness of an organized killer. 

This theory has him cleaning the gun and placing it back into it's original place,  cleaning up blood, DNA and other forensic evidence, using plastic sheeting, removing his fingerprints, being in full control in a kidnapping and he is able to fully burn a human body knowing exactly how long and what type of fire he needs. This shows SA as organized and intelligent. 

However at other times during this theory we have him bleeding all over her car and not worrying about it which shows he also wasn't wearing gloves, he decides to place the body and car on his own property even after having her in another remote off-site location, he throws keys and a license plate in a random place instead of disposing of them properly, and he leaves her spare key on the bedroom floor of his trailer. 

To make this theory fit, you have to change SA's way of thinking and personality as well as his intelligence and skill level. It just isn't plausible that at one moment he is cleaning a crime scene and the murder weapon, and the next he leaves a body in the backyard and leaves blood all over her vehicle. 

And before the arguments of who knows why killers do the things they do, or that killers are dumb and make mistakes, I do agree with this. However profiling and criminal psychology are powerful tools in investigating and forensics, and this theory just doesn't fit SA's profile. 

Also I didn't see where this theory explained the spare key on the bedroom floor or the fact that her body could not have been burned in the fire-pit. Even if you believe it was, it doesn't fit with much of the theme of an organized killer or a killer who would move her bones, as no killer would move the bones to a more obvious and persecuting location. 

Tl;DR - Steven Avery can not be Dexter Morgan one minute, and a bumbling idiot the next. 

Edit: I also want to add using his past crimes to build a profile to debunk this theory. In none of his other crimes he was convicted of (ignoring the rape for obvious reasons) he never tried to destroy or hide evidence, nor was he able to hide and food law enforcement. He never showed this sort of planning and intelligence that would be required for this theory to work. If SA did murder someone, it would be very sloppy and very obvious what he had done, and he would not be able to go for so long without slipping up and either admitting his guilt or saying something that led to his guilt. "	He may have been disorganized but tried to cover his tracks as best he could. Which is to say he left a lot of incriminating evidence. Especially, the body remains just outside his house.

64		dkzvadk	SquaredCircle		"John Cena - Superman with years of experience being the heart of American values.  
  
Bayley - Supergirl with zero experience and getting her butt kicked by the villains left and right.  
  
She doesn't know her cousin is also here on Earth yet, but when she finally comes face-to-face with him and competes in a mixed tag match, she's going to awaken and become just as strong.  
  
Where's Powergirl, though?..."
65		dgyv4t5	CringeAnarchy		Jesus christ. Such a fascinating stance.
66	dkzorwy	dkzqol5	BrasildoB	Do jeito que eles falam, parece que até o Foro de Sao Paulo tem mais agentes, recursos e interesses para atuar em toda a América latina que os EUA. Vai entender.	Os caras falam como se a USSR ainda tivesse viva enviando tropa e equipamentos pro maduro
67	czisywl	czj8oxq	ModestMouse	Has anyone ever been to Chastain? I saw online that the pit usually has chairs set up. Do you think they will for this?	I really hope they won't.  The listings online show rows and seats even for the pit though.
68	dgz1zxl	dgz24ym	Nerf	1-6 are my favorites	1-6 will always be my fav 
69	czis7ib	czjfv3e	Philippines	Thank you for these tips! As far as the mountains go, would I be able to go hiking or anything?	When going for hikes, I suggest you ask to go with your relatives or at least with a local know/trust. You will be priced with a foreigner rate when locals see you guys on your own. You'll be welcomed with the Filipino hospitality
70	czjepfg	czjeq2m	KotakuInAction	"That shit was everywhere, hell it caused the mod team here at the time to change Rule 1 from saying ""dick parade"" to ""dickwolf""."	I thought that was because of Penny-Arcade who came up with the term in the first place.
71		czjd50x	GlobalOffensiveTrade		sent for awp asiimov 
72		dkzw0yf	AskReddit		Nobody's gonna see this but FUCK the wily's last form in Mega Man 7.
73	dgyvier	dgyzu21	GenderCritical	He's a men's rights activist. He yells at women on the internet like it's a full time job because he can't get laid, just downvote and move on honey	Lol.
74		dkzp4ni	PrequelMemes		*yup
75		dgyt1hn	OnceUponATime		What's Emma's tattoo on her wrist? Is it a crescent?
76		dkzund3	AndroidTV		"Hope this works.   They are infrared, I was incorrect about the pairing. Sorry.

77	czj8yj3	czj9t5e	AskReddit	He wasn't exactly the brightest star in the tool shed, that one.	"Yeah, but I guess I mean more in general. When people say ""my buddy this..."" or ""my buddy that..."" have to know that people can see through the BS."
78	czj9jvg	czja84k	SandersForPresident	"Hillary up to dirty tricks already.  Here is the primary concern:

> Weaver fretted about the possibility they are having non-residents attempt to participate and be counted in the caucus."	I wonder if this is an actual threat. The Clinton campaign accused the Sanders campaign of the same thing.
79		dkzsf0u	NYYankees		If I'm Ellsbury I pop Miggy right in his fat f'n head.
80	czh8vwx	czjgovm	GRE	How much were you thinking?	$75, which is cheaper than buying it from them, and it lasts until June, so you can resell it after you're done with it for most of that value.
81	dgyzzp7	dgz1rw1	DBZDokkanBattle	Good info. What about anything regarding Mono Super or Mono Extreme?	"Only stuff on Hero teams

https://www.reddit.com/r/DBZDokkanBattle/comments/68erkx/analysis_jpn_hero_teams/?st=J25L84TT&amp;sh=4359b2a6
"
82	dgz0q3b	dgz0tds	Bowling	Yeah the Sure Lock replaced the Alpha Crux as the sanded solid asym in the Storm lineup.	Ok, cool. I've got a Code Black and was wondering since it's a polished asym, if a Dare Devil trick would work well as a heavy oil ball. My Code Black is flawless once the lanes start breaking down, but tends to skid on the fresh sometimes a little too much. 
83	dkzio3p	dkzq3vk	Boat_Building	hmm....  If you have your patterns, try taking some 3/4 inch dowel rod (or other small scrap) and cutting it to the beam length at each station (measured from your pattern), then wedge the dowel at the appropriate location to spread the hull.  it might take a small amount of sand paper between the rod and the hull for friction so it wont slip out, also might try some hot glue hold the rod in place.  best I got for ya.	Yeah, I figured that's what I would end up doing. I just wanted to see if anyone had some other ideas. I appreciate the input.
84	czj4o25	czj6lt4	SquaredCircle	So is their anyway to watch Lucha legally if you don't have El Rey? other than Sling? though I'm starting to think paying 20 bucks a month for Lucha Underground alone is worth it.	Reports from this weekend's tapings are saying that it's coming to iTunes later this year.
85		czj75xa	megamemecast		HELL YES!
86	dgylttu	dgywi4m	MechanicalKeyboards	I'm wondering, do you actually use all those thumb keys? It looks like apart from the two vertical ones in each cluster, the rest are pretty much out of reach for your thumb.	"As somebody who's been using a Kinesis Advantage for 17+ years, I will say that those thumb cluster keys are all very much within reach. It's my biggest complaint about my ErgoDox's flat layout – that the outermost keys are very difficult to reach.

I haven't built my Dactyl yet, but I'm looking forward to using it once it's finished."
87	czjai2k	czjap7m	AskReddit	"Do you have Aldis near you? They have awesome cheap produce. Good quality. If you don't like it you can return it and they will refund you (did this with a bag of oranges-they were dry and fibrous inside). For protein, I love to get the markdown stuff. The meat or fish that's got a ""sell by"" date of ""today"". As long as you cook it same day or freeze it immediately it's perfectly good. I also take advantage of coupons/special offers for specialty items. I just got $100 free groceries for transferring some prescriptions to my local supermarket."	Whaaat you can return your produce? That's awesome. I would love to have an Aldis nearby but they're nowhere near us
88		dgyvic6	NoMansSkyTheGame		Mod? 
89	dgz0dka	dgz0e9z	Diepio	Inb4 flair is changed to *Old barber*	lol
90		czj8098	BravoRealHousewives		What?!?! Cynthia sold Kenya down the river 
91		czjei24	ResearchMarkets		Thanks!
92	dkyoutx	dkzuj97	Flipping	[verwijderd]	500 isn't that impressive, but I dig a robust supply of significant digits /s
93	dkz5jjz	dkzqg56	AskMen	"That everything you have in a specific place in your house, is in the wrong place. Plates? Nah they should be in this cabinet. This one particular pan? It should be in this cabinet away from all the other pans. 

I've lived in this house for 5 years, and every single day I have to look for something that's in a place it's never been before. "	"Do you get any say in this?  If not, why not?  Is this a ""pick your battles"" thing?  If so, have you noticed that her ""win"" in this carried over to other situations?"
94	dgyubin	dgyujy2	AnaheimDucks	"OH MY FUCKING GOD EVEN THE INTERMISSION SHOW IS MCDAVID BLOWJOB HOUR.

"	"https://i.imgur.com/UcxUGsp.jpg


I went through a lot of work for this picture so
You better f wording appreciate it."
95	czin19q	czjfo9e	AskReddit	"Wear sunscreen.

Edit: It makes me so happy that so many people got the reference!"	Sunscreen is actually really bad for you.  It's better to cover up.   
96	dkzu6ht	dkzu9r4	Mariners	Gamel :(	He'll get one more AB, unless a DP happens here, and the M's are retired in order to end the game. If this happens, deleting my account.
97		czj7idr	TroveCreations		Looks good but the tip of the sword needs to be facing you when you load it. Also you need to set an attachment point on the handle marked by a magenta single voxel. This is hex value #ff00ff or RGB value 255, 0, 255. You should also become familiar with the material maps you can make stuff look better with them.
98	dgykzeq	dgyxhew	MSAccess	"In the query design, you know the line between tables which represents the join between them. If you double click on that line it will show you the properties for that join. In the bottom half you see three options. The first option, which is selected by default requires matching entries in both tables. If you have a table whose entries are optional then you should select either option 2 or 3, as appropriate to your table layout.

That allows you to bring back all values from one table and just the matching ones from the other table.

I think that should resolve your problem."	I was totally unaware of these settings. Thank you so much, it worked great!! 
99		dkzqa02	AskReddit		"fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. 

or vanilla"
100	dgypq01	dgyvq6u	RocketLeagueExchange	Cobalt Zombas + 3 Keys for Hexed?	nty
101		czj66m5	AsianBeauty		WHAT.  That is adorable. 
102	cziwy88	czje2kx	CFB	Williams, Benn, Mendenhall. God, I wish Mendenhall had come back for his senior year.	The Juice!
103		dkzxqyg	Sneakers		Check out Kodiaks! They're awesome for the fall/winter, and are really well-priced for the quality. Check em out... www.kodiakboots.ca/en/lifestyle-boots/mens-boots/
104	dgxgaig	dgyzze1	ClashRoyale	"And put an ""IMPOSSIBLE!"""	Dont forget the classic (GONE WRONG)
105		czj8g22	Rateme		"We now require all new submissions to include a photo verifying the consent of the person being rated. Please include at least one photo in your submission of you holding a handmade sign that says /r/RateMe and your exact reddit username. Once that's done, the thread will be approved. Thanks.

"
106		dkzr4fx	AsianBeauty		This is highly promising work, even if it might still take some years to materialise - patching holes in organs is vastly different from fixing skin problems. Is that how snail slime fix our skin problems though? Patching things up so that injured or inflamed skin can heal?
107		dkzveat	The_Donald		Are you suggesting she has a certain unhealthy appetite for pizza?
108	czj9ggz	czj9o8o	CampHalfBloodRP	"""I have a guess at that something."""	"""Yeah?"""
109	dgyvedi	dgyx7ns	AskReddit	That's really stretching the definition of alive.	He's Phoenixperson!
110		dgyvk16	SquaredCircle		Surprised Charlotte wasn't the first one to win both titles. Also this subreddit is fucking pathetic when it comes to women's matches.
111	dkznjw7	dkzv1xm	Accounting	"There is no argument: the stock is *not* valued for performance. It trades at between 140-190 times trailing earnings, which is absolutely insane to me. I just don't see the growth opportunities. Their largest costs are developing their own shows, and those costs are only going to increase.

I agree they have an incredible network and the disruption they've brought to the table is noteworthy, but I just don't see them as a great value long term. Netflix doesn't have any capabilities outside of its core business, and to me there is no huge distinction between the value Netflix provides in its original content versus that provided by Hulu and Amazon.

I find myself using Hulu more and more nowadays, and Amazon has the advantage of rolling a ton of value into the prime membership, versus Netflix offering you a very narrow service.

I don't think Netflix is a bad company and I use and enjoy their service. I just think that they are insanely inflated in value."	But fang...
112		dkzwosc	Fraudnet2		Just to make sure
113		dgyv583	ClashRoyale		Y r u doing an AMA 
114		dkzo0ws	Dell		Everything that says dell in front of it 
115	dgse3fz	dgyvxhx	Justridingalong	The pedals might be the most valuable thing on it.	Is that an old school Salsa stem? Might be worth a few bucks for a retro build.
116	dgyxmmx	dgyxzqs	SkincareAddiction	Do you know if this is meant for everyday use? Thanks so much!	I would be comfortable using all the products every day for sure.
117		czjd77b	Fitness		Get some propor custom orthotics. it will make a world of difference
118		dkzyenz	TalesFromTheFrontDesk		"I use a program called Guest Centrix. Never heard of it before I started my current job.

Pros?

Nice to look at I guess. Simple visual design.


Cons:

It's a peice of crap. To view the following day's arrivals takes 10 mouse clicks and there's no way to bookmark that screen so if I get interrupted I gotta click another 10 times to get back to it. Just very inefficient software that also freezes and crashes way too often.        "
119	czj6xy7	czjgfhp	TeamSolomid	This shit will not happen during summer when we get BO3s. Thank god.	Assuming we have better draft by then.
120	dgysblq	dgysq7y	DotA2	this is a pretty good cosplay but reading the title i was hoping you were a chick with big boobs seeking attention and now im sad	I'm sorry about that but I've been told there are many other places on the internet to find those sorts of pictures. Best of luck in your search 
121	dgz076a	dgz1g86	AskReddit	I think The Silmarillion is more like Tolkien's cover of a phonebook. 	I don't remember very many elven kings challenging dark lords to single combat in the phonebook, though. Admittedly, it's been a while since I flipped through it.
122		dkzoel5	Music		"Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash "" - "", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)

123	czj6ifd	czjbp4e	magicTCG	"Hellbent sees play in Legacy ([[Infernal Tutor]]).

Mechanics live or die based on the cards printed with them. Landfall was printed with a lot of very strong cards in ZEN and so became a player favorite. The mechanically similar Constellation was only printed 2 years ago and everyone has already forgotten it existed, because there were no good cards with it.

Fateful Hour was always going to struggle to be relevant, however, as going to 5 is so dangerous."	To be fair, the decks that run Infernal Tutor also use LED.
124		dkzre27	BravoRealHousewives		Maybe get your top lips tightened instead, Kelly!
125	dkz3bp7	dkzob69	AskReddit	I had a friend in high school that carried a liter of chocolate milk around with him everywhere. Pretty sure that's all he ever drank.	I had a guy like that too... He also ate really smelly foods in the middle of class as well.

"	"&gt; I believe she is the only candidate with the knowledge and experience to continue President Obama's great work.

She is married to a former President-- that doesn't mean she has any executive experience. 

She was a 1.5 term Senator from NY (carpetbagger!) and literally accomplished nothing. 

She's perhaps the worst Secretary of State in modern history. 

What is the great ""knowledge and experience"" that you think she has?

132	dgyxois	dgz0ptu	Guitar	Almost, I found [this](https://streamable.com/8ci7p) webm on /wsg/ and stayed for the tea.	"K-On! is honestly a big reason I decided to finally pick up the instrument. I had wanted to learn for years but always let myself be convinced that I was too old to start learning. I'd always been involved with the chapel band at my school (private Christian school) as a vocalist and watching that show brought back lots of memories of being in a ""band"". After finishing the show, I decide if a klutz like Yui could pick up the instrument, so could I. I've been playing for about a year and a half now but only started taking lessons with a good teacher about four months ago. I'm progressing and am excited about the prospect of writing my own material. Vocals were always somewhat easy for me but now that I'm gaining another tool, music is a whole new thing for me. Also, for anyone curious, I'm 20, going on 21 this year. Never too old to start."

People like to list their MBTI because it's four letters you can get from an internet test that supposedly encapsulates your personality.
