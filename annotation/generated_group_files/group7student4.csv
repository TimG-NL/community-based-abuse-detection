9	dgy2l8u	dgyu8ei	AskAnAmerican	Go into more detail, please. I know it's anecdotal, but I don't run across people with anecdotal experience of two systems very often.	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."

17		dgytefr	Vive		"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."

73		czjetfo	Drugs		"Alcohol and marijuana are completely different for me. 

When I'm high, everything becomes trippy and I am more out of it. It's harder for me to complete tasks (ex. using a microwave, cooking etc). It feels like my motor skills/speed has decreased, but I usually am able to catch/throw things as good as I can sober. Even though I am more out of it, I am told I become chill as fuck and I can keep my cool (even though it doesn't feel that way lmao). There is also a burnout period with weed, making you have an overwhelming need to sleep. Driving home is not impossible but HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. This is good for chill outs with your friends, solo-sessions, self reflection, listening to music and movie watching (no complex movies because I usually lose interest quick). Weed hangovers are a thing, but they don't physically hurt. My head is a bit light headed, and usually I get moderately depressed. Can last up to 2 days depending on how much you had.

When I'm drunk, my surroundings get desensitized to my brain, if that makes any sense. My motor skills/speed/spacial awareness feel the same, but in reality they're in the shitter. I become very flirty when drunk. I say the truth a lot (sometimes too much), and if I get too drunk I become very loud and make an ass out of myself. Alcohol (depending on the person) has a period cal the ""dizzies"" where you feel like [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/a/ae/Hyperspace_falcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20130312014242) is happening to you. Driving home is impossible when smashed, seriously get a cab. This is good for bars, social events, and meeting new people (all in moderate amounts, because drinking too much is not good in any situation). Alcohol hangovers are a thing obviously, causing heavy headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, lightheadedness and regret.

When mixing the two, both the desensitization and trippy combine, fucking me up. It's almost impossible for me to do anything (ex. last time I mixed I watched myself spill a whole box of cereal on the ground and was too fucked to clean it up). I'm still flirty, but not loud. Do not drive home when doing this, you will not have a good time. My body (specifically my face and fingertips) get really fuzzy, almost a pins and needles feeling, but it feels really good. I recommend more weed than alcohol when mixing, cause imo it feels better and it reduces hangover the next day. The hangover is a combination of the two others, so it's not pleasant. Mixing is good for house parties, clubs and concerts.

**td;lr - They're very different, combined they mix some qualities. Everyone is different, so this might not match exactly what you'd feel, but it'd be similar.**"

76	czj4oek	czj5jn0	Accounting	"Various things that you may or may not have appreciated in  relation to this:

-working capital represents only the operating assets and liabilities of a business, it should exclude anything that is debt or debt like to show only the working capitalism position that is due to operating (not investing or financing) decisions.

-working capital EXCLUDES cash, which may seem odd. One way to understand working capital is that it is the opposite of cash from operating activities. When your working capital decreases, your cash goes up, when your working capital increases, your cash goes down

-because of this relationship, working capital represents the amount of cash trapped in the business that cannot be used to pay dividends, pay debt or invest in assets.

-the problem with just looking at the cash balance is that it is harder to work out areas of improvement, harder to compare trends to previous periods and also harder to work out whether your cash is being impacted by cash from operations, or cash from financing or investing. (Unless of course you use a cashflow statement, which requires calculation of working capital anyway!)"	"Also, you are right that low working capital is better, but of course companies need some level of WC to operate. (Eg if you are a retailer you could reduce your WC by selling down all your stock, but what happens after that!)

Therefore what you are really concerned with is looking at trends in working capital and understanding whether there are ways to decrease working capital without affecting other things. If you decrease working capital by $5m, this is $5m of cash available immediately to the company, sometimes working capital management is the difference between success and bankruptcy.

-looking at days of sales or purchases in working capital balances helps understand the operating cycle of a business, again something you can't do with cash. Eg if a company has 10 days of sales in debtors, this means it takes 10 days to convert sales into cash. If creditors are payable in 5 days, this means you have to pay your expenses quicker than you collect cash. Overall this means you have 5 days of working capital that the company has to finance somehow. Looking at days sales or purchases rather than absolute values lets you compare trends even if the company has grown or declined significantly. Again, you can't see this looking at the cash balance."

There's better.

Sharena is a decent free utility off-tank buff-bot that also gives bonuses in arena a third of the time.

 It's easier to slide her into your lineup for a lot of people than it is to change your red for Alphonse.

DIG are well aware that no one wants to play against their massive zergs and they just don't care. DIG don't care for being good sports and they don't care about the server. They'll simply dismiss all criticism as ""elitist"". 

Flutty and some of the other ""top men"" seems to actively enjoy destroying the server. Look at them taunting everyone in /yell at every fight they're zerging. "	"I know they realise, but not enaugh to stop... I've seen this plenty of timeds. They come somewhere with the huge overpop and the whole facility pop just quit and move somewhere else. Even they can't enjoy that dammit.

Couple of guys from there already told me that they're always looking forward to ELME events cause they have someone to fight... If even they don't enjoy it, why on earth are they still doing that?"

98	dkzhvu8	dkzpdce	FindingFennsGold	"My point was that just because the search area has been narrowed by additional clues (I think that) most of us recognize the fact that the chances of finding the thing are still very very small. 

Many of us (including me) have come to realize after wasting some time and money, that we have to be MUCH more certain about a particular solve before we venture out again and spend time and money. We run our solves by others (family or friends), we try to eliminate ""confirmation bias"", we try to poke holes in our theories in every way possible. 

I've personally been back and forth between a place in Wyoming and another in New Mexico due to what I see are conflicts in two possible solutions. Both are pretty good, but I refuse to go until I feel that I can ""move with confidence"". If I still don't find it, then I'll chalk it up to another adventure and go back to the drawing board. 

On a personal note, I wasn't trying to disparage you - just wanted to say that it's not worth doing this if it's not fun. At least it wouldn't be for me."	"See, if I was one of those people who searched in Utah or Idaho, I would be pissed off....and that also goes for the Rio Grande Gorge and the hint that it is not under water as well.  Many people have spent millions of dollars looking in those states, areas, and places...and it's not fair to take them away after they have been searched by many.  Those two men who died in NM in my opinion died in vain, because he removed the area from the ""official map"" after the fact.  He should have just left everything as is and said, let the chips fall where they may.  I for one do not have anymore faith in Forrest Fenn because he removed the Gorge off of the official map.  If I were you, cjonesmo, I would save your money and forget about the treasure hunt, because at this point it's not about whether you have the correct solve or not, it's about whether Fenn is going to cut more areas away from his map.  I look at that map as a contract, not to be altered in anyway.....and Fenn to me is not abiding by the spirit of that contract with us searchers.  So in my opinion, I've been mislead up till now, and what changes may come to his map tomorrow, who knows?"
99	dkytc5z	dkzno9u	NASCAR	i think every track that has the option of a road course should look into it,if said track has two dates, yes i get that rovals arent road courses but that would make it i think more interesting for teams and fans ..but thats just my opinion	Well said.

"That was still a byproduct of the electoral college, the person who the supreme court ruled to take ALL of Florida's votes won.  It's a terrible system as you're essentially voting for people to vote on your behalf even if they don't elect the person you want them to elect.

Well both me and every lady I've ever asked takes only about ~30 seconds longer to poop. In my experience half hour shit are an exclusively guy thing. So unless you make noise nobody will know what's happening. But really it's more a culture of purposefully ignoring the bodily noises coming from the other stall.
114	dkz9bfv	dkzv4ur	AskReddit	I was house sitting in a huge house and set up a canary camera near my bedroom. I had an uneasy feeling someone else was in the house with me so I set up the camera just to make sure no one came near my room. In the middle of the night someone approached it from behind and turned it so it faced a blank wall. Then a few minutes later turned it back the way it was before. It tripped the canary and I got a notification on my phone. I saw it and searched the house thoroughly the next morning and never found anything. Needless to say, I slept with my door locked the rest of my time there. 	"Ugh this reminds me of the last and final time I house sat. I was watching my parents friends cat and since they had a pool and Wi-Fi (my parents didn't at the time) they let me stay at their house. It was very old, a very closed-off floor plan with tons of random doors and windows and a lot of hidden nooks. I never felt comfortable when I was there, but I just chalked it up to the house being old and creaky. 

One wednesday, after am unexpected half day, I get back to their house from work to feed the cat. Before doing anything else, I went to the bathroom. Even though I was there alone (or so I thought) I latched the hook lock. Im sitting there on the toilet and I watch the door get pushed gently to the extent that the hook would let it go, like someone was trying to very quietly see if they could get in. I told myself I was being stupid and that no one could be in there, I had locked all the doors every day. At the end of watching their house, I'm changing the bird feeder for the first time since I had been there and I noticed a door on the back porch that had been unlocked the whole time I was there. Every night I had slept there by myself, every time I heard noises and thought I was being stupid. The fucking house was wide open. "

I just wish Raw/SD did not feel like they were in such a holding pattern right now. We'll see I guess, the build to this PPV was terrible to me but it really delivered on ring work and I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would."	Kind of what happens while we are in the b shows. Had some title changes tonight so that is a bonus. But they build to mania. Then they build to summerslam and then on to mania. Everything else in between can be considered a holding pattern. 
117	cziybcv	czjakpu	DIY_eJuice	"Ok so when the flavor is at its ""sweet spot"" it actually will be stronger than if it was at a higher percentage?"	I had a strawberry cheesecake recipe that called for 20% ,total flavour. I cut down 8% down to 12% total and it tasted almost exactly the same but less chemically. Too much flavouring reduces overall perception of taste.

that might single-handedly sink her campaign.

Who, besides HRC, says, in more or less words, that not everyone should be allowed healthcare?

I mean...I just have a worthless psychology degree, but having 25+ million people without healthcare, and not wanting to change to a single-payer system whereby everyone would get healthcare, is just incredibly insulting to those who don't have healthcare.

Speaking of, I am one of those 25 million+. It's incredibly insulting....what she said. 

Seriously how could she be so...uncaring?

Which is why I'll die before I even think about voting for Hillary, even if she's the nominee. I'm in a 90% blue district so I'd stay home if she got the nom."

I see a lot of Sombra mains not using her on those maps either. what do you think?	Shes great as long as you arent getting witchhunted by anyone. The reason shes picked less is that its hard to get an advantageous health crate hacked without someone finding it. Also if you notice the enemy team hunting for your tp, call it out to your team and use the tp as a trap. I cant count the number of times ive killed winstons or tracers by ganking them while they wait on my tp

This seems to much of a coincidence to just be swept under the rug, so I am inclined to agree that hormones do affect political views. Is this really that groundbreaking however? everything from your mood to the growth of body hair to the amount of muscle on your body is based upon the hormones in your body right now, this is relatively small in comparison.

134		czj56uc	NASCAR		"RCR will come back strong. Dillon and Newman will be contenders.

Ganassi will come back even stronger. Both drivers make the Chase, and Larson gets multiple wins.

Roush does better, but they still aren't front runners consistently.

HScott gets some top 10's with Bowyer. Not much else other than that.

BK Racing is about as good as MWR was last year. Not good, but not horrible.

LFR gets some good finishes with Ty Dillon.

Front Row Motorsports possibly wins a race. A plate race, more than likely. Buescher and Cassill are very good plate racers."

What I meant was I wonder how many of the type of trolls referenced in this article are on this sub. There used to be a guy, GOPBlackGuy or something similar. He regularly posted how we should be good Christians, and bordered on how we should bow before whites. I feel like that guy was an infiltrator "	This sub and /r/blackladies are two of the most welcoming subs on the entire site.

139		dkzwgmm	CasualConversation		Was playing a bit of Destiny after some Doom, I have to say, going from 100+ FPS to 30 takes a lot of getting used to.  Started listening to a Fallout 4 video essay and now I'm listening to music (The Forest Seasons by Wintersun, which is less exciting than I think everyone was hoping), all while drinking a Mortal Kombat beer.

146	dkz5ykr	dkzu3xx	DarkAndLight	"I don't think Cohhcarnage needs to ""suck it up"", he's one of the biggest streamers on Twitch. Combat is a pretty fundamental thing for an RPG, something that certainly should have been working before opening the game up to EA."	"Theres a difference between ""working fine for our QA team of 30-100"" and ""working fine for 10 000 people crowding onto the servers at once"". That difference is EXACTLY what EA is for."
