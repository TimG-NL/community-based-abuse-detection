0		czjayls	Frugal		"please do supplement your food by taking advantage of community meals! generally food stamps cover fresh stuff (fruit, produce, meat/fish) and stuff that you need to expend effort to prepare (frozen fried chicken, yes; fried chicken from the deli counter that is cheaper, no)

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

edit: wanted to add that if you can arrange with someone to get mail at their place, do it. It's really hard to get a new job (or other benefits) with no address."

9	czj8br0	czj9vsu	Vive	I don't think Oculus will release the pricing for the Touch anytime soon. They learned their lesson about not releasing pricing early, as they got a ton of backlash for the $600 Rift. I also hear they're having a lot of problems getting the Touch technology to work because of connectivity issues and extremely low battery life which may pose an issue even a year from now and may affect the pricing, which is another reason they probably won't disclose the price ahead of time. But I am pretty sure it won't be less than $200 because it includes a whole other camera (which I hear they're also having issues with) and two controllers. I'd imagine it might even cost up to $300. Vive is seriously your best bet.	Don't get me wrong I want a Vive it just depends on how much it costs up front. I don't see the camera being that much on the touch, it's a camera ya know? They are pretty cheap these days. I hadn't heard about the tracking issues but if so that's a definite issue that would change my opinion. I'm just afraid Vive is going to come out over $1k and if that's the case I'll definitely go rift.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.  

It's also not saying good or bad.  It's just saying, I don't think 5% guaranteed annual rate of return."
36		dkzs1df	FORTnITE		I played on PC since the Alpha and it acts as my main account but I also have friends on xbox to play with so I purchased it again. Similar thing happened, I played for a few days and finally got an error message when logging in via Xbox and when I went back to PC it wouldn't let me in either. The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days. The whole making you go through the tutorial again I didn't have to deal with so that sounds scary.... I don't know if my fix will help with you... but if it does, yay?

38		dkztdu2	Entrepreneur		"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."

If you want a moment that I can remember, I have vague memories of a lot of Georgia moments. I kind of remember hearing about Georgia winning the SEC in 2005, I remember that Georgia played Hawaii in the 2007-08 Sugar Bowl and that I thought it was funny because Hawaii is the next state after Georgia alphabetically, and I remember seeing the end of the 2010 Georgia-Florida OT game and being disappointed that Florida won. I remember a little of the 2012 SEC Championship game and Georgia being ranked #3, but I didn't fully grasp how close we came to greatness until recently.

Being prepared to actually call it as he sees it and not buying into the rule of players toeing the line with the politically correct answer doesn't create an obligation to come up with a solution. 

Same way that you could ask players what they think would happen if some indigenous draftee does a war dance in their first game and dedicates it to his inspiration Goodes post game, 95% of players would tell you that there is nothing controversial about that yet you can be sure this would attract plenty of controversy regardless of whether or not it should. 

Edit: I'll go a step further and suggest the 95% are the problem. You can't fix a problem if your not prepared to admit it exist. It is the ones who openly say there is an issue who open the door to discussing how to fix it... and the persin with the solution is not necessarily the person calling out the problem. "	"See I understand your point, I just really doubt the motivation. This is not some murky little understood phenomenon. You don't need to be playing at a footy club to realise homophobia still exists. 

Literally nobody is pretending homophobia is extinct. They may insinuate we should be better than that, but that is not the same thing. The fact footy is traditionally a boys' club and not easily overturned, is something well understood, hence the league's focus on women's involvement, broader community involvement, and the general talk of homosexuality etc.

So if everyone understands the problem, and he isn't offering a solution, then that raises the obvious question; why speak on this in the first place? Well we all know he loves the sound of his own voice, so that's a good starting point in answering that question."

If people want more lanes open, they need to buy more to justify it. As it stands, ""the system"" generates schedules that are tinkered with as little as possible (usually to meet availability demands or to be below scheduled hours limitations set above store level); these schedules are meant to reflect customer flow as best as possible.

And ideally, if you see more than two people in line, they're supposed to be getting salesfloor people to the front to help, though that doesn't always work promptly.

84	czj476p	czj4qeo	Pathfinder_RPG	I believe what your friend wants is a [Fortuitous](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/fortuitous) Weapon and the [Pushing Assualt](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pushing-assault-combat) Feat.  This will actually let him exhaust enemy movement using his Combat Patrol.	"Alternatively invest in the trip feats and just trip your opponent as your AOO. They then have to spend a move action to get back up, (provoking another AOO) and it depletes their actions.

Edit: Don't know why I didn't think of it initially, but with Fortuitous, make your first AOO the trip, then your second is only at a -1 penalty if your opponent is prone... Nasty."

Honestly the greatest corporate incentive ever because everyone uses the products and shit, I get half off, I can buy twice as much!

89	dgyzkjw	dgz1gk1	TumblrInAction	Ok, point to the *literal* verse that tells me to go and kill people in the bible. Because the last time I read the ten commandments, it said to specifically not do that.	"Deuteronomy 17:12
Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the LORD your God is to be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel."
90	czj7sy0	czj7zx8	MakingaMurderer	Yeah, it is difficult. I was hoping someone with access to more information would chime in. Like you said, the sites listed are the ones you have to pay for access to get more information. Some people already have access and can get full background checks.	"Well I certainly appreciate having something new put on here anyway thank you, although I did notice to tie in with another theory ""The German""

The German heritage can be found in the Kusche &amp; Bruns family history tree's.

We don't seem to know when to not engage. We do have users that shit talk on other subs. There's at least 2-3 users that create alt accounts to mess with other subs all the time. 

Also, as the saying goes, ""if everywhere to go you meet assholes, then perhaps you're the asshole."""	"Hmmm, well those peeps need to grow up.

This was followed by thirty five daily radiation treatments with seven simultaneous weekly chemotherapy treatments that ended just before Christmas.

Cancer was stage four. Five year survival is around 60%. It

After a couple of PET scans,  no sign of it returning.

Went from 240 to 170 pounds.

Still have trouble eating.

Gotta be honest here- it sucks!

Worst was right after treatments finished.  I just got sicker and sicker.

Did not need to get a feeding tube.

People tell me I got off easy.  Glad I didn't have a worse time of it.

I'm 63.  Diagnosed a year ago on August 17th.

Not back to my new normal yet. Having gum problems, and post radiation dentistry is said to be very problematic.

The worst thing has been the constipation, so make sure he takes a dose of Miralax every day.

Whoopee.

Good luck.

All the words that end in gh for example, -gh used to have it's own unique sound, at some point English lost that sound but the town names stayed the same.
