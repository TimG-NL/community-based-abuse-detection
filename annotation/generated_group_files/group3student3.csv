Natural born citizens also have some crazy ideas on occasion but just because someone wants to kill a black man for marrying a white woman, doesn't mean the law is going to change to allow that. But I don't know just believe what you want and keep voting in line with it. I'm tired.	"This is a Democracy, it only takes %3 to sway an election, we are at %1 now.

But it is far more than that.  Look what happened in Turkey.  Islamists used to be %10 of the population 70 years ago (about the same as France today), now Ergodan, who was voted in Democratically, is firing and imprisoning secular judges and military officials and changing the constitution to make Turkey an Islamic nation.

The Muslim brotherhood itself has a very clear agenda to implement the same thing in the west, and many Imams talk openly about it,including ""outbreeding the infidels"".  

The same thing that happened in Turkey will happen in Europe, and then the gays will be executed legally, as is currently done in the Middle East.."

I agree with everything you said. Imo the ADO events cater towards the recreational dart player and it just so happens some of them are REALLY good at playing darts for American players. 

There might be a few examples that count as ""professional"" but it's fairly rare. I won't name any names but there was a VERY well known US player that won 3 Dartslive events several years ago to the tune of 12 grand each. Plus he had a contract with a Japanese company that was quite lucrative. But that's just a one off example. "	"I started the thread as it was my first tournament setting of any kind. I don't disagree with you at all. We had the same discussion while we were there. It was cool to see the US World Cup Duo (Butler and Young) play since I just watched them a few months ago.

44	czjf6t5	czjf9u6	DestinyTheGame	"My wish list for the Crucible:

• Double the spawn time of special and heavy. 
• Add just a little more flinch to snipers.
• Reduce aim assist on all snipers.
• Bring Thorn's damage in-line with legendary weapons. The DoT should be what makes it exotic, but it shouldn't do so much extra damage. 
• Bring TLW's damage more in-line with legendary weapons. This thing is way too strong. 4 body shots for a kill, and 2 to the head (hipfire). This thing shoots faster than MIDA and doesn't even require headshots for a fast time to kill. Reduce the extra damage. 
• Since TLW gets bonus damage while hipfiring, shouldn't First Curse at least get some sort of bonus damage while First Curse perk is active? Why can TLW kill someone with max armor in 2 shots, but First Curse can't? (Assuming TLW doesn't get nerfed.)
• High impact auto rifles need crit damage increased. Higher impact autos should have the farthest range as well. 
• Focus Fire perk on high impact autos should make crits at a minimum of 39, and not the current (33).
• High impact pulse rifles should be restored to their former damage. 
• Fusion rifles should be effective outside of shotgun range. I'd say about double the range is good. Tightening stability goes hand to hand with effective range. 

I know it's a pretty ridiculous list, but I think I'd actually be able to enjoy the Crucible if these changes were implemented. We *need* variety. I'm just tired of being killed by the same six weapons every game. TLW, Thorn, MIDA, 1000-Yard, Party Crasher, and Harrowed Quillim's Terminus.

Edit: Of course I get downvoted because nobody agrees with a TLW rebalance. I've been on the receiving end of that weapon for a year now and I can say that I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was already perfectly balanced. "	"I think these are all good except the TLW nerf. It's a shell of its former self, and it just straight up dies outside of, like, twenty feet. I never feel like I've been unfairly killed by it any more. If I get melted, I had it coming.

If it gets nerfed again, it becomes unusable, and I don't think that's necessary."

I could launch into a nice long paragraph describing the history of Public Housing policy in the United States, how urban tenements first gave rise to building codes, and the first public housing projects. How these projects failed when they became to grand in size and scope, which lead to alternative policies such as use of section 8 tax credits to try and increase the supply of affordable housing, which eventually culminated in Mortgage Backed Securities being pitched as a tool that would allow lenders to serve clients they otherwise wouldn't touch, because other banks were willing to absorb that risk, and thus these lenders wouldn't be as leveraged and could afford to write more loans, and give those loans to middle class people who otherwise could never afford a proper down payment.

The thing is, I find these super polarized people like you on reddit to be laughable. You are no different than these Trumpettes screeching that Orange Mussolini can do no wrong. Basically, you believe the world is completely black and white, and that all banks are evil, and everything is the fault of corporate greed. It is a fucking joke. Reality isn't a movie. The truth is most people in that industry are good, morally sound, hard working people. Sure, there are individual instances of greed and douchiness, which you could find in every industry. If you want to actually have a serious conversation about the multitude of systemic structural flaws that led to the Sub Prime Mortgage crisis that is a conversation that can be had, but having it with the Occupy Wall Street hippie crowd that not only doesn't even understand what the banking industry as a whole does, but just wants to point fingers and screech platitudes, well that isn't going to be very productive.

The Dune Series. The original series by Frank Herbert and then some of Brian Herbert's works. It's a sci-fi novel (Actually, it's more of a sci-philosopy, sobrang daming philosophical musings nung book, nagkataon lang na sci-fi ung backdrop)

112	dgygtr6	dgyt87e	OverwatchCirclejerk	[verwijderd]	"A guardian angel to those who come under her care, Dr. Angela Ziegler is a peerless healer, a brilliant scientist, and a staunch advocate for peace.
After obtaining her MD and PHD in Switzerland, Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.

Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.

During her Overwatch years, she once dressed as a witch for Halloween.

Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. One example was the development of the biotic rifle by Torbjörn. Torbjörn provided assurances that the device was only intended for healing, but Ziegler maintained that this was setting Overwatch down a road that could lead to the weaponization of biotic technology, and that she had only conducted research in the field on the condition that it would not be used for offensive purposes.

Seven years before the present day, Ziegler was involved in an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander Jack Morrison to end the King's Row Uprising in London, England. Earlier the same day, Ziegler argued with Morrison over Overwatch's inability to intervene in the conflict due to the English prime minister expressively forbidding of any Overwatch action within the United Kingdom. Dr. Ziegler expressed her concern for the thousands in the city who needed medical aid, and lamented how Overwatch was made to help people, not sit on the sidelines. After Jack authorized the mission, while preparing to board an aircraft, Ziegler welcomed Cadet Lena Oxton to the team. She commented on how her inspirational words convinced Jack to authorize the mission, and how he was very invested in her career, and had asked Ziegler to keep an eye on her. Zigler then told Oxton how she could call on her if she ever needed any help.

In Overwatch's final days, the group was faced with a series of allegations, and Ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the United Nations. In light of the fight between Overwatch members Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, Ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable. They had drifted further and further apart ever since Morrison had been chosen over Reyes for the position of strike commander, and that rift had widened despite her efforts.

Mercy helps the innocent
When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by war. Though she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled, hoping to make a more peaceful world.

When Winston issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Mercy was in the Middle East. Mercy was unsure if Overwatch should be restored.

Hope that helps.

119		czj5z1f	HaircareScience		Don't desparage. It took me years to get my rotine down, but it is possible to resolve an itchy scalp. When my scalp gets flanky/itchy....I will actually lose sleep and when I did sleep, I'd scratch my scalp till I'd find blood under my fingernails. I've gone to dermatologists, removed sulfate shampoos, tried natural ingredients  (tea tree, neem oil, etc), tried salicylic acid shampoos, coal tar shampoos, the zinc compund head and shoulders uses, selenium sulfide shampoos....the whole friggin gambit. Here's what works for me: first thing, i never wash my hair the same way twice. Mixing it up somehow helps. My shower looks like a crazy person's because I use so many different products in rotation. Then I do a multi-step process that seems to work. First I use a generic shampoo in a quick and dirty way that kind of breaks up the oil in my hair. Then I use a salicylic acid shampoo (dermarest, specifically.) The chemical exfoliation helps the next step work better. Then I rotate between a 4% rx ketakonazole shampoo, coal tar shampoo and head and shoulders. Hope this helps.

He was speeding on the 101 freeway at like 2 in the morning after dropping off his then-girlfriend (later my grandmother) at the airport.  There was literally no one else on the freeway.  He was pulled over by highway patrol.  Here's how my grandpa and Uncle Sliver say the conversation went:

Grandpa: Is there a problem officer?

Sliver: How fast were you going just then?  Buck, buck twenty?

Grandpa: Sounds about right.

Sliver: That's a nice car.

Grandpa: Thank you.

Sliver: 1929 Roadster?  

Grandpa: Yup.

Sliver: Wanna race?

Grandpa: What?

Sliver: Come on, let's race.

They then raced along the 101 for another hour, ending up in my hometown where they went for drinks.  Sliver was best man at my grandpa's wedding a few years later and they've been buddies ever since.  "	Your grandpa and his friend sound awesome. I'd love to hear the other stories he's got.
