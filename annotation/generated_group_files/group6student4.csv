"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."
22		czj9shy	WeAreTheMusicMakers		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "

58	dgy4lgf	dgyzwvt	AskReddit	"Zig-zag trenches being dug toward the perimeter of Khe Sanh.

I had heard about them, but then I'd heard about a lot of strange things in my first couple of months in-country in Vietnam, 1968. Didn't really register.

One of the weird things about Vietnam was that there was no front line. The enemy, the Viet Cong guerrillas (VC) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) were the topic of conversation, but you never saw them - no dead soldiers, no POWs, no flag on a distant hill that marked their positions. 

That war was the first full-scale war that involved the hide-and-seek kind of warfare we're more used to now. Now the idea of two armies banging it out across a ""front"" seems as strange as the peekaboo! kind of war did to the Korean and WWII cadre that led us in Vietnam.

It stayed weird, even after I got outside the wire a couple of times. I was mostly firing at bushes and trees. We all were. Sometimes the bushes and trees fired back, and sometimes when we went to investigate there'd be someone dead or hurt behind the bushes.

I was wondering if Americans, South Vietnamese soldiers (ARVNs), the VC and the NVA were ALL fighting some kind of plants, triffid warfare. I thought maybe the bushes were shooting both ways, and laughing at us all.

Seemed that way. The enemy was abstract, almost surreal to us. No one knew exactly where he was. 

I was designated as an artillery air observer - I sat in the backseat of a piper-cub-like airplane, or the right seat of an observation helicopter and adjusted artillery from the air on the top of suspected targets that I couldn't see because of all that damned vegetation. Occasionally we got shot at. The rounds came up at us out of more bushes. Never saw any humans.

The Demilitarized Zone north of Hue was lined with Marine ""dye marker"" forts, the biggest of which was jammed 50 miles west of the sea at the juncture of North and South Vietnam with Laos. It was called Khe Sanh, and it was a *huge* Marine base.

Khe Sanh was the low-hanging fruit the US military had deliberately set up to attract major formations of NVA. 

The Viet Minh, the original opponents of the French in Vietnam, had reclaimed half their country from the French at another such base, *Điện Biên Phủ*, in 1954. They had laid siege to the isolated base, dug zigzag trenches toward the perimeter, to allow their infantry to approach the wire safely for a final assault.

I had read about those zigzag trenches. The general leading the NVA assault on Khe Sanh was the same general who won that old battle. I reckon the US command just decided to package up a firebase out in the boonies to look just like *Điện Biên Phủ*, let Giap imagine a replay of his glory days.

Well, he fell for it hook line and sinker, so much so that the Americans were kind of surprised, a little worried. I finally got assigned a flight out to Khe Sanh.

My God. There was this huge base, bunkered in and defended like nothing else I saw in Vietnam. We couldn't have taken that base, if the Marines didn't want to let us in. 

And around it was what used to be jungle but now was a moonscape of bomb and artillery craters. And through the moonscape, I could see them - zigzag trenches heading for the wire. They never made it - always ended in twenty or thirty huge bomb craters.

But that was my first *real* evidence that yes, there were actual human beings out there trying to kill us. And getting killed, too. Lots of them. Someone, many someones dug those trenches - bushes didn't do that. And you could see where they died, blown to smithereens.

I guess that was the idea. It certainly worked. Giap spent a generation of NVA soldiers trying to take that camp. It made ALL the papers in the US. Some mighty scary headlines, but really the issue was never in doubt. All they managed to do was get a couple of battalions up to the wire, where they were mowed down and blown up. They needed divisions of men hitting that wire, and that was *never* gonna happen.

This is a long story about how I finally awoke to the idea that yes, I was actually fighting someone, someone human that is. I mean, I *knew* that before I came in country, but y'know I don't think I believed it.

But those trenches... were monuments to the valor of the men opposing us. Gotta give them that. That was suicidal, crazy.

Besides, their sacrifice was not in vain. Win the battle, lose the war. The Khe Sanh siege, especially the resemblance to *Điện Biên Phủ*, was a major factor in the creation and motivation of the anti-war movement stateside, which eventually took America out of the war. I guess I wasn't the only one who was impressed by those trenches."	"Your story reminds me of a book a read not too long ago called ""West Dickens Avenue"" it is about a Marine who spent 77 days at Khe Sanh.  The author was a part of a mortar team, and he might have been in contact with you.

I also find it interesting how the man who wrote ""West Dickens Avenue"" and yourself have taken vastly different views of the war in general.  John Corbett wrote as if going out to Vietnam, seeing combat, going on patrols, and seeing the things he did was all just par for the course.  Even after seeing the enemy, he always seemed rather detached from it all.

All in all, it was an interesting read, and I recommend anyone who is curious about Khe Sanh to pick it up. "

To elaborate: Sher Khan is losing pilots and cargo in the Bermuda Trapezoid. He tricks Baloo into flying for him by giving him a trophy and declaring him the greatest pilot in the city. There's a comedic portion where Baloo argues with Bossy Cat Lady (whatever her name is) claiming that he won't lose the plane since he's the greatest pilot in the city. The planes and ships were going missing due to Don Karnage putting a giant mirror that tricks pilots into thinking that they're upside down and cause them to crash. Kit and Baloo crash the Sea Duck, fight the pirates, and save the day. Baloo realizes he's been tricked and barges into Khans headquarters, demanding a trophy for Kit as a token of appreciation.

74	dkzs84s	dkzt7oo	Guildwars2	Is exotic berserker armor still the standard end game armor? I hear ascended isn't really necessary.	So long as we're talking PvE? Sort of. Berserker is used for Power builds, Viper for Condi builds. Condi builds got buffed recently so Viper is pretty viable now albeit a lot more expensive than Zerker's. A few other gear types get situational use, like Minstrel for raid Chronomancers. Ascended is a modest stat increase from Exotic, but is still BiS, and is fundamentally required for high-difficulty Fractals, so a lot of people work towards it.

118	czjeqmt	czjeye0	DestinyTheGame	I feel like like I very often outgun rushing shotgunners with my doctrine of passing. I also feel like I have an edge against midrange snipers as well. Although the doctrine is considered an upper echelon primary. I think the main issue is that there isn't much variety in what primaries are effective not that there are no effective primaries. 	"Here's the thing: even if Doctrine, MIDA, and TLW are sort-of-kind-of-okay right now, that still leaves us with:

A) only three competitive options, when the lack of diversity was one of the biggest issues/complaints of year 1 (Thorn/TLW/Hawkmoon/Messenger)

and

B) three options that are *way worse* than the best three options in Y1. 

Doctrine of Passing is nowhere near as good as a Year 1 Thorn. A guy with a Y2 TLW would lose to a guy with a Y1 TLW 100 out of 100 times. It's not even close.

On the other hand, snipers, heavy, and supers (for the most part) haven't changed since year 1, and shotguns are still dominant despite nerfs, so where we've ended up is still only having three competitive primary weapons, except now they're much weaker than before, but everything else maintained it's power. That's pretty broken, IMO."

"I think right now it's to easy to slap made in the US on the package and call it a deal with no accountability. They can't falsely advertise but they can manufacture a product in a low wage country, finish it in the US and then declare it made in the US. 

Making the address of the factory readily available on the package would let us as the consumers know who is honest and who is not. Once you know the address it would only take a few minutes to figure out how much manufacturing is actually done there and the big one, weather or not they are abusing a visa program.

130		czjd235	PoliticalDiscussion		"I will attempt to respond to your generalizations with some of my own.

Senator Sanders is promoting many ideas that are seen as hallmarks of the ""college liberal"". Things like universal healthcare, free or reduced tuition, socialism as a viable economic model, etc. The ""college liberal"" does not often find a candidate who shares these ideas with them.

Adults (I'll assume over 40 here) likely have carryovers from the Cold War and what socialism was seen as then. My parents for example, equate socialism with the USSR. While this isn't technically correct, they were both born in the 60s and were brought up being told that the USSR, and therefore communism/socialism, was their enemy. 

They have also seen firsthand the fall of communism/socialism in Eastern Europe and view an attempted return to that as horrible.

Now, again, these are very broad generalizations and I'm basing my thesis for the perceived adult dislike of Sanders on a single issue: socialism.

Many adults like Bernie. Many young people don't like Bernie and his policies. I am one of them. 

Neither young people or adults are monolithic entities. Both can have all sorts of different viewpoints.

Edit: also, some adults may have seen candidates like Bernie come up in the past promoted ideas like his that they approve of, only to watch them fail. They may be disillusioned. "

All these other guys are on nonsense using c4's and what not, I mean you could do that also but it'll take longer"	Yeah this is what I do. Set up with an MSR (no supressor) up the road and wait for a clean shot. Shoot the resource truck twice and the whole convoy stops. If you're super pro, you can pop the driver and the truck will stop with a ton of health left. It helps to be about 300m away before engaging to not get immediately steamrolled by the escorts. Then drone over to the stopped convoy, mark everyone, then put the suppressor back on and pick off the remnants. When they're all gone, saunter up and tag the truck.
