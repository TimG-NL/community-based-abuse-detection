4		dkzssqo	FireEmblemHeroes		"I had to look it up on the wiki but it's only been 3 months since Xander came out... on a different gacha game I played, it took a year and a half for them to rerun the Boss unit battle I needed. And I waited and waited. As such, I'm sorry, I can't have too much sympathy for people regarding this. Because I know IS is a lot more generous and care more for their game than the other gacha I play, there is no way they would not do a rerun in the next couple of months. I'm just glad they've delayed it as I would prefer not to face more filth emblems in my attempts to get to tier 20. Lord have mercy.

They're most likely to rerun Xander/Camus sometime in August as part of the special events. I will simply be amused when people's complaints of not having Xander/Camus transitions into pure hatred for horse emblem and cries for nerfs... *cackles* Join us."

By saying you think the people saying you're lucky are being inappropriate, you're showing just as much disregard for the situation they may be in. To them, you may indeed be lucky.

When it comes down to it, you ARE lucky you have a supportive family and SO. That doesn't change that you are incredibly unlucky in many other areas. If people say such things to you, try to focus on the good behind it, which is acknowledging the good things in your life and the people who care for you.

Our customers fuel the principal and we let them take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in what looks like a money transfer/FX service. We don't front run our customers orders, and disclose our fees/FX markups (currently we do not take a piece of the FX, which is why people are getting money printing level deals with us).	phenomenal! operating with high quality business practices will hopefully reward you in the long run. good luck!

27		czjdjdi	LucidDreaming		"I remember when I was trying to learn japanese that in one of my dreams I met a group of people that were speaking japanese to me and I was speaking back as if I knew what I was talking about.  And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language.  But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say.  

I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn.  Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness.  I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about.  Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style.  

But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream.  

I've never met someone that could.  And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to.  It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about.  I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt.  I mean yeah they'll believe you, but they aren't the ones dreaming it."

33		czjfsbl	AsianParentStories		"I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. 4 years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying 4 yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want.

 Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. 

It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this. "

47		czja1wt	Fantasy		"I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes:
 I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well.  It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. 
I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes.
And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than 4 star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. 

Current top series:

* **Way of Kings/Words of Radiance**: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)
* **Song of Ice and Fire:** Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change. 
* **LOTR** Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling,  it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is *fantasy* with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.
* **Riyria Revelations**: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.
* **Dresden Files** I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role. 
* **Hard Magic Series**: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.
* **Ready Player One**:Just a fun read. The 80's were fun.
* **Enders Game**: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.
* **Wheel of Time series**: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.
* **Hitchhikers Guide series**: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.
* **Asimov's Foundation Series** More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.
* **Dragon Riders of Pern**:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?
* **Harry Potter**: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.
* **Artemis Fowl series**: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. 

Books I like:

* **Mistborn**: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.
* **Same for everything else written by Butcher**: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.
* **Legend of Drizzt**: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **Iron Druid series** I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **The Shadow of What was Lost** : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book.

Do not like: 

* **Name of the Wind** As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.
* **Monster hunter international** Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.
* Tried **The Malazan Book of the Fallen**: just couldn't get into the story.
* And all my friends keep begging me to give the **Dark Tower Series** another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense"	"**Gay panic defense**

The gay panic defense is a legal defense, usually against charges of assault or murder. A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent temporary insanity because of a purported psychiatric condition called homosexual panic. The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.

Trans panic is a similar defense applied towards cases where the victim is a transgender or intersex person.

101	czj3wnj	czj4ho2	AskReddit	"The close adherence to the Quran means that mainstream Muslims are not comparable to mainstream Christians in terms of the strictness of their beliefs.

It's not all of why they believe that way, but it's a large enough component to make a difference. When the book is unquestionable, the laws generated from interpreting the book tend also to be.

Neither Christians nor Muslims remove all the bad parts of their religious doctrines. Muslims tend to remove a lot less, because they started 700 years later, and (if Sunni) can't touch anything closely related to the Quran."	"No, you seriously aren't understanding what mainstream Muslims believe and I don't blame you, many people on the Internet share this naive and sophomoric view of Islamic doctrine. Most Muslims do not get their religious knowledge from the Quran, in terms of what Muslims practice, the Quran has little to do with it. The fact is that most Muslims do not read the translation of the Quran and even if they did, it's not easily understood without some hadith to support it and give it context like what conditions it must be followed in etc. This is why most Muslims rely on hadith and teachings that are passed down, hadith is much simpler to understand and that's what most Muslims follow. Most Muslims agree that the Quran itself is not enough to understand and practice Islam and even the hadith can be slightly problematic in terms of reliability and contradictions. This is why they rely on fiqh, the four schools of thought hanafi, hanbali, maliki and shafi have simplified the teachings into reliability and made rulings on what's permissable or not permissable. All sunni Muslims follow one of the four schools of thought, except the people who identify as just sunni as sunni means a follower of the sunnah and sunnah is the way of Muhammad. There are slight disagreements between the four fiqhs but generally they're close and they aren't really regarded as wrong by other schools of thought. The problem with contemporary issues is that scholars and imams make rulings based on implications e.g TV being wrong, cartoons, etc. This is one of the reasons why some Muslims say certain things are prohibited whilst doing other things. Again, what Muslims do and do not follow is heavily based on culture. A hanafi Muslim in UK who follows his religion is very different from a hanafi Muslim in Pakistan. They both follow the same school of thought but it's society and culture which influences the lifestyle. There's also not a lot to ""remove"" half the things in the Quran that seem violent go along with the context of hadith, some other things have been examined by the fiqh and contemporary scholars and by cross referencing hadith, the verses have been redefined. E.g there's an importance of God's law which must be followed, then there's hadith saying sharia law for you living in a non Muslim country is to follow the laws of the land. "

107	czj0vi3	czj8fk1	MakingaMurderer	Scott was never fingerprinted nor was a DNA profile ever developed for him. However, everyone else involved with the case and that lived on the Avery property was fully fingerprinted and had their DNA profiles collected. This is a fact. And I am most certain Kathleen Zellner is going to have this explored, and have Scott Tadych's fingerprints matched against the lone unidentified fingerprint that was found on the RAV4. I think the clock is ticking against Tadych.	Yes, and on the recent Dateline special, Zellner said there is a new forensic technology that she believes could produce new compelling evidence to reopen the case. TBD...
