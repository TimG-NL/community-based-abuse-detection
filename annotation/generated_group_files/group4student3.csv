The past 30 days has seen the Euro (Finlands currency) weaken from about 1.13201EUR:1USD to it's current 1.18433EUR:1USD This is not quite 5%, but still fairly significant.

Currently NOK is at 5.38 Euro, which would be 6.39 USD. On US exchange, $NOK ADR is $5.36. This is within 1% of the exchange rate. 

If you overlay the NYSE and the HEL charts, around june 30th the NYSE ADR appears to be doing better. That is because from the period of June 26th to the 30th, the Euro weakened considerably vs the USD ~1.8%

In addition to currency exchange rates, the discrepancies in the highs and lows can be explained by the timing of news releases. Generally the Helsinki exchange and the NYSE track each other within a few percent, but Nokia releases many PR and their earnings reports after market close in Helsinki, which is premarket in the US. United states then gets the pops which level off by the time Helsinki market opens.

There is also most likely a difference in perception of the company between European and American investors to take in to account.

tl;dr

Yes, mostly currency, ""Idiot."" If you can't be arsed to do the math and research yourself, don't get childish and shitty with those who are trying to point you in the right direction."	You're wrong. It is down 8.5% from its peak in Helsinki compared to 2.3% in the NYSE.

Seoul responded to Trump's comments by saying that under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it. Do you have any evidence that that statement is false? You say the THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA. THAAD is no exception. 	"Did you even read what I wrote? Or are you just trying to strawman me? 

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it. 

&gt;THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

Example: if a car dealer sells a car he must include a warranty under law, so that sale is covered by law, but then if the dealer says no actually you have to pay an extra $x or i'm not delivering that car he can do that and is not violating any law."

I disagree. Knowing that the studios are driven to seek the highest return for their film means they'll constantly be searching for corners to cut. VFX has been one of those corners for a long time, and the fact that there hasn't been union representation has helped that. Establishing union agreements for the industry will change that.  
 
When that happens, they'll continue to try to make their product for the cheapest possible and sell it for as much as possible, as many times as possible. It just won't be on the backs of the VFX artists and studios any longer."	"I honestly don't think we have the same understanding of supply side economics. You essentially agree with me that the studios will seek to make their movies and games as cheaply as possible but you don't see that as a barrier to unionization or the studios seeking cheaper ""scab"" vendors as a potential result.

This seems like the most important point. Games just rarely go that late anymore (assuming average to high MMR games).

That said, it doesn't impact me too much, unlike the removal of FotM—with right masteries, you used to be able to get 40+ regen by stacking health regen tank items (FotM + SV + Guardian's Hammer), all for just 6k in gold, and can conditionally bypass Warmog's in favor of other items that are more useful in team fighting.

I am _really_ curious how the midseason update next week is going to affect the tank and bruiser builds, though, especially with the addition of those two superb tank items (Adaptive Helm for anti-skill and DoT spamming mages, and Gargoyle for multi-man resistance gains). For one, I expect the likes of Cass and Teemo to see some drop in win rate over the next few weeks."	"I think a big reason for me is on most AD tanks/bruisers i can usually utilize regen. If there's a few enemy AP's i can build visage and titan hydra. Lots of ap add banshee's. 

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of? 

Idk you could come up with something fun and balance-able."

89		dkzr1qe	Gunpla		"I hand painted with Vallejo for quite a while but now I'm switching to Tamiya. Vallejo is very forgiving in terms of brush strokes, but they're bad at sticking to the plastic (the primers are better, but still not great). Tamiya is harder to get an even finish with (retarder is supposed to help), but dries quickly and bonds well. With gunpla you're assembling painted pieces and posing, so being able to stand up to scuffs can make a difference. That said, the suggestion to use lacquer thinner is a good one if you don't mind the fumes. Vallejo does have a great color selection, plus lots of primers, varnishes, mediums, washes, etc. Whatever you choose I do recommend using a real thinner; water/alcohol aren't quite as nice.

I'd say get some cheap brushes that aren't bottom of the line, different sizes. Always use the largest brush you can for a piece, to minimize brush strokes. Invest in nice fine tip brushes for smaller details -- I like the gsi creos ones, you can get them thru Amazon. Strong, even bristles and predictable behavior will save you headaches when trying to paint the little stuff.

I use the alligator clips on sticks. I hold them by the clip while painting (sometimes challenging to find a place to clip it on) and put them back on the stick to cure.

Be prepared for a lackluster first kit. It takes practice, but if you pay attention to how the tools and materials behave, you'll get better."

No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful. I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit? Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it. 

So yes, you're a troll. "	"&gt; No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful.

My viewpoints aren't even remotely offensive. If you've got a very thin skin, then yeah maybe my comments are rude and unwanted, but they certainly are very helpful comments.

&gt; I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit?

The views that I have aren't horribly offensive at all. Regarding women, I never said that they were ""worthless piles of shit."" It's just that Western societies like ours are under siege by feminists who say they want ""equal"" rights for women when they actually want female domination. Women are mentally and physically different from men and thus should not have the same rights that men have.

&gt; Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it.

Despite the number of downvotes that I get from cowardly, close-minded people like yourself, there are still a lot of people who agree with the things that I say. I believe everything that I write, and I'm sure that there are people out there who appreciate what I have to say.

&gt; So yes, you're a troll.

No, I'm not."

114		czjaotg	Cooking		The trick is to change you, not the beans.  Eat beans every day, pretty much, until your gut develops the most efficient bugs for digesting them without excessive gas.  It is a microbiome thing more than a cooking method.  Those bugs do not stick around indefinitely though.  We go vegetarian for Lent many years, which means a lot of beans.  If you do not move into that slowly and deliberately, the penance for the first week or so is more olfactory than dietary.

The leds are 15W each, so i thought since they aren't as powerful as they needed to be (i think), i would take the babies closer to the light for the beginning period. I'm actually running 18/6, even since they are autos it shouldn't matter much. Also they are starting to spit out their first 5 blades leaves!

Back onto the problem, i plan on moving onto a MarsHydro II 400w, is it overkill for such a space (since height is really limited) or will it be fine?
Also, may it be that she is too close to the lights, so no need to be stretching?

""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?""

Sidenote - this Subreddit is about the programme ""Making a Murderer"" - not purely a place to toss Avery off. So to downvote anyone suggesting anything that doesn't make Avery a saint is to go against the very ethos of the show. You are in effect being the same as the State in the case - they were seeing only how he can be guilty - whereas you are seeing him only as being innocent.

The show never suggests who it thinks the murderer is, it only shows that he wasn't given a fair trial. So get a grip."
