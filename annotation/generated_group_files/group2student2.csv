1	dkztc5x	dkztrvd	AskReddit	"I guess I'm a little different there but I totally understand it. I can definitely spend longer periods by myself, but if I'm in the house for more than a couple days I get really antsy and then need to go outside. If there is any sort of big outdoor project I've got going on, I can definitely stay on my property alone as long as I can be active outside.

"	I'll go outside in the backyard often, unless it's winter, and just hang out with my dogs. And I enjoy going out and doing things, going to the library, the coffee shop near my house, the farmers market, or even the mall, but I can be perfectly content just being at the house.  Dealing with people can be exhausting, especially when it's ride or stupid people haha. 
2	dgz1102	dgz2dso	EliteDangerous	Small ships only sounds shit. And the amount of time in between each date is huge. 2 days to travel 500 light years? That's doable in 15 minutes. 	"The goal behind having small ships only is twofold: 1 is a very affordable expedition so many new players can easily join in, and 2 is to provide an interesting alternative to the traditional ""aspaconda"" expeditions. It gives a challenge to people to try and engineer their ass off with the small ships. It was a huge success last year (we had over 300 people register when we were expecting 50), and was a real blast. Sometimes quite literally."

I said you were not answering my question about the game being broken 4 months after release because you're one of SDS's favorite streamers. Your messages proved that. All the other messages are just your word against mine, what you saw versus what I saw. I don't give a shit if you're here now or not.

5	dkzpr1z	dkzsdzm	Android	You might want to give a bit more info than that? What specifically didn't you like about the OP5 reviews?	"The complaints that turned me off the most were with OnePlus not the phone itself. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with. In addition, the customer support is shotty, but that can be anecdotal although it still does worry me. The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much. 

All in all, I am just trying to shop around for comparable phones and was wondering if there was something similar or more powerful than the OP5 whether the price is higher or not."

Like, last year, you just printed off a coupon and only once they were all used (or mostly used, I suspect) was the coupon pulled. Now they put up X (1,000 in this instance, apparently) coupons via the Learning Network, and once those are ""claimed"" the offer is gone. And yet, 800 of those people may never use the coupon. 

Last years Samsung Accom lasted for like *four or five months*. This one lasted for like four or five *hours* (well... ten hours, but still). \*facepalm\*"	Yes it is bs because with only 1,000 coupons and 1,026 stores there are entire stores that didn't get even one. I thought that the point of the accommodations program was to allow employees to have better knowledge of and experience with the products that they sell. So how are we going to get that real world knowledge when only 0.8% of all the employees nationwide have a shot at a coupon?
38	czba7se	czj6ui0	MakingaMurderer	"The problem with this theory is the profile and psychology behind Steven Avery. Killers fall into two main categories (which of course are broken down further but these are the two main differences) of organized and disorganized. This theory has SA organized one moment, and disorganized the next and switches his profile several times. 

SA is a man with an IQ in the 70's, highly disorganized as seen in his home and workplace, and has never shown any of the planning and awareness of an organized killer. 

This theory has him cleaning the gun and placing it back into it's original place,  cleaning up blood, DNA and other forensic evidence, using plastic sheeting, removing his fingerprints, being in full control in a kidnapping and he is able to fully burn a human body knowing exactly how long and what type of fire he needs. This shows SA as organized and intelligent. 

However at other times during this theory we have him bleeding all over her car and not worrying about it which shows he also wasn't wearing gloves, he decides to place the body and car on his own property even after having her in another remote off-site location, he throws keys and a license plate in a random place instead of disposing of them properly, and he leaves her spare key on the bedroom floor of his trailer. 

To make this theory fit, you have to change SA's way of thinking and personality as well as his intelligence and skill level. It just isn't plausible that at one moment he is cleaning a crime scene and the murder weapon, and the next he leaves a body in the backyard and leaves blood all over her vehicle. 

And before the arguments of who knows why killers do the things they do, or that killers are dumb and make mistakes, I do agree with this. However profiling and criminal psychology are powerful tools in investigating and forensics, and this theory just doesn't fit SA's profile. 

Also I didn't see where this theory explained the spare key on the bedroom floor or the fact that her body could not have been burned in the fire-pit. Even if you believe it was, it doesn't fit with much of the theme of an organized killer or a killer who would move her bones, as no killer would move the bones to a more obvious and persecuting location. 

Tl;DR - Steven Avery can not be Dexter Morgan one minute, and a bumbling idiot the next. 

Edit: I also want to add using his past crimes to build a profile to debunk this theory. In none of his other crimes he was convicted of (ignoring the rape for obvious reasons) he never tried to destroy or hide evidence, nor was he able to hide and food law enforcement. He never showed this sort of planning and intelligence that would be required for this theory to work. If SA did murder someone, it would be very sloppy and very obvious what he had done, and he would not be able to go for so long without slipping up and either admitting his guilt or saying something that led to his guilt. "	He may have been disorganized but tried to cover his tracks as best he could. Which is to say he left a lot of incriminating evidence. Especially, the body remains just outside his house.

Primal boss chance is the best relic stat in terms of soul farming efficiency. Other abilities that add to capped ancients are also good.

Primal chance >>>>>>> Primal souls (if Solomon under ~5k) > Double rubies (if decently active/scripting) >= Hero cost >> Primal souls (if Solomon over ~5k) > 10x gold ~= Double rubies (if not very active) >> Treasure chests > Boss life > Skill durations ~= Primal hero souls (if Solomon over ~20k) >>>>>> Other things

Primal boss chance is by far the best relic stat, and should be the main attribute you should look out for. 4% primal boss chance alone beats 3% primal boss chance with every other possible attribute at max level, for example.

If the game gets significantly better after that planet, then the free trial failed to sell me on the game. It's mediocre up to that point, and while it's not terrible, there's some weird writing choices that take me right out of the moment. The rest is just not grabbing me. Sounds like another bad decision to stop the trial before it gets good, and I don't think it's worth buying yet on blind faith until it falls under $20. And, maybe not even then.

68	czjbtm8	czjcnp8	SquaredCircle	The main event is really good. It definitely takes a little while to really hit its stride as a show. 	"all said, i liked the main event.

i think that if it was on raw with maggle, jbl and byron/king i would have been completely uninterested.  the commentary team on LU is not the greatest, but striker and vampiro are reasonable good and helped me enjoy the match.  too much choreography and flippiness, which as i said is just not my cup of tea.  but solid work.

also, it helped that i had no clue what Puma's finisher would be and wasn't sure if Mundo is using his same old finisher from WWE.  so that added some element of suspense which improved the experience of the match.

it feels like it's too soon in the series to be bringing in the heel owner/authority figure storyline.  like, we don't even know the characters yet, it feels like this oculd have been a season one finale type of revelation or something, but whatever.....i'm not used to this format of seasons anyways, so i'm not going to get hung up on that.

Certainly be up front with them about being an atheist (if you don't, they'll consider you a potential investigator and will probably come back the next week), but I'm sure they'd appreciate just talking with someone. In fact, if you're feeling extra generous, maybe offer to let them call their families. Missionaries only get to call home twice a year, so getting this offer from (gasp!) an atheist would probably do more than any religious discussion you could have.	Oh they must have me flagged as an investigator then because the Mormon girls that stopped by last time have been by like 3 times this past month. They're sweet though and like I said, I enjoy talking to them. I told them I don't believe in God when they asked the first time they stopped by, so I guess they're just trying to help me see the light. I was very religious for a long time myself so I get where they're coming from and don't feel insulted or anything like a lot of people do.

But yeah, I think in this context the unisex bathroom was a way of reducing inequality. However, I think this was only because of the accountability. We all lived on the same floor, we had an RA responsible for our safety, and if anyone had done anything sketchy it would have been noticed by the whole floor. 

I think you don't get those advantages in a truly public bathroom. Public bathrooms aren't a place where a community meets. They're composed entirely of random strangers. I think it's the anonymity that creates the danger. 

So anyway this was super rambly but I just thought I would toss out the idea that maybe not all unisex bathrooms are a bad thing (but at a museum? Yeah that's pretty unfortunate)"	Yeah, that's closer to being something like a home bathroom that gets used by all the family.

\# 36 - Using the equilibrium law for the equation, Q = [PCl5]/[PCl3][Cl2], Q must equal 2.5 / 1.5, which is less than 2, or less than Kc. Since it is less than Kc, it must shift towards the product side to reach equilibrium.

Yea I don't really see an issue with it considering it is a mechanic available to literally everyone and requires no special skill. I don't love that aspect of playing in 3rd person, but I'm not really looking forward to first person only to be honest, other than maybe as a novelty. It will absolutely make for more tense combat so i totally understand the appeal, but a major portion of the time you're in the game is devoted to looting. I see being locked in first person as a huge drawback from that aspect that will make things much more tedious. I sometimes get a headache from all the camera motion when looting quickly in 3rd person... I can't imagine how bad things will be in first person only mode.
