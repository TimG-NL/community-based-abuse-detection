21	dgyp4ym	dgyws4m	BattleRite	There is still sustain in his M2, just on the round 3 battlerites instead. Wasn't it always from a battlerite? Because I'm missing something if it used to be baseline.	"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."
22		czj9shy	WeAreTheMusicMakers		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "

While it's true that some people have allergies to mold, and these vary in severity between people, immunocompromised people tend to be worse off, as they're prone to contracting fungal infections. But for most healthy people, it's just allergy-like symptoms.

The fact is that it's unnecessary and expensive to have the mold tested, even for ""black mold"" (*Stachybotrys chartarum*, or *Stachybotrys atra*). All mold infestations should be treated the same, and that's just to remove it yourself. If this is the only spot with mold that you know of, it's likely you can just clean this up and have no problem at all. If it is occurring in multiple places, maybe hire someone to inspect the house for it.

The CDC has a nice guide on how to deal with mold in your home - [you can find it here](https://www.cdc.gov/mold/stachy.htm).

96	czjawhw	czjezcv	LifeProTips	Actually, on some vehicles, especially older model chevy trucks, you have the ball on the bumper, so you would definitely haul things using the bumper. 	Now the bumper on that older Chevy is as stout as the frame on newer cars so there's that...
97	dkzjk3o	dkzwn2t	Guildwars2	"[Personal story spoilers](#s ""Instead of let Apatia die and bring back the orb, we should have saved Apatia and then let lots of people die at Fort Trinity because of no orb (Then again, the orb didn't even prevent Zhaitan's attack) and then have Apatia and the commander get barraged by friends and loved ones of the ones they didn't save, feel guilty and contemplate suicide.  
OR,  
they could have just had the friends and loved ones be completely broken and attack + berate the commander when you go to Hoelbrak to give Apatia her eulogy."") "	"The orb doesn't protect the Risen from attacking, it just prevents you from getting turned into a Risen. You got it to prevent your troops from being easy feed for Zhaitan's army and getting turned into psyche warfare tools. 

Which makes you wonder why the Risen didn't just storm the Krait fortress the good old fashioned way before....with the new reveals, it makes more sense now why Zhaitan would be so interested in the orb. The thing prevents Dragon magic from working, somehow. What does it even do, exactly?"
98	dgxakpo	dgyvn0h	FordFocus	For Under 3000, and I may be biased here since this is how I did it. Hit up auctions, see what you can get for 3 grand. I got mine for about 300 + auction fee, it had only done 75k miles, service history right up to 2015. Mk2s would probably be about a grand at the same mileage, maybe just under 2000 for one with REALLY good bodywork. If its your first car, and again, im probably biased, i would consider getting a Mk1, as they're slightly lighter, and the 1.8. its about 115 bhp so not so powerful as to send your insurance skyward, but fast enough you can push her, if youre inclined as such. The only issue with that is, you have to very lucky with the body condition on that one. I have however, seen a lot of really great examples that belonged to elderly drivers, who maybe only use them twice a week to go shopping or something, but still get them serviced every 6 months. Gawd bless the old dears!	Thank you for your advice, there is a car auction here but as far as I can tell they're mostly 'new' fleet cars - the sold as seen part of buying at a auction puts me off, if somethings wrong I'm kinda stuck.

103	dgyo169	dgz04r1	Dentistry	Just be careful with this strategy--CCs are pretty high risk.	I'm down to getting a second or third job to prevent being beaten down by loan interest rates.

108	czavddq	czjdkjr	Winnipeg	 Yep, that McD's was definitely the place to have birthday parties. http://imgur.com/lLiK8Uw this was my birthday and the pict was taken in the basement; not that you can tell though. I remember they were so nice they took me on a tour of the back where they cook the food, and even let me hand a drink out the drive thru window :)	I still have all those pumpkin buckets!
109	dkzs7q2	dkzwx1k	AskReddit	"""Randomly clapping and snapping fingers"" I don't think that gives off the impression you think it does.

111	czjeye1	czjg3uz	SandersForPresident	My calc 2 class has mandatory attendance. Miss 3 days before the withdraw deadline, and you're withdrawn. Miss 3 days past the deadline and you fail regardless of your grade in the class.	Damn. Must be a relatively small class? My classes were so large that keeping attendance would have been impractical.
112	dgyrp0v	dgyszqd	DIY	"Uh... My pointer finger? Just like, I tap it. 

I have an electric stove and sometimes if I can't tell when it's on... I'll simply tap it very fast with a finger. I don't find that I get burnt. I do feel that it is hot and I through the pot or pan on it at such a time. 

But what if it were red metal like that? What would happen?"	"People will ask you what happened to your finger and you'll have to say, ""what finger""? 

In all seriousness, you're looking at instantaneous 3rd degree burns at the minimum. "
113		dkzrru0	AskReddit		They fitted me for a night guard that I used every night for 8 years. It fucked my teeth, caused them to slowly separate and shift, so I had to pay $5,000 for Invisalign to correct my teeth.

116	cziylm1	czj9045	AdviceAnimals	[verwijderd]	As a Republican I pretty much agree with your assessment. Unfortunately Reddit only cares about the echochamber that says Bernie could actually win a general election. Believe me, I would love it if he was the nominee, nothing would make me happier than to put our candidate up against a Socialist for a slam dunk. Kinda like how reddit thinks Rand Paul has a shot at the Republican Nod...

At both places, we were required to remove all nozzles and soak them in a sanitizing solution for ten minutes then rinse with warm and cold water and dry them overnight. The machine itself was super down with sanitizing spray. 

Whole thing took maybe fifteen minutes per day to disassemble, clean, and reassemble in the morning. 

Be clean people. Come on. "	"Wow that's better than the place I worked at. We just soaked them in seltzer water overnight lol

121	dgy76bd	dgytciw	BannedFromThe_Donald	there really is a global pandemic of racism and authoritarianism right now, and i applaud you for showing up to stop the destruction of democracy, however unpalatable the available choices may be.	I'm assuming you're complimenting me and not the immediate parent thread. I appreciate it, I've got a lot of flak for choosing not to choose, from parents and coworkers and Reddit idiots. I didn't choose my president because my choices were poor, peer pressure doesn't affect me.

141	dkzuxhw	dkzuyji	MakeupAddiction	Not sure how you feel about indie brands, but Limnit is a brand that makes demi-matte to matte bullet lipsticks. They wear comfortably and, while aren't durable like a liquid matte, resist transfer well. [Punk'in](https://www.limnitlipsticks.com/product/punkin-bright-orange-semi-matte-opaque-vegan-lipstick) is their orange colour and I would say [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8-avBUM1KXU/VHl3Tc8dtQI/AAAAAAAAJ-s/83xH1E18GJ8/s1600/Limnit%2BLipsticks%2BPunk%27in.jpg) is a more true-to-life lip swatch than their site has.
