Swerves left, right and centre and not just stupid unpredictability, it was good unpredictability. Everyone was booked fairly strong, Shaesaro lost because of inexperience, Bayley lost because of a shoulder into the lower post (which sounded absolutely brutal), Randy lost because of Singh Bros and Jinder and Bray got his win and Jinder looks legit, and Roman actually lost for once.

""I found a few other fringe characters that meet my boring blue collar expectations. I ***CHOSE*** to keep these ones around because they meet my narrow minded view of the world."""	"Well yeah, it was my decision to give up on meeting anyone here. I didn't say otherwise. I have a low tolerance for fake people, so after some time, I stopped making the effort. Never let anyone close enough to me to find out if I was awful or not. It only takes one conversation to see how badly a person is TRYING to impress you, and I'm not of the type to TRY to impress anyone. That's pathetic.

I would say that people CHOSE to keep me around. I fucked up all my relationships with everybody during my 10 plus year drinking career. I gave everyone the chance to break it off cleanly, and I wouldn't have blamed them. If someone thought I had fucked up enough to the degree that they didn't want to associate with me, I never begged them, nor do I hold it against them. Most of my friends who have seen the best and worst of me. Guess they thought the best outweighed 10 plus years of being a shitty person though, because they CHOSE to remain friends."

They are all atheist except Kierkegaard but even he gives good advice about how to deal with anxiety when we realize the shit-storm of a world we live in. These philosophers try and teach what do in the face of the nihilistic meaningless world we live in, which when realized can really dampen ones mood. Hope this helps and good luck. Cheers

If you're talking about Haru as a person you might hang out with? Yeah, she's actually pretty cool.

In terms of writing, my biggest criticism is pacing. It's always been my contention that she should've been introduced as an NPC much earlier in the game so that we could get little snapshots of her personality or her opinions on current events.

Conversely, my biggest criticism of Makoto is that she gets a lot of the spotlight compared to other Thief characters.

No but really I hope Savage starts wins the SB in HOU, gets traded for a 1st and has a great, but not stellar, career. 
121	czjfopj	czjgdrm	CCW	"It's an interesting question because one seemingly possible outcome wouldn't be good for us carriers: petty crimes could get a lot more deadly.

Imagine there was a 50/50 chance someone you were going to, let's say mug, had a gun.  That'd be a significant increase from what it is today, but let's go with it.  Given that scenario, a perpetrator really has two choices:  (a) play the odds and go in unarmed, or (b) attack violently and swiftly to ensure their own safety, at the very possibly mortal expense of yours.

Now, the obvious retort is that someone that's just interested in your wallet may not be a violent criminal much of the time and will take option (c), which is to be dissuaded from the crime entirely.  Obviously, that's the possibility we who advocate carrying would say is the most likely, and certainly the most desirable.  I mean, it's certainly true that someone intend on mugging you isn't necessarily willing to go the next step of murdering you for the possibility of a few dollars.

But, some certainly may be.  And, if the economy took a nosedive and people were very desperate for example, an otherwise not life-threatening mugging might become a life-or-death thing because the mugger may decide it's better for them to shoot you in the back of the head and take your wallet then risk getting shot themselves.  If they're really that desperate for the money then the idea of killing someone for it may not seem as far-fetched as it once did, and if that's true then simply killing you before you have a chance to respond is in their best interests (to their warped mind I mean)."	That's when I take my family into the hills and take our chances with the animals.

And it won't operate for ten years - *solar is cheaper*. Coal is a *dying product*. Technology is moving on from coal-powered electricity grids, the same way we moved on from steam-powered trains.

This is the economic reality. Your whole act on this subreddit is pretending that you are the ""smart guy"" who ""faces the realities of economics"" (which by some bizarre coincidence always lines up with the Murdoch/Coalition party line) - so how can *you* justify promoting *coal*?

If we give a billion dollars to these scam artists we will *never* get it back. It's obvious. That's why the *banks* are refusing to back it. *Their* economic modelling, no doubt dismissed by the likes of you as ""lefty nonsense"", shows that the mine will be a failure.

And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of *any* objections. People don't act like that for no reason. Follow the money."	"Edit:  The downvotes on this just confirm that this place lives in a fantasy land.  It's hard to put into words how flat-out wrong the median opinion is.  It's honestly more sad than anything else.  How people can be so mis-informed is just beyond me.  I personally blame The Guardian and the sad lack of economics education in school.

I don't understand how someone can say something so flat-out wrong as:

&gt;f it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

And be taken seriously.  It's just amazing how little interest in reality this place has.

&gt;If it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

This is just wrong.  A flat out lie.  There is no evidence to suggest this and I don't know why you'd bother writing it out.

&gt;And it won't operate for ten years - solar is cheaper.

Solar and coal don't compete as solar is intermittent and requires large amounts of redundancy.  When solar is capable of running at all times we might be having a different conversation.

&gt;This is the economic reality.

No, it is not.  This is a lie to fit your priors.

&gt;Your whole act on this subreddit is pretending that you are the ""smart guy"" who ""faces the realities of economics"" (which by some bizarre coincidence always lines up with the Murdoch/Coalition party line) - so how can you justify promoting coal?

Because India lives in horrific poverty and coal allows them to rise out of it.  The 100% renewable study commissioned required India to be 1/7th as wealthy as us.  I'm not comfortable with consigning a sixth of the planet to abject poverty because they had the misfortune to develop after us.

Also yes, I do promote economic reality.  It should say something that I then line up with the LNP a whole heap more than the ALP.  Something about the ALP being a bunch of incompetent buffoons lying to the Australian people.

&gt;If we give a billion dollars to these scam artists we will never get it back.

Ok.  I'm not going to pay back my home loan.  That's how these things work lmao.

&gt; That's why the banks are refusing to back it.

They're refusing to back it because the federal ALP are refusing to back it.  This is known as sovereign risk.

&gt;Their economic modelling, no doubt dismissed by the likes of you as ""lefty nonsense"", shows that the mine will be a failure.

Then it will be a failure.  That's fine.  The infrastructure will not solely be used by Adani.

&gt;And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of any objections.

Reasonable objections have been met.  This is probably the most stringently regulated mine in the history of the world.

Every other objection requires it to be blocked through legislative fiat, which the party of free markets will not do.

Now people on discord think I'm foolish trying to help you since they keep saying you aren't open to change, so I'm offering to give you quirk ideas, hell I'll even come up with some quirks for you depending on what type of quirk you want and I'll help you with your stats as well plus with anything else you need. Please let me help you man.....becuase I'll tell you again if you go ahead and use ""Flower Spam"" again I won't be able to help you and I can give guarantee that you won't make in any tournament as long as you stitck to that op quirk "	"Nah is alright man thanks, i think is better to give up on this one if internet teach me something is that once you fuck it up there is no coming back people don't forget anything, thanks for ofering your help it's really apreciated but I think is better that I get down, if i'm not mistaken the Boku no hero fandom is not presisely known for being understanding (no meme rule, seriously?) 

You are an exception throught we need more people like you

I hate communities that do this kind of things, i can repair the quirk and even add or quit some things but you say is no use, that ""flower spam"" already has an stigma so it's going to be rejected even if it's good to go just because people hated the original... ok im done i'm not here for this shits thanks again man (or woman idk) but i'm done

Don't worry about ideas, i have several, i'm going to tell you something ""flower spam"" was the sixth on the list of possible quirks for this, i choose it because it was funny and really diferent to anything i see before, unique you can say, in a begining it was just that, spam flowers, useless right? but then i start thinking

¿Can flowers grow in any surface, or just in soil?

¿Can flowers grow in living beings? 

¿Another creation quirks use something to create things, they didn't appear from thin air, what does the flowers use? 

I like the idea, I began to plan things, start writing concepts, organizing my ideas, etc, four days later i was good to go and even then is incomplete

the other quirks i have planned we're rejected because 

a) they were to similar to other quirks, both from this page and from the series

b) they we're stupidly op

And since i write this another ideas came to my mind

Just three of the ideas i think off

Muscle presure: this quirk allows the user to put strain in their muscle compresing them allowing to use the 100% of the human muscle power or even increase it beyond the human limit, more than 100% 

Rejected because it was to similar to one for all, it's weakness even where that the strain the body goes after using the quirk break the users body

Golden form: the user can transform for several seconds into a special form that heavily increase the strength, agility, endurance, etc, and gives the power to fly, after it's use the user collapse from tireness

It is based on the súper saiyan yes, but I don't think it was that usefull, i wanted to create a quirk that can be use effectively in tandem alongside the users own capabilities, this was more like a ""last resort"" attack so no

Magnetization: the user can magnetize his body to atract metalic objects from his sourroundings to use them as weapon, armour etc, he needs to be carefull or otherwise the objective can travel to fast an knock him down with a powerfull blow

To boring

Anyway hope i see you around, again thanks for anything"

146	dgyt9zo	dgz173f	magicTCG	"I'm the player who won this GPT. (what's up s. ) There are a lot of politics that are unmentioned in this post. All of the regulars in the top 8 are favorites at the shop are part of an in-crowd. I, another player and OP, are all friends and have tested and played a bit over the last few months. I am local but have been struggling lately with being ostracized by some of the members of the community. 

This is my local shop but it is not OPs. The judge is co-owner and son of the shop owner. The shop owner has been difficult over the last few months and was frustrated that so few people came to the GPT. The only people that came were locals (plus OP who was local but has recently moved away) so the event was smaller than he expected. I believe that that favoritism played the biggest role in this. I can't imagine anyone else in the event would have this rule applied to them except OP wasn't local. 

The honest truth from my perspective, is I dodged the hardest match-up in the quarter-finals because of this, and was able to role to the finals easier because of this. "	TBH, you need to report this with the judge feedback form. The judge needs to be warned and informed of the correct policy. This needs to be corrected and the judge needs to be talked to my his regional coordinator. The judge staff will need to be replaced as a first step. This stuff doesn't go unnoticed, I assure you.
