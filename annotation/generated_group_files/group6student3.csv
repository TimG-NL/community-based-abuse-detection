21	dgyp4ym	dgyws4m	BattleRite	There is still sustain in his M2, just on the round 3 battlerites instead. Wasn't it always from a battlerite? Because I'm missing something if it used to be baseline.	"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."
22		czj9shy	WeAreTheMusicMakers		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "

0 wins... discounting your 1 free win.

That deck isn't that clunky, I'd argue. Math is hard and I'm a bit drunk so here's the simplified, perhaps mangled version. You've got 9 cards that are playable by turn 1 and 2 (no stampede, explosive trap, etc, just minions). Drawing 1 of them makes you happy as a hunter. By turn 1 you've got a 43% chance to draw at least 1 of those 9 cards. Excluding 2 drops, you've got a 37% chance to draw a playable 1 drop by turn 1.

Statistically you should've landed a curve pretty often. All you had to do with this deck was stall until you meme them out of the game. What went so wrong?"

101	dgyum8z	dgyvz6f	Overwatch	I only play QP and that's because I only play Bastian. I don't like getting flamed for it and that's exactly what will happen in competitive. No thanks. 	Can't be flamed if you turn off voice and chat. 
102	dgyyp0p	dgz2273	Patriots	im black too then.... but seriously he isn't even remotely black 	His mother is white and his father is part black
103	dgyw8yq	dgz0x6y	PrequelMemes	I have brought vetoes, filibusters, gerrymandering, and subpoenas to my new Democracy!	Your new democracy?
104	dkzo32y	dkzo3vt	AskReddit	thedipshit (aka thedonald)	gottem
105	czjb837	czjbwc2	MMA	No it wouldn't. I love Hunto but Jones would pound the shit out of him at the end of his range for 5 rounds and eventually finish him. No fun what so ever.	i think it is more likely jon would take him down and tap him in the first round or tko him with gnp
106	dkzrckp	dkzsvgc	AskReddit	As does Dark Crystal.	I saw it elsewhere on the thread, but yes.  However, I would lean towards Labyrinth being a little more fucked up due to the sexual tension between a centuries old goblin king and the 16-year-old girl he is tormenting and those fire bird things.  I have no explanation for those things.
107	dgyy2hw	dgz232m	SULeaks	ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!?! THAT CLIFFHANGER WAS NOT OKAY.	It's funny how well timed it was.
108	czj8sob	czj8xe6	AdviceAnimals	And? Normal is normal for the area. You're asking a bunch of questions for not a lot of information. Jump to your point im growing tired of this game.	My point is that it's *incredibly* expensive to put people to death already (even more expensive and much, much more time consuming than putting them away for life). Putting all murderers to death would cost many-billions of dollars more than the current system in place. 
109	dkzr17o	dkzr6t6	RocketLeague	"Study finds the other 20% are people that don't score.

No citation needed."	"Study finds that 100% of those 20% spam ""What a save!"" when their teammate scores.

No citation needed."
110		czjbc64	Xcom		I have that light. It's pretty entertaining. 
111	dkzgwtq	dkzoe1v	Wishlist	"> 3242 U

Ooh, that's gorgeous!

>872 metallic gold

I can only find 871. And I don't like it D:

Our brand color is 7479 U."	[This is 872.](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/872-C)  It looks like puke on screen but is really quite gorgeous in print.
112	dgyy91x	dgyzkt6	AskReddit	King almost died when hit by a van before the last 3 dark tower books had been released!! 	Anybody got that van driver's number? Could use the same trick. 
113	czj76h6	czj8us5	AskReddit	[verwijderd]	What do you do and how do I do it too?

115		dkzrzin	AskReddit		If you wouldn't say something to your best friend, don't say it to yourself, either, because you're the best friend you'll ever have. 
116	czi96wn	czjdscm	40kLore	It likely wouldn't be used like a regular sword. Seems like it should be used 2 handed, maybe held and thrust sideways into the enemy or used more like an axe or maybe a scythe or something. It's definitely confusing, but what do you expect from a race that has pretty much been high for 10,000 years?	Incubi are an aspect shrine(of sorts), they kind of stay outside of most parts of the Dark Eldar lifestyle.
117		dgyzakj	uncensorednews		Have you ever seen a person of color underwater? That's because it's where white people hold all their KKK rallies. 
118	czj4f7l	czj4hgx	PS4	At this point, it's probibly pointless. 5 hours until it's over.	I thought it got extended 24 hours or am i incorrect on that?
119		dgyuwd7	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon		"Got caught in a massive downpour earlier with my SO. 💗 That was a thing that was fun.

I'm really disliking the new Android update. Too much changed at once."
120		czj5ab8	AskReddit		"Around 14. Had felt terrible for years, but didn't know what depression was.
2006 was a shitty year so I got some help. Got some meds that year.
Took a break from them from 2011-2013 and that was horrible. So I started taking them again and feel good :)"

130		dgz28n5	AskReddit		Cinnamon.
131		czjadgi	Multicopter		3.4V usually, still well over the safe minimum voltage for a LiPo cell so there's enough buffer to land safely.
132		czjdusq	Canadian_ecigarette		Another RX! One of us, one of us, one of us.
133		dkzyh3m	BigBrother		Cody may be an ignorant asshole but he's not a bully, that we've seen.
134	cxkhki1	czje9nr	Dixie	"Thank you sir. An excellent post.

It's kind of unfortunate that my girlfriend, who is not from NC natively, has told me, ""Sir/ma'am"" is unnecessary and awkward, thus wouldn't want to raise potential children saying it. After some convincing she realized it's a respect thing. But how could anyone find fault in that?

I love your overall gist of ""the majority is not always correct."" It's completely true. I also must realize that where I am for work is in a liberal area of the state. It doesn't necessarily reflect everyone, everywhere, in the state itself.

What irks me most is when I hear younger folks say they want to lose their accent. Why in the WORLD?"	Why would anyone ever want to lose their accent? I don't have an accent, and I'm jealous of all of the rest of y'all!
135		czjed08	Naruto		"Best Ninjutsu: Kaguya, I mean shes the goddess of chakra

Best Taijutsu: Guys 8 gates

Best Genjutsu: Itachis Tsukuyomi

Best Summoner: Jiraiya with his toads

Best Summon: When Sasuke summons that snake to save himself from Deidara, I don't remember the whole explanation but it saved his life so I'd say its a pretty important one.

Best Hokage/Kage: Hashirama by power but I really liked Minato, I thought his kunai teleportation stuff was really cool.

Best Teammate: Neji :(

Best Character Growth: This could go to so many people but I'm gonna avoid just giving it to the MC and say Gaara.

Best Shinobi: Kakashi, always willing to sacrifice for his village and friends, never afraid to fight to protect what he loves. Very wise and was given the task of trying to guide Sasuke and Naruto which was difficult given ones clan was slaughtered and the other was the nine tails jinchuuriki.

Best Kunoichi: Tsunade, very tough woman and the only female Hokage, one of the three legendary Sannin.

Best jutsu: Madaras Tengai Shinsei based on power, but I did really like Sasuke's rinnegan power in the Boruto movie(Amenotejikara )where he's able to teleport from one space to another in an instant.

Best Arc: Chunin Exams were alotta fun first time around. Either that or the Pain arc.

Best Villian: Tobi, very mysterious and powerful.  I remember being on the edge of my seat during his fight with Minato.  ""I could say I did it on a whim, or that I planned it, or that its war...or that its for peace"" - one of my favorite lines in the series.

Best Fight: This is so hard to choose.  My personal favorite was Kakashi vs Obito in the Kamui dimension.  Animation and emoitions were so high during the fight.  Itachi vs Sasuke is a close second, very tactical fight and a lot of fun to see unfold.

136	dkzgcgc	dkzozv9	AskReddit	">Nah, fuck it. When I'm a dad, I'm breaking the cycle and letting the colorful language fly.

This is what we've done with our son, He understands that we don't mind if he says any of the words except ""Fuck"" (my wife just wasn't having it) - so he can say ""Bitch, Asshole, Dickhead, Twat"" etc. and we don't care, he understands that this is a unique thing in our family, and that other families consider this kind of language to be a non-starter (especially when we live in Utah, surrounded by mormons). 

So far, we've only had trouble with the school once, when he told some kid who was bullying him to Fuck off, and the school sent home a letter with him explaining the situation which we were supposed to sign and return (To confirm we'd acknowledged the issue). I flipped the damn thing over, and wrote ""My son wouldn't have to use such strong language if that other kid wasn't such a cunt.""

His school doesn't contact me anymore, they go to my wife if they need something.


Edit: To clarify, he did get in trouble for using the ""Fuck"" word, but I wasn't too angry because he was standing up to a bully."	"Weird that your wife stops at fuck, sounds like you're British, guess the culture's different?

As an Aussie, fuck can be one of the least offensive swear words and one of the most versatile. I use it casually all the time, though probably too much."
137	czjdrv2	czje5oc	TheWitness	I think your spoilers are backwards.	"What do you mean?  I tried to give a hint, then put a more direct, specific hint as the spoiler.  

Edit:  My spoiler on Number 1 is wrong, though.  His perspective does seem off, but the spoiler is for the next puzzle I think.  "
138	dkz5lca	dkzwi33	EasternSunRising	"lol, and u/Bennelong is there. Of course. 

Most people in those default subreddits are fucking scum."	He's the biggest China-bashing shill on Reddit, lol.
139	cziy7vx	czjf3f5	WTF	"It's likely bile. I bet the poor guy wouldn't eat after swallowing the rubber toy, so the vet induced vomiting. All that would come up on an empty stomach would be bile, with maybe a slight bit of half digested puppy chow.

Yes I'm trying to retain my love of mustard with this post."	I hate how bitter it is. Bad enough dry heaving long enough that bile comes up, it could at least be fairly flavorless. 
140	dgy3fnd	dgz0zsc	WTF	Yeah I really should buy a window hammer...	$18 knives that you find at most every truck stop. Assisted open blade, window punch, and seatbelt cutting blade built into handle. 
141	czhkok4	czj5099	DestinyTheGame	POGO POGO POGO POGO POGO!	She had so many friends
142		czj8ode	Showerthoughts		I would hope they get cremated and discarded. 
143		czj7szp	Truecels		Women don't want relationships or kids. A lot of them just want to have sex. As in an orgasm with a man. That is not a bad thing and that means she isn't driven by any sort of biology, she is driven by whatever she finds attractive which is usually a big dick, nice face, and nice strong arms to hold her up against a wall and fuck her.
