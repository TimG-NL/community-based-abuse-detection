The past 30 days has seen the Euro (Finlands currency) weaken from about 1.13201EUR:1USD to it's current 1.18433EUR:1USD This is not quite 5%, but still fairly significant.

Currently NOK is at 5.38 Euro, which would be 6.39 USD. On US exchange, $NOK ADR is $5.36. This is within 1% of the exchange rate. 

If you overlay the NYSE and the HEL charts, around june 30th the NYSE ADR appears to be doing better. That is because from the period of June 26th to the 30th, the Euro weakened considerably vs the USD ~1.8%

In addition to currency exchange rates, the discrepancies in the highs and lows can be explained by the timing of news releases. Generally the Helsinki exchange and the NYSE track each other within a few percent, but Nokia releases many PR and their earnings reports after market close in Helsinki, which is premarket in the US. United states then gets the pops which level off by the time Helsinki market opens.

There is also most likely a difference in perception of the company between European and American investors to take in to account.

tl;dr

Yes, mostly currency, ""Idiot."" If you can't be arsed to do the math and research yourself, don't get childish and shitty with those who are trying to point you in the right direction."	You're wrong. It is down 8.5% from its peak in Helsinki compared to 2.3% in the NYSE.

Seoul responded to Trump's comments by saying that under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it. Do you have any evidence that that statement is false? You say the THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA. THAAD is no exception. 	"Did you even read what I wrote? Or are you just trying to strawman me? 

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it. 

&gt;THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

Example: if a car dealer sells a car he must include a warranty under law, so that sale is covered by law, but then if the dealer says no actually you have to pay an extra $x or i'm not delivering that car he can do that and is not violating any law."

I disagree. Knowing that the studios are driven to seek the highest return for their film means they'll constantly be searching for corners to cut. VFX has been one of those corners for a long time, and the fact that there hasn't been union representation has helped that. Establishing union agreements for the industry will change that.  
 
When that happens, they'll continue to try to make their product for the cheapest possible and sell it for as much as possible, as many times as possible. It just won't be on the backs of the VFX artists and studios any longer."	"I honestly don't think we have the same understanding of supply side economics. You essentially agree with me that the studios will seek to make their movies and games as cheaply as possible but you don't see that as a barrier to unionization or the studios seeking cheaper ""scab"" vendors as a potential result.

This seems like the most important point. Games just rarely go that late anymore (assuming average to high MMR games).

That said, it doesn't impact me too much, unlike the removal of FotMâ€”with right masteries, you used to be able to get 40+ regen by stacking health regen tank items (FotM + SV + Guardian's Hammer), all for just 6k in gold, and can conditionally bypass Warmog's in favor of other items that are more useful in team fighting.

I am _really_ curious how the midseason update next week is going to affect the tank and bruiser builds, though, especially with the addition of those two superb tank items (Adaptive Helm for anti-skill and DoT spamming mages, and Gargoyle for multi-man resistance gains). For one, I expect the likes of Cass and Teemo to see some drop in win rate over the next few weeks."	"I think a big reason for me is on most AD tanks/bruisers i can usually utilize regen. If there's a few enemy AP's i can build visage and titan hydra. Lots of ap add banshee's. 

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of? 

Idk you could come up with something fun and balance-able."

109	dgyqryz	dgyu8q2	NeutralPolitics	"Your analogies aren't comparable though. I mean swimming is probably the closest, because it can be dangerous, and you might find a pool at your friends house, but swimming has been taught in schools. However you don't go over to a friend's house and find a rock wall high enough to seriously injure you and a bicycle doesn't kill you if you sit on it wrong. 

I make the sex ed argument again. Would you say ""don't have sex"" is a good enough sex education? No because it's not. People are going to have sex. Guns are cool and when kids (and adults) see them they want to look at them and touch them, even if they know they shouldn't. Yes you teach not to play with the gun, but you should teach how to safely handle one in case they do anyway. "	"&gt;However you don't go over to a friend's house and find a rock wall high enough to serriously injure you and a bicycle doesn't kill you if you sit on it wrong.

You are far more likely in life to encounter steep drops then guns. 

And more likely to encounter a bike than a gun.

So your saying it makes more sense to just avoid those things if your not trained to use them correctly and safely?  You should avoid the edges of sharp drops, and not ride a bike in the street?  A rock wall isn't the only thing a kid might try to climb.  trees, buildings, bluff faces, fences...  shall I go on?

Kinda like you shouldn't handle a gun, and the solution is the same thing, but for one you want mandatory training?  So rather than waste money so morons can be justified not locking their guns up properly, how about we continue to teach kids not to touch them.  It works for most children, after all, its the exception, not the rule, to have a kid playing with a live gun."

Truth of the matter is that this woman had no idea whether this was the case or not, only presumed the cop guilty, and she herself drove distracted shooting video while admittedly speeding, endangering everyone around her that she so self-righteously claimed to be protecting from a speeding cop.  

Get off your high horse. Nobody anointed you into some police oversight position. Drive safely to the station (you passed right by it off I-95) and file a formal complaint with the desk sergeant if you're so concerned. "	Seriously, she even says in the video that she has the the police car's vehicle number. She doesn't even have to go out of her way and drive to the station, she can just call them at home and report a dangerous driver. I guess speeding while filming a youtube video meant more to her than solving the issue in a safe manner.,

115		dkzporv	ADHD		"I'm dual diagnosed.  Was on Vyvanse for 1.5 years, till I realized it was making me panicky and jittery...  (Think panic attack but the entire day...  But I just thought it was stress, since I only really take it during the academic year.)  It also was messing with my sleep, I think.  (I've never complained about it, thus never diagnosed, but anxiety is typically comorbid in ASD.  And Vyvanse is known to exacerbate anxiety in people who have anxiety issues.)

Since they are so often found together (ASD/ADHD + anxiety), I'd probably look more at how the meds affect people with anxiety (if this is also a problem for you), rather than how ADHD meds affect people with ASD.

No side-effects on Adderall (XR and IR), though it doesn't give me the energy that Vyvanse does.  I kind of wish I could combine them, but my psych said no.  :(  lol

Neither medication ever left me ""hyper,"" and both increased focus.  Though Adderall doesn't quite work as well as Vyvanse for me in that regard...  It's all about how each med affects you, specifically, because everyone's biology is different -- even if we have the same disorders. 

As an aside, even people who *don't* have ADHD or similar will still usually get increased focus from stimulants. "

Don't get me wrong I am tempted to pay the $10 to try it out for a month... but I don't particularly trust BPG to run the game properly, and to be honest I can get the same thrills I use to get in DF in other games that are not nearly as life draining.

I just don't want to watch the game slowly die again, be it from the game simply being out of touch with what the MMO crowd expects or because BPG runs it into the grounds.

--------------

Before you say anything I have the same predictions for DnD.  I think both are doomed projects, although each I have different thoughts on why / how.

The only hope this game has for a decent launch is a lot of the old vets like me looking at it and thinking ""$10 is worth a month of revisiting DF crack""."

126	dgyvvij	dgyxcb3	ClashRoyale	Goblin gang, zap, log, skarmy, skelly (keep those tho), thombstone, cannon, ice golem, and ice spirit to name a few	"I agree with Log, Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, Skeletons, Cannon and Ice Spirit being very powerful for their costs. 

I personally think Ice Golem is good where it's at, as a cheap mini tank/distraction unit/skeleton killer who does very little damage and no longer has a ridiculously large frost nova.

Cannon itself isn't too strong in my opinion, it's just that it's too similar to Tesla and thus replaces it any time someone looks to add a non-Inferno tower defensive building. To me, the solution is to buff Tesla, maybe by allowing it to hit two targets like Ewiz (no stun effect) and slowing it's hit speed accordingly so that it's DPS doesn't get insanely good.

Tombstone I feel is fine, definitely an annoying card especially if you're using Hog Rider or Elite Barbarians, but it's low hitpoints make it reasonably strong against ground tanks and troops. Maybe a slightly slower stream of Skeletons would be good, but that might kill the card's usage entirely.

Zap is a weird one because for the longest time it provided too much value, but after the damage nerf I think it's found a good niche as a reset card and Skeleton Army killer. The problem with Zap of being an easily overleveled common won't disappear unless the developers address that problem, so unfortunately overleveled Zaps will continue to be a nuisance. But in challenges, Zap is pretty balanced because it doesn't kill too much and the duration of it's stun isn't too long. The most frustrating part about going against Zap is how quickly it's deployed when compared to Arrows, which did receive the deploy time buff recently but still feel considerably slower. So perhaps a slight nerf?

Let me know what your reasoning was with the cards you mentioned!"
