1	dkztc5x	dkztrvd	AskReddit	"I guess I'm a little different there but I totally understand it. I can definitely spend longer periods by myself, but if I'm in the house for more than a couple days I get really antsy and then need to go outside. If there is any sort of big outdoor project I've got going on, I can definitely stay on my property alone as long as I can be active outside.

"	I'll go outside in the backyard often, unless it's winter, and just hang out with my dogs. And I enjoy going out and doing things, going to the library, the coffee shop near my house, the farmers market, or even the mall, but I can be perfectly content just being at the house.  Dealing with people can be exhausting, especially when it's ride or stupid people haha. 
2	dgz1102	dgz2dso	EliteDangerous	Small ships only sounds shit. And the amount of time in between each date is huge. 2 days to travel 500 light years? That's doable in 15 minutes. 	"The goal behind having small ships only is twofold: 1 is a very affordable expedition so many new players can easily join in, and 2 is to provide an interesting alternative to the traditional ""aspaconda"" expeditions. It gives a challenge to people to try and engineer their ass off with the small ships. It was a huge success last year (we had over 300 people register when we were expecting 50), and was a real blast. Sometimes quite literally."

I said you were not answering my question about the game being broken 4 months after release because you're one of SDS's favorite streamers. Your messages proved that. All the other messages are just your word against mine, what you saw versus what I saw. I don't give a shit if you're here now or not.

5	dkzpr1z	dkzsdzm	Android	You might want to give a bit more info than that? What specifically didn't you like about the OP5 reviews?	"The complaints that turned me off the most were with OnePlus not the phone itself. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with. In addition, the customer support is shotty, but that can be anecdotal although it still does worry me. The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much. 

All in all, I am just trying to shop around for comparable phones and was wondering if there was something similar or more powerful than the OP5 whether the price is higher or not."

The key to the build is Lillith. It's the bio card and and it's your main source of damage. Be warned that this build takes a long time but it's safe.

37	dgycgre	dgys7fk	Bestbuy	"Am I the only one who thinks these accommodations are BS? Like, last year, you just printed off a coupon and only once they were all used (or mostly used, I suspect) was the coupon pulled. Now they put up X (1,000 in this instance, apparently) coupons via the Learning Network, and once those are ""claimed"" the offer is gone. And yet, 800 of those people may never use the coupon. 

Last years Samsung Accom lasted for like *four or five months*. This one lasted for like four or five *hours* (well... ten hours, but still). \*facepalm\*"	Yes it is bs because with only 1,000 coupons and 1,026 stores there are entire stores that didn't get even one. I thought that the point of the accommodations program was to allow employees to have better knowledge of and experience with the products that they sell. So how are we going to get that real world knowledge when only 0.8% of all the employees nationwide have a shot at a coupon?
38	czba7se	czj6ui0	MakingaMurderer	"The problem with this theory is the profile and psychology behind Steven Avery. Killers fall into two main categories (which of course are broken down further but these are the two main differences) of organized and disorganized. This theory has SA organized one moment, and disorganized the next and switches his profile several times. 

SA is a man with an IQ in the 70's, highly disorganized as seen in his home and workplace, and has never shown any of the planning and awareness of an organized killer. 

This theory has him cleaning the gun and placing it back into it's original place,  cleaning up blood, DNA and other forensic evidence, using plastic sheeting, removing his fingerprints, being in full control in a kidnapping and he is able to fully burn a human body knowing exactly how long and what type of fire he needs. This shows SA as organized and intelligent. 

However at other times during this theory we have him bleeding all over her car and not worrying about it which shows he also wasn't wearing gloves, he decides to place the body and car on his own property even after having her in another remote off-site location, he throws keys and a license plate in a random place instead of disposing of them properly, and he leaves her spare key on the bedroom floor of his trailer. 

To make this theory fit, you have to change SA's way of thinking and personality as well as his intelligence and skill level. It just isn't plausible that at one moment he is cleaning a crime scene and the murder weapon, and the next he leaves a body in the backyard and leaves blood all over her vehicle. 

And before the arguments of who knows why killers do the things they do, or that killers are dumb and make mistakes, I do agree with this. However profiling and criminal psychology are powerful tools in investigating and forensics, and this theory just doesn't fit SA's profile. 

Also I didn't see where this theory explained the spare key on the bedroom floor or the fact that her body could not have been burned in the fire-pit. Even if you believe it was, it doesn't fit with much of the theme of an organized killer or a killer who would move her bones, as no killer would move the bones to a more obvious and persecuting location. 

Tl;DR - Steven Avery can not be Dexter Morgan one minute, and a bumbling idiot the next. 

Edit: I also want to add using his past crimes to build a profile to debunk this theory. In none of his other crimes he was convicted of (ignoring the rape for obvious reasons) he never tried to destroy or hide evidence, nor was he able to hide and food law enforcement. He never showed this sort of planning and intelligence that would be required for this theory to work. If SA did murder someone, it would be very sloppy and very obvious what he had done, and he would not be able to go for so long without slipping up and either admitting his guilt or saying something that led to his guilt. "	He may have been disorganized but tried to cover his tracks as best he could. Which is to say he left a lot of incriminating evidence. Especially, the body remains just outside his house.

So you think thousands or millions of illegal residents risked felony charges and deportation to vote, when 12 million Latino *citizens* didn't even show up? All of them had 2 valid forms of ID, got SoCal gas utilities, and then swore under penalty of perjury that they were citizens? And they did all that without leaving even a single piece of evidence that they did it? That would have to be extremely coordinated, and if you're gonna put that much effort into it why not just get actual citizens to show up?

Some men like us think they miss freedom and parties and ex girlfriends and young women but that's not it at all. 

What we miss is ourselves, that feeling at 16 and 18 and 21 that we were ready to take on the world, and we couldn't wait to stick our dicks into the whole world and watch it cum. Confidence for days. Chiseled abs. Pecs that made the girls gasp when we took our shirts off. We had it all but somewhere along the line it went away.

73	czj6ea5	czjc661	AskReddit	"Well.... a few years ago my best friend at the time got mad at me, and went sort of crazy, for getting a boyfriend (the first guy I was actually serious about). She and I were living together (separate bedrooms) attending college and she was so weird about it that she didn't even want to be there if he was there and would leave the apartment any time he was over and text me wondering when he was gone. Keep in mind I would only see him every other weekend because he was also attending school at the time.

She started to get crazy and told various lies to my mom like I had been drinking and driving among other things when I hadn't. Oh and she told my mom I was having sex so that made things awkward. She kept feeding my mom lies and it ruined my relationship with my mom for awhile too.

She also essentially tried to turn all of our mutual friends at the time against me and became the new best friend to the person I hated most. They would search through my room and my stuff when I wasn't there too.

It sounds like something out of a Mean Girls kind of plot but it really sucked at the time. This all started right around when we moved in together so I had to deal with it for an entire year until our lease was up. I didn't find out about the room/stuff searching with my arch nemesis or her telling my mom a ton of lies until later on, but I had my suspicions. She and I have been friends for a long time but ever since that it just hasn't been the same really. We still talk and everything. Oh and I'm still with the same guy too."

89	dgyxho6	dgyzbiy	AskReddit	"Not true, what im going to say next sounds counterintuitive, but would be effective in taking the power and money out of the hands of people that wield that much power and influence.

Legalize drugs,  tax them, and take the money earned for taxing the drugs and put it toward rehab centers for people with drug problems.  Contrary to popular belief,  people who are addicted to drugs, are going to do drugs, and have much deeper problems  than the drugs they are addicted to.  If you offer them, safe, regulated places to buy and take the drugs,  you cut down significantly the amount of money el chapo is making.  

And with a national treatment center, funded by the people buying the drugs,  those people who need the help can get it.  

Those who are using them for recreational purposes will also fund the rehab centers. 

We as a society can insure those who use drugs might not die from bad drugs, and that those with real problems can get help.

Oh also,  people that control govts with drug money will be out of business and power.  

EDIT:

Winning a war on drugs in itself is an unattainable goal, as drugs will be done,  its in the nature of humans to use substances to escape stress/monotony/problems.  The war on drugs created the environment that the people OP mentioned can thrive in. If we remove that environment,  we remove them. "	The only way we win the war on drugs is to stop thinking of it as a war and start thinking of it as a social issue.

107	czjf8s0	czjfod2	AskReddit	I'm more confused after reading your comment. Could you please explain what that sentence literally means? Finish last what?	Finish last, i.e., don't get what they want. Usually this is in reference to dating. Stereotypically the asshole gets the girl, and she kicks the nice guy to the curb. The last sentence is saying that it is not the nice guys that are not getting what they want, but the boring guys. You can be nice and interesting and easily attract a mate. You can be mean and interesting and attract a mate. If you are boring and uninteresting, it doesn't matter how nice you are, you are not likely to get the mate you desire.

The 180 shutter is based on frame rate. At 60fps a 180 shutter is 1/120 second, whereas at 24 fps it's 1/48 second, a much bigger difference in motion blur.

My suggestion is: shoot anything you think will be slowed down at 60 fps. Shoot everything you know will be regular speed at whatever frame rate you're delivering in. If you're unsure, shoot both."

Once upon a time there was an 18 year old man who really *really* loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it.

Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her.

'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love.

Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well.

Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak.

The man knew what he had to do.

""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything! The wedding was saved!

""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment.

""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan.""

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.
