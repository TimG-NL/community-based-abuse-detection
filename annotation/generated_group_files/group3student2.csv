2	dgyvzzi	dgyxqum	AskThe_Donald	If we welcome those people and they follow through on those beliefs then they will be tried and sent to prison or deported, whatever the case may be. Natural born citizens also have some crazy ideas on occasion but just because someone wants to kill a black man for marrying a white woman, doesn't mean the law is going to change to allow that. But I don't know just believe what you want and keep voting in line with it. I'm tired.	"This is a Democracy, it only takes %3 to sway an election, we are at %1 now.

But it is far more than that.  Look what happened in Turkey.  Islamists used to be %10 of the population 70 years ago (about the same as France today), now Ergodan, who was voted in Democratically, is firing and imprisoning secular judges and military officials and changing the constitution to make Turkey an Islamic nation.

The Muslim brotherhood itself has a very clear agenda to implement the same thing in the west, and many Imams talk openly about it,including ""outbreeding the infidels"".  

The same thing that happened in Turkey will happen in Europe, and then the gays will be executed legally, as is currently done in the Middle East.."

I agree with everything you said. Imo the ADO events cater towards the recreational dart player and it just so happens some of them are REALLY good at playing darts for American players. 

There might be a few examples that count as ""professional"" but it's fairly rare. I won't name any names but there was a VERY well known US player that won 3 Dartslive events several years ago to the tune of 12 grand each. Plus he had a contract with a Japanese company that was quite lucrative. But that's just a one off example. "	"I started the thread as it was my first tournament setting of any kind. I don't disagree with you at all. We had the same discussion while we were there. It was cool to see the US World Cup Duo (Butler and Young) play since I just watched them a few months ago. Those are the only two I considered pros (semi professional really). I had a lot of fun but you could tell there were a lot of ""shirts"" that weren't that great. I did get destroyed in the singles cricket by a shirt though.

38	czj26jr	czj46cy	Watches	"Ah, gotcha. No, that's normal. Under certain conditions, tritium lume will puff up. 

Some people attribute the puffiness to moisture having gotten into the case at some point because tritium expands when it gets wet, but with how good of condition yours is in, I kind of doubt that water has ever gotten in there. I'd seriously doubt it's a re-lume. Does it glow at all? For a watch from the mid 60s, you'd either expect no glow at all, or a very faint glow for a short amount of time.

Thanks! You have a seriously great watch. I'd say wear it. Unless your job is seriously dangerous for watches, I'd go for it. It's a tool watch after all. Best way to enjoy it is on the wrist :)

39		czj8dpo	Aquariums		"This is a Finnex 12x12x12 cube that came with a Planted+ light.  I had this tank set up before, and had issues with algae (the light is strong for the tank, and sits very close to the top.)  
  
I wanted to add some snails to the tank, and wanted a lid to keep them from escaping.  I also wanted to slow evaporation (I have very hard water, and hate the calcium lines I get), and keep the bubbles from the sponge filter from popping and splashing on my monitor.  
  
I went through a couple samples and tests and ended up with this.  It was printed with PET+ (basically same stuff plastic water bottles are made up of) which is hydrophobic - so I'm not too concerned about toxins or breakdown.   Pretty happy with the results.

44	czjf6t5	czjf9u6	DestinyTheGame	"My wish list for the Crucible:

• Double the spawn time of special and heavy. 
• Add just a little more flinch to snipers.
• Reduce aim assist on all snipers.
• Bring Thorn's damage in-line with legendary weapons. The DoT should be what makes it exotic, but it shouldn't do so much extra damage. 
• Bring TLW's damage more in-line with legendary weapons. This thing is way too strong. 4 body shots for a kill, and 2 to the head (hipfire). This thing shoots faster than MIDA and doesn't even require headshots for a fast time to kill. Reduce the extra damage. 
• Since TLW gets bonus damage while hipfiring, shouldn't First Curse at least get some sort of bonus damage while First Curse perk is active? Why can TLW kill someone with max armor in 2 shots, but First Curse can't? (Assuming TLW doesn't get nerfed.)
• High impact auto rifles need crit damage increased. Higher impact autos should have the farthest range as well. 
• Focus Fire perk on high impact autos should make crits at a minimum of 39, and not the current (33).
• High impact pulse rifles should be restored to their former damage. 
• Fusion rifles should be effective outside of shotgun range. I'd say about double the range is good. Tightening stability goes hand to hand with effective range. 

I know it's a pretty ridiculous list, but I think I'd actually be able to enjoy the Crucible if these changes were implemented. We *need* variety. I'm just tired of being killed by the same six weapons every game. TLW, Thorn, MIDA, 1000-Yard, Party Crasher, and Harrowed Quillim's Terminus.

Edit: Of course I get downvoted because nobody agrees with a TLW rebalance. I've been on the receiving end of that weapon for a year now and I can say that I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was already perfectly balanced. "	"I think these are all good except the TLW nerf. It's a shell of its former self, and it just straight up dies outside of, like, twenty feet. I never feel like I've been unfairly killed by it any more. If I get melted, I had it coming.

If it gets nerfed again, it becomes unusable, and I don't think that's necessary."

82		dkzoks7	WorldofTanks		"*popcorn*
"
83	dkzpitu	dkzq83j	AskReddit	Kinda the same since they got to realize how disappointing you were at the time and then reminded of it when they hooked up with a real man. They'll never forget you. That makes you kinda immortal!	Try a little harder bud
84		dkzt13u	SquaredCircle		Fuck I forgot they announced Cass vs Big Show earlier for tonight... well at least I can go to bed early 
85	dkzf4dl	dkzoxwm	AskReddit	"By that measure then, the Persians never lost to the Greeks when they invaded Greece.  They simply didn't win.  You can very easily see from the point of view of those being invaded how it would seem like a victory.  

The US invaded a British colony, got defeated and repelled, got pushed back on all fronts, and was forced to sue for peace.  That seems like a pretty clear cut British victory to me."	The Greco-Persian wars are a lot more complex than how your presenting them, by the Greeks did actually gain from the end of the war due to the establishment of Greek colonies throughout Anatolia.
86	dgz19rq	dgz1fhq	Libertarian	owner not author.	Owning something doesn't mean you have the rights to distribute it for profit, those rights belong to the author (unless given away).  If intellectual property laws were removed, everyone would have full rights to distribute and so anyone could call themselves the author.
87	dkznv3r	dkzqow2	StardewValley	"I had the opposite experience last night. The lady with the cart had cookies. I have gestational diabetes and have to ignore all my cravings. When I saw the cookies I was like ""omg! She has cookies!"". I spam clicked to purchase all the fucking cookies and wasted a bunch of money and then realized: wait..these are not real cookies, I cannot eat them."	"Oh nooooo!! That's like dreaming it's Friday and waking up to find it's Monday! Will you be able to eat cookies when your term is up? My piano teacher had a major issue when she was expecting and for the second half of her term couldn't eat anything with fat...basically. I think she was on a straight like...lettuce diet. 

The good news is, you can do what I do, IRL...which is give the cookies away to people to make them like you. 

...wait....did you say lady? I thought that was a dudebro."

89	czj5f4f	czjbzco	Showerthoughts	Pretty sure they still have to sign whatever bill did the repealing or amending.	"The President actually does not have a role in the constitutional amendment process. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment#Federal_constitution)

As a note, amendments aren't accomplished by voting on bills, but rather by Congressional voting on an amendment proposal, and then it being handed to the states for a referendum."
90		dkzw7ak	CODZombies		I love shadows and playing public matches too. It would definitely have better games but i love watching what develops in random games. Shadows is great for this, for example (Im generalizing like a mofo rn) noobs will learn/do the civil protector over pack a punch and sometimes the shield. Camping by the box in footlights is the popular place to be. And of course due to the lack of pap for them the raygun is actually something they want. 
91	dkytbjr	dkzw3q8	OutOfTheLoop	You can get better pasta from take-out pizza joints... let alone actual restaurants.  Want inexpensive soup/salad/breadsticks -- hard to beat i guess.	Yeah, the draw for most people is the unlimited soup/salad/breadsticks thing I think.
92		dgysaml	TumblrInAction		This is so /r/thathappened that part of me wonders if I did happen
93		czjer86	Xcom		The anticipation sapping your creative juices?
94		dgyzbke	WorldofTanks		"113 does not get set on fire frontally anymore, just gets frontally ammo racked. 


I highly recommend running food, since the gun handling is already poor. Just run large repair, large med and food. 

Equipment = Vert, Rammer, Vents"
95	czj8bqr	czj8d3g	CasualConversation	I play the...piano/synth, guitar, bass, djembe, cajon, melodica, ukulele. I think my favorite is the melodica 'cause it looks so weird when I play it in public. The best use of melodica for me is in the acoustic version of [Der Kleine Vampir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p72mFG9DchI) by We Butter The Bread With Butter	Do you watch the Late Show w/ Colbert?  His band leader plays a melodica all the time.
96	dkzobgl	dkzoya3	DnD	"If your party is expecting you to soak up damage, then absolutely; however, if you have the lowest hit points in the party that's probably not necessary. If you have another idea for a feat that would let you be an effective member of the party in a supportive role, it sounds like your team will be meaty enough to allow it.
That said, if you'd like to be in the thick of combat you should take tough."	"I think i can handle the damage with the Lay on hands, plus the fact i have an adamantine plate armor that will help me in case of crits, so i probably won't fall that easy on battle.
And thanks for helping!"
97	czj6eon	czj6i19	MassEffectPhoenix	Yeah... first boyfriend, died in the Hammer invasion. 	Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
98		dgywc69	SquaredCircle		So who decides when this match ends? Was Orton being crushed by a fridge the end? 
99		dgyx814	MSLGame		Rng.  I usually get at least 1 per refill. Granted it's usually flat or rec%
100		czj4zwg	Kanye		Level 22, It suddenly got way harder on that one, I'd never heard of almost all of them
101	dgysjwg	dgyu7el	HappyWars	"Just because you challenged us months before dont mean SHIT lol.. 

first of all it usually takes awhile to really get everyone on, n as i said several times, i made SURE that PTC was going to play the devs, that was top priority..along with wanting to get neeg to play, which the hours he got on was always different...n when we did play...it was fucking random...wasnt scheduled..lol..if that had happened earlier, we would've..but around that time, was time, because we had just got done smacking the devs..

REGARDLESS..you STUPID FUCKS trying to use that as any leverage?? ""it took months""

SO FUCKING WHAT??? WTF does that have anything to do with?

so that gives u the right to play one game?? and dip, and NEVER come back to the system??

u call yourself a great player?? play ONE MAP?? if you are GREAT, you should know..a FUNDAMENTAL thing..such as different maps, is different strategies..

We all played warrior...LOL...did this kind of out of tactics..i wanted to say we beat u guys with all warriors..but the lag was more then expected...Han n Atom both using dash attack warriors??

point is, we did things i knew we shouldnt have...BUT i knew, when shit hit the fan..if we didnt win the first game..then shit was going to get changed up...dash attack warriors..vs laggers..like shaymin, n pInda..n jin...are USELESS..

i didnt care, it not like i wanted to lose the game..but i knew, that if set up correctly, we would have a better chance of winning...i wasnt going to lose the match...but i wasnt showing all the cards..im to tactical for you to get...to wise

PTC was better, YES i can say that..and more legit

Noble, including yourself WAS a bunch of cowards..and i say this, because of your own doings.. n your lack of acknowledgment of how u, and ur team approached the game..

you started playing with AKira because he was good??? LOL???

COME ONE NOW

How about Pinda???

Jin?? he was just a real good mage!!! he wasnt laggy at all!!!

LOLOLOLOL 

shaymin? one of the laggiest 1v1 warriors EVER??

supernice?? a brick wall

defending YOU...one of the laggiest players EVER..

all you laggers..surrounded yourself around other fucking laggers..

and you KNEW IT..

STOP acting like you didnt know LOL..you aint that fucking stupid...u just dont want to accept it...n mad because i brought it to the proper attention..

that is because if u or anyone gona sit there, n say Noble was the best...LOL its just laughable..when putting everything into consideration..

IM the best player ever...I KNOW legitimatizes... where YOU obviously dont

Think about all the players i mentioned in Noble..all the laggers...jin, shaymin, you, pinda, supernice, akira, oooalmightyoo (when he switched, didnt switch with us)

along with SEVERAL other laggers..that i forget their names..

and then...you add the Japs???? LOL which was basically Noble...???

everyone of those players, are laggier, then PTC's laggiest player...

PTC laggiest player, woulda been less laggy then Nobles least laggiest player...

the lag wasnt in comparison..

PTC was as legit as you're going to get on a team...aside from when you joined..lol....but u were put to use against other laggers, so it was a trade off to some degree

Im always logical, always rational, but when you miss simple shit, i become irrational with ignorance..

when you KNOW how u approached the game in comparison to me...

you KNOW the amount of lag you played with on your team

this is a good word for you...

COMFORT...you KNOW when you have that type of lag, it gives u a COMFORT..

that is why we couldnt play with Goosie any more...or at least couldnt have him push...because his lag...was to comfortable..to easy..u give me laggers like that??

just isnt fun...in a group..?? u know this comfort level im talkin about..

and u ignoring it...and not accepting it...is why i emphasize on the word coward..

ALL these things into consideration..

then..

you play us...in...One...

game.....

not a match...so dont say MATCH..remember now...its cowardess to not acknowledge simple things.. (as we just went over)

a GAME..

think of it like this...

boxers, schedule fights..months ahead of time...more then months..

it would be like fighting a third of the fight..the first 3 rounds out of 12...and be up by points...and leaving the arena...and being like

""Im the best ever"".. when he was barely winning...

where is the LOGIC in that??

it is STUPID that i have to explain this..

not acknowledging this..is ALSO cowardess..im trying to prevent u..from falling into cowardess train of thoughts..realize when you know you have done wrong, in what ever way it may be...accept it..and learn from it..

U can NOT argue..that Noble was as good...n sure as fuck not better...when u played ONE game...and Noble NEVER came back to the console...EVER AGAIN

I KNOW you got tired of me saying im the best...im the best...so u started saying Noble was the best...

but u forget..THEY ABANDONED YOU..lol...like???????


??????

n NEVER came back...supernice in that party...said something along the lines of 

""im never coming back again""

u can NOT compare yourself to someone, or a team...when you RUN SCARED...LOL...

THAT is ILLOGICAL...

there is no rebuttal here..Furthering defending what Noble did, and what Noble was...is just pathetic...not accepting fundamental shit..

N on top on it...LOL

WRITE MUSIC, IN SO MANY WORDS, CONFIRMED BASICALLY ALL OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING....

n HE was the MAIN GUY in NOBLE..LOL..


AT LEAST HE ACKNOWLEDGED...ACCEPTED....AND NOW RESPECTS

the words of WISDOM, the words of TRUTH that i speak...

i put to much time into the game..i have to good of a understanding..

that aside...what Noble did...is blatant...BITCH shit...plain n simple...

PTC was a REAL team...pretty much the only real team the game ever had..lol...

#Logic+rational=Strapz"	"Write Music was the main guy in Noble.... Far from. If anyone was the true leader of the clan it was Super Nice and me and him co lead it. 

Stop trying to suck up to him, just because he's essentially telling you what you want to hear. It's what I used to say you did with Dragz. You overate him as a player so much. It's because he was a big part (even essential) in creating the modern PTC. 

Write music simply told you that noble is filled with cowards.... so what 1 person (who btw hardly played with noble) now proved everything. Ever thought about how he clearly has a grudge with me?? It's why he said all that stuff. 

You completely overate how laggy Noble was while discrediting PTCs lag. 

You fine well know inspire, steez, Dragz, Han and keytro have been called laggers time and time again. 

You also have NO IDEA. who was in Noble. If your going to take 1 thing from this stop telling me who was in noble. Japs didn't play with NOBLE. I used to play with japs along with Dragz and supernice.... BEFORE NOBLE. 

Almighty was never in noble. 

Pinda wasn't either. 

Also you don't understand how people like Akira came into the clan. Of course he wasn't recruited. But it was when Titan split up. Players got thrown around, people's were friends etc. You couldn't split everyone up. Noble black was nobles top 8 players. That 8 has as much lag as your top8

Straps stop trying to discredit me. It's ridiculous. You fine well know what you said to me while in PTC. about how people overate my lag. Y don't you make a fuss about inspire?? He used to lag TERRIBLY and you knew it. 

You had months to fight noble. MONTHS it does not take that long to set up a match. If both parties want to play a match, regardless of time zones/jobs/school. The time can be found. I've played enough clan matches to know. 

Noble or PTC were not better than each other. 

There were weak links and carry players. 

PTC was nothing without you, me of steez. SS was right they absolutely would of beaten PTC without those 3 players. Same with Noble of it wasn't for me and Supernices defence the clan would of been nothing, obviously would of been a great clan, but the best? no. 

So forget the clans. The clans don't hold any value really. 

I didn't get tired of you saying you were the best. It was your constant discredit of Noble. Most of the stuff your saying straps isn't true. Of course noble had lag like pretty much everyone. but it was exaggerated, exactly the same with PTC. 

Noble was NOT a clan when we fought. It's the same question, why was flukes PTC when we clan matched??? because Noble wasn't a clan that's why. "
102		czjbxcm	rwbyRP		"[Tawn and Amethyst] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rwbyRP/comments/40zg75/the_great_indoors/cyyf9vl) met again after Tawn knocked a ball into the room and pegged her in the head. The two then talked about how each other had been and played but the major moment of talk when Tawn explained that he lived in a box when he was younger. After that, he noticed Amethyst's weapon and showed her he used something similar in the form of a sharpened wrench that he made for ranged capabilities. Their social short comings kept them from connecting until they played. After a short round of roughhousing that left Amethyst unable to move on the floor. The two talked about their experiences and lead Tawn to invite Amethyst to a pasta night with him and his team after giving her one of his sharpened wrenches that the girl was enamored with earlier.

*****
&gt; Ivanka Trump, the president&amp;#039;s daughter, and Jared Kushner, her husband, had pushed the president to hire Mr. Scaramucci, seeing him as a way to force out Mr. Priebus, the former national Republican committee chairman, and his allies in the West Wing.In that, Mr. Scaramucci was successful.

&gt; Mr. Scaramucci&amp;#039;s swift departure is an early indication that Mr. Kelly intends to assert his authority over the operations of the White House, and that several of the big personalities there - including Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump and Mr. Bannon - may be inclined to defer to him.

&gt; The president still values Mr. Scaramucci, according to people close to Mr. Trump and his family, and is hoping to find another, less high profile, position for him in the White House - although it is uncertain if Mr. Scaramucci would be willing to accept a demotion.

109	dgwbpwp	dgz1mbi	BingeEatingDisorder	"I don't know... I guess. Does anyone feel like
recovery is hindering your recovery? I'm sick of logging meals, sick of trying to ""eat intuitively"" and exercise intuitively. I'm sick of trying to tune in to my emotions all the fucking time and know if I'm eating for the right reason. I'm sick of eating breakfast(GROSS) and trying to drink water and having to plan out meals and snacks. I'm sick of being able to eat ""whatever I want as long as I truly want it."" I DONT KNOW WHAT I WANT I NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL.  I just want to wake up and have this all be over with.  I usually keep it positive here but I'm having a mid recovery crisis I think.

Luckily I see the dietician on Wednesday so we can drill out what's going on. It's just hard.  I'm bored of all this. I used to get to diet then binge diet then binge. It was such an exciting horrible interesting roller coaster. Now I'm just bored. And even though I know I've lost weight IT DOESNT FEEL LIKE ANY AT ALL or enough at all. I'm running out of time, I feel under the gun. I don't want to live like this."	It sounds like a dietician might be a good idea.  My therapist recommended I see one, I just sort of haven't gotten around to it.  It is boring isn't it?  Constantly monitoring, spending so much mental energy on food and eating or not.  Good luck!

Selling point are probably the non-slut, the abilities (great gambe, deathly arrow, tenfold flurry), the inclinations (challenger/utilitarian) and the equip (revenant wail, aneled bardiches (goldforged), dual barbed nails for more stagger)."	Steam ID, fam.
116	dgyjc6u	dgz101r	MensRights	"I would certainly argue that it goes both ways, with each gender having its own set of issues. Men's typically reside around legal injustice, whereas women's are largely social. 

The problem is that feminism only addresses one of these. "	"How do women have more social issues? You have body positivity (female only), anti-slut shaming so women can sleep around indiscriminately, and even female gendered insults like ""bitch"" are instantly decried as sexism by men an women alike. I think the biggest social thing you could bring up for women is that some people don't view them as ideal leaders."
117	dkzo55z	dkzqy1z	EDH	Very true.... maybe I should reconsider....	She is strong and a lot of fun, but difficult to cast and keep around without having the means to protect her. If you really want to build a mardu commander, you could wait and see what the mardu Vampires deck in C17 holds

122	dgz1vf6	dgz251y	Silverbugs	That round in the center looks pretty cool. Nice breasts of course	"I fell in love the second I saw it.   The back says 

""One troy ounce .999 fine silver struck in the United States of America by the Letcher mint certified weight and quality 1974""

Letcher?  German?   I'll look into it. 

Oh, and she does have amazing tits.  Thanks"
123	czgq497	czjbww4	ShitWehraboosSay	"To this day I still have no idea why anyone thinks that ""the soviets being worse"" absolves the nazis."	Well, I mean, even if you hate Stalin and Soviet communism, you can still make the argument that the Russians were defending their nation from an invader who wanted to enslave and slaughter them wholesale.

I think everyone in this sub who misuses [Occam's Razor](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/692/19789999.jpg) should be required to write a research paper on it. "	Thank you!  As soon as I read that phrase, it's usually all downhill rapidly.

126	czjb5gi	czjds93	SubredditSimulator	Spending money doesn't mean they have to pay off all my debt. So trust me when I am looking at costs more than you should....but you have no business using rewards cards.	This would be what you're looking for, but at that price point, that's why I have my other beater shoes. I saw them both quite a bit and find the ones that are looking similar.
127		czjge6q	Eve		People resisting change, as usual. People loved these shitty forums 10-15 years ago when they were new and they worked back then, so why change anything?
128	dgywoxp	dgyz16g	LifeProTips	"Any recommendations to getting rid of negative  influences such as toxic friends?
"	I had friends that I found toxic and I just stopped going out with them.  I kept in touch and built intentional relationships with people I enjoyed spending time around.  
129		czjbd5y	SuicideWatch		Don't. It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You can handle this, just talk to someone. I know you say you can't receive treatment, but you can. My friend recently survived a suicide attempt, and has brought himself back.

133	dkzf6o8	dkznla2	BigBrother	LOVE. IT. Season 18 Paul was so over the top and high energy that I would avoid him on the live feeds. Then him and Victor put it in first gear and really started playing the game. This season he's more grounded and thinks before he speaks... Usually. I'm all about Team Paul and Alex so if that means putting a few people on the leash, then so be it. If that means being deceptive, manipulative, and bald faced lying, I'm all for it. This is Big Brother. Not vacation bible camp. I understand Paul is not for everyone just like Cody/Jess is not for everyone. I also understand that some fans hate liars and back stabbers. That's the beauty of this game and that's why I will always be a huge fan of Big Brother.  	people don't hate Paul because he's a ruthless player, people hate Paul because he's a little bitch
134	dgumx4n	dgyu3g0	GolfClash	I didn't spam until I realized how butthurt it makes people. Once I realized some people have zero ability to concerntrate on their shot if there's a poop emoji, it was over. People spam me all the time. I still hit perfect shots. What it really is, is losers blaming other people's actions for not being able to execute a decent shot. If it's not spam you will find a new reason why you suck so hard. You know it's true so downvote away but it's not emojis, it's user error. Grow up. 	I make a point of hitting perfect if they're spamming. Then I spam the laughing emoji at them. Doesn't bother me that they're spamming other than it's poor sportsmanship (in a video game...? ugh).

136		czj7b3h	Drugs		That's a nice story. One of the saddest things about the drug culture is how people demonize all cops when in fact most, or at least many of them, are good people.

139	dkzsl93	dkzwelq	MonsterHunter	Yeah, the nectar system in 4U was overly complex, imo. I am betting that they will use the Gen/XX upgrade system since A) they kept the XX kinsect swapping, and B) the game seems to be trying to make things more user-friendly in general.	Yeah it's insane waiting till end game to get a decently fast kinsect
140		dkzud2z	USMC		well depends on what paperwork they have already signed and what oaths they may or may not have taken.
141	czj9ktt	czj9qan	StLouis	Architecture was my field of study at university, better believe I've been ogling those beauties on street view.	"If you're into fixing up, you can find deals in St. Louis like nowhere else in the United States of pre-1900 brick and pre-war architecture.  The buildings have great bones and DNA.

You can certainly find better deals elsewhere, but it would be places like Detroit or Youngstown, Ohio."

143		czjfoim	CringeAnarchy		"What the fuck is that, I guess pandering to ""feminists"" 101. Questions *for men*?They literally spend almost 3 entire minutes bitching about unfairness and shit and then simply just generalize an entire gender. 

 I love the whole ""we're woman and we're made lesser than men by society! so lets make up blatant lies and shit to try and make them feel lesser!"""
144		czj7vfc	AskReddit		"I show them my collection of anime figurines, dakimakuras, anime posters, and tell them every anime I've ever watched.

147	dkzq85s	dkzvodl	DCcomics	I'm glad he's said that he's finally going to focus on the older Titans. Still, I don't trust him developing Beast Boy as a character because he keeps on stating that Beast Boy represents comedy, and any writer who views Beast Boy as nothing but comic relief usually writes a Beast Boy that I don't want to read. That being said, he's definitely shown somewhat of an understanding of the character when he's written him as a background character, so we will see where it goes I guess.	Did he really say that Beast Boy is nothing but comic relief? I seriously doubt that and you can't deny that humor is part of his character.

149	dkzsw81	dkzvrtu	EnoughLibertarianSpam	"You're only scaling in one direction, though.

First you have to scale it on numbers: How many people are they. Then you gotta scale it on per capita: There are more people per capita in American. *Then* you have to scale for diversity: 50 Countries with four races in them (black,  asian, injun and normal). And ***then*** you have to a count for linguistic and cultural differences: How do you expect a Californian doctor to understand what his Texan patient is saying? They literally speak different languages! You'd have to train a bunch of doctors of that culture or teach them all 50 languages.

It's just impossible, you're asking too much. And we know about impossible, remember which country has been to the moon."	"It's all clear to me now. 

Thank you for your service. o7"
