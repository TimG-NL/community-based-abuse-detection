"Monsters can be whatever the DM wants them to be. Most of my beholders are LG, as are my goblins. Typically LG fey like Unicorns are bloodthirsty as hell.

1	dgyvfx6	dgyvijr	AnaheimDucks	Video review was created to keep completely blown calls from deciding a game. It's now used to decide if a player was a millimeter offside.	It's so awful in baseball. The game was already so damn slow.
2	czj2d5w	czjefb9	MLS	I think playing more international games should probably help speed his decisions up.	He looks amazing when playing in MLS, but besides a few bright moments he looks mostly average when playing in international games so far. I think he doesn't have as much confidence. I really hope he can adapt and become a key player for the US.

5	dkz4mby	dkzobbh	AskReddit	"Not political propaganda, but Rick and Morty brought back szechuan sauce.

Ever since the season premiere of Rick and Morty, people have been repeating szechuan sauce at each other like a pop-culture Freemason handshake. Lo and behold, at the start of the season proper, McDonald's creates a limited release of this obtuse dipping sauce from 1998 most people don't actually remember tasting (if it were really that popular at its release, McDonald's would have made use of it since then). 

People are high-fiving thinking ""we did it"" when McDonald's announces the sauces return (around the same time as the proper season start). This is classical cross promotion at its finest. McDonald's get a PR spike in a demographic it has been spending a lot of money, [and making stupid commercials to court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTxJZyKymA). The premier might as well have been a giant focus group to turn attention their way. If it all had backlash, then it would simply be a gag from a comedy show, but it didn't. 

Rick and Morty advertised for McDonald's, and now we're seeing a very traditional cross promotion and everybody is patting themselves on the back like they made it happen and weren't manipulated the entire way through. "	I totally agree it was an advertisement, but I'd like to counter with this: Who cares? If it was a good part of the overall show and the viewers enjoyed it... Does it really matter? Should we completely avoid using companies just to stop them from potentially advertising?

20		czjawg1	MarioMaker		There's a one-way gate in the game already, you don't have to jerry-rig one with bumpers or grinders. It sounds like what you want is enemies to fall from above in a way that Mario can't get up to where they fall from. If that's right then a one-way gate is the answer.
21	czj6cmy	czja87d	APStudents	From what I heard, Bio is considered harder than Environmental Science, that might be very ignorant, I am not sure, though I rather have Calc instead of Environmental science in Senior Year and have AP Bio as my science.	"You're not ignorant. Bio *is* harder than Envi Sci, that's a fact. Only 5% of people get a 5 on AP Bio. 

Don't waste your time taking AP Envi Sci, stay with AP Lang.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

You will come out of that class wishing you were back in it."

"	ah, really just that everyone thinks SA was so dirty and nasty because of his living conditions when really that was someone else's junk, especially the fact that the gun rack was put up above the bed by Johnson and he testified both guns there were his.  not to say that SA didn't have access to them, which he certainly did.  just that the false assumption is that all that shit in and around the trailer is his
29	dkzoc7b	dkzpnui	SeattleWA	Tfw you respect that dude's username, but not his opinions. That callous self-interest shit drives me nuts.	"I didn't mean it as strongly as it sounded, I don't believe  in eugenics, and homeopathy should be stopped.. but I have a hard time feeling  bad for someone that bought special shoes to lose weight..

It's difficult  to find the line where it's the persons fault or the salesman, it's not all black and white.. a person that buys a snake oil drug that's supposed to cure something is one thing,  because medicine  is complex and not something  a layman would understand, mix that with the desperation  of an awful disease it's understandable... so I do feel sympathy  for a person  caught in a scam like that..

But if you think a pair of shoes will help you lose weight, then you deserve to lose the 80 bucks you spent on those shoes, because it's pretty  common  knowledge that there is no magic weight loss thing..

33	czj45wy	czj8f93	Guildwars2	"yes, you can tank and/or heal in raids ! But you shouldn't need a healer in dungeons, fractals and open world content as in those game types, if everyone knows what they are doing (dodge at the right time, perform the right combos, use their self healing skills) then you don't really need a healer. But if you are running dungeons/fractals with people that are not very skilled at the game, a healer can really help to carry those people. 

So in conclusion, only raids need tanks and healers. As for the other content in the game, you shouldn't need those roles, but very low skilled players might make use of it."	To be fair, druids at high level fractals can be very nice. Not necessary, but very, very convenient.

37	dgyoq2c	dgyrwj1	pie	OP, can I get a recipe? I've tried the two in my Pie Town, NM cookbook but they both turned out too dry	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)"

get out already."
68	czj5fxa	czjeant	AskReddit	That someone would steal my pecker when I wasn't paying attention. I would have my hands down my pants all the time because I thought there was a dick thief out there. To this day when I sitting on the couch just chillin I still have my hands down my pants making sure no one can still my penis. 	I have a friend who use to tell me that. I always thought he was joking.
69	dgyz0si	dgyzwuf	Libertarian	Let me get this straight? you're saying if I write a novel and want to publish it, the publisher is under no obligation to print my name anywhere on it because my thoughts transferred to paper aren't my property? Are you high?	"If you are stupid enough to hand over the manuscript, without signing any agreements, then yes. Albeit they can be sued for fraud, if they sell it under a different name and you have proof that you wrote it.

But if you are a rational person, you will sign an agreement with them, which will specify that they must publish your book under your name and you get a certain percentage of the profits form sales. "
70	dkyru1p	dkzrvio	AustralianMakeup	[verwijderd]	I really like the Swisse Rosehip Facial Moisturizer. Even got my boyfriend on it as well.
71	dkzutl3	dkzvorr	StreetFighter	What's so funny?	"you not ""buying the argument that the quality of the show went down because of SFV"". it's clear they don't enjoy the game which lowers the quality of the episodes instantly. if they aren't having fun it isn't as fun to watch"

1. Washington, father of the country blah blah.  Also, I hear he had like 30 goddamn dicks.    
1. Adams, Alien and sedition acts, feud with Jefferson  
1. Jefferson, writer of the declaration of independence   
1. Madison, wrote the constitution    
1. Monroe, the last of the founding father presidents   
1. Adams part 2, his son.  Swore his oath on a constitutional law book instead of a bible.   
1. Jackson, trail of tears, beating people with his cane, etc.  
1. Van Buren, The Petticoat affair
1. ""Tippicanoe and Tyler too"", being William Henry Harrison who died only 30 days into his term after giving his inauguration speech in the rain and catching the flu  
1. and his vice president, Tyler, whose grandsons are still alive   

1. Polk (nobody remembers)
1. Taylor (nobody remembers, but he died in office)
1. Fillmore (nobody remembers)
1. Pierce (nobody remembers)

1. Then there's Buchanan, who was almost certainly gay  
1. Then we're into the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln  
1. Andrew Johnson was his VP and took over when he got assassinated, and was impeached but not removed from office  
1. Grant, the civil war general, famous for a horribly corrupt administration
1. Then we've got Hayes, who nobody remembers  
1. Then Garfield, notable for being ~~the first one~~ assassinated
1. His VP, Chester Arthur  
1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers
1. Benjamin Harrison, who nobody remembers
1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers
1. McKinley, the second assassinated president  
1. Teddy Fucking Roosevelt, trust buster, national parks founder, all around man's man  
1. Taft, mostly famous for being fat and becoming a supreme court justice after being president  
1. Woodrow Wilson, the last president to keep his campaign promises (at least his first term).  President during WWI, had a stroke, and his wife kind of took over.  
1. Harding, the undisputed worst president, until \*ahem\* recently  
1. Silent Cal, his vice president who took over when he died  
1. Hoover, mostly famous for not getting us out of the depression.  
1. FDR, the only president to serve more than 2 terms, New Deal, WWII, Polio, wheelchair, etc.  
1. Truman, his VP who took over and dropped the A-bombs.  
1. Eisenhower, the WWII general.  Sent in troops to desegregate schools
1. Kennedy, who slept with Marilyn Monroe and was assassinated  
1. Johnson his VP, who promptly reversed course on Vietnam  
1. Nixon who likely won because Bobby Kennedy was assassinated prior to the election, and of course he resigned in disgrace
1. Ford, who was never elected -- was appointed when Nixon's VP (Agnew) was forced out.  
1. Carter, the peanut farmer, double digit inflation and got the Iran hostages released  
1. Reagan, who took credit for getting the hostages released and played dumb when he got caught doing illegal shit.  He also liked jellybeans  
1. Bush, who famously said no new taxes and then made new taxes  
1. Clinton, who banged an intern and got impeached for lying about it, and set up the conditions for a future economic meltdown  
1. Bush Jr, who created enormous deficits then blamed democrats for deficit spending, also 9/11 and mission accomplished and almost choking to death on a pretzel.
1. Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for not being Bush Jr.  

After that, I forget."	I love your little summaries for each one.

[This is what most of the notes in game look like.](http://loadscreen.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fallout4-2015-11-16-21-09-15-138.png) There's not really a lot of official documents but these notes are common and they mostly look the same, so I suppose he will recognize the style. You could make your note look something like that, and add a Brotherhood of Steel symbol somewhere to make it look more official.

92	dgy6thh	dgytddk	Chinavisa	That's ok, I looked into this and their German passports should work for 144 and 72.	Great.  One other thing to worry about with a TWOV is convincing the cruise line to let you board.  Airlines have deferred keeping track of all the visa rules to [Timatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timatic).  However cruise lines in the past have generally required you to have a visa for all the countries at which your cruise will visit.  This has caused some friction between passengers who don't want to pay for a Chinese visa when a transit should work and the cruise lines who want to keep it simple and require passengers to have a visa.  So you should check with the cruise line to make sure they can board without a visa.  Both at boarding in Osaka and at immigration in Shanghai they will need to show proof of booked tickets onward to a third country within 144 hours.

94		dkztcs1	ForeverAlone		I often wonder what women in other states look like. My town is one of the fattest in Texas, so going outside, it's mostly just women with those weird over-hanging beer guts to obese women. When I was spending all week in New Mexico, especially in Roswell, there was a lot of pretty Hispanic girls. I imagine other states only get better.
95		dgz13qi	AskReddit		All I know is that I think a lot about Justin Trudeau... 
96		dgyu1ay	MakeupAddiction		I'm very fair with neutral undertones but prefer foundations that are a little yellow over my redness plus I have dry skin so drugstore foundation is pretty much a no go for me too. I do think it's worth it to splurge on a foundation that works for you!  Plus you could waste a lot of money buying foundations that don't work for you so sometimes it's just worth it to buy something you can sample beforehand.

There are four types of people you encounter.  

1. People who like you for the wrong reasons.

2. People who like you for the right reasons.

3. People who dislike you for the wrong reasons.

4. People who dislike you for the right reasons.

Group 4 is the only one you should be concerned about.

I'm cheating, because this is advice I have given to my kids, but middle schoolers are obsesses with all four groups.  Hopefully it'll sink in over time."	"It's perfectly fine for people to have right reasons to dislike you. I'd generalize and say a world where everybody is acting  because of right reasons is a damn fine place. Being concerned about whether people like you is a waste of time. 

People liking you for the wrong reasons are what I would be most concerned about because you never know when they'll realize they're wrong and dislike you. This unpredictable loss of support could be costly in the wrong circumstances. "

For context I have 2 boys aged 6 and 7. When they mess up my first course of action is to make them feel like I understand them. I don't believe they will listen to me as well if I don't do this. I say things like ""it makes sense that you are angry at your brother, cause he hurt you, but that doesn't make it OK that you threw a rock at him"" then I talk about using words and other ways to deal with anger without lashing out. I also talk a lot about "" how would you feel if your brother did that to you "" kind of thing in an attempt to cultivate some empathy.

I know the listen to me based on how they change and grow. I try not to lecture too much or punish too much because they are kids and they are just learning these lessons. But they probably will end up avoiding trouble just so I don't bore them to death with another bs dad lecture. But hopefully my understanding and compassion is an example for them to follow. Because as well as punishing them I am also teaching then how to deal with conflict resolution, so I want to set a positive example."

129	dkzoey9	dkzqhw6	BitcoinMarkets	Agree.  I first noticed the slide when he mocked anyone who said the halving was priced in (which it was).	"*(Record scratches)*

Say what? I definitely didn't like the mockery, but I also don't think the halving was priced in. I think knowledge of the halving was priced in, ie. it wasn't a surprise to anyone that a halving would occur. But the actual process of pricing in the halving was a gradual one, for two reasons: a) it wouldn't be fully priced in until post-halving, when the threat of negative halving effects would dissipate (e.g. miners dropping off en masse), and b) the post-halving supply shock (of sorts) takes months to price in in and of itself."

132	dkzt53y	dkzvung	BigBrother	"Helps: Jessica, Elena, Kevin

Jessica is getting a lot out of this. Anyone in the house who was on the fence between Jody and Fucktwat United will definitely lean towards Jody after Thursday. They saw how immature, conniving, and idiotic Fucktwat United is, and will want Paul out as soon as possible. Elena will be helped by this as she was a fly on the wall, along with Kevin. They have no true ties with anyone, and nothing will be associated with them.

Neutral: Matt, Cody, Jason, Mark

Cody is in the same position as before. Mark is still safe, and isn't as much of a target, but still is enough of a target that it didn't help him. Jason and Matt are on the majority side right now, but once Fucktwat United falls, they'll be associated with them and will have a hard time assimilating. However, they still are in the majority so they aren't hurt right now.

Hurts: Raven, Paul, Josh, Christmas, Alex

Where to fucking start. Well for starters, Alex made a complete ass out of herself, proved that she isn't trustworthy, and lost all respect from live feeders so she will probably be in hit water after the season. Josh is still an idiot, and made himself target dos after numero uno (Paul) is gone. Christmas has no real ties apart from Josh, who is useless, so anyone present in the room when she was being a raging bitch about Cody's military background will relay it to Jody with no moral qualms. Raven completely shed her image as the poor little dying girl, and is now the immature brat. Also, she still currently exists as Raven Walton, so that fucking sucks for her.

And Paul. Sweet, lovable Paul.

Someone better upload this to Pornhub, because he just got completely fucked. There is literally no way to express how fucked he got."	your Hurts section was a work of art. can you make a bb podcast?
133	dkzrgk5	dkzv9yq	Guildwars2	I Think they will Introduce new 3 stat gear with 2 major stats and 1 minor stat.

135	dkzqf5v	dkztb5v	IDontWorkHereLady	"I can see how that would be upsetting to see first hand the mistreatment of animals that are under human care and unable to defend themselves or get their own food. This is interesting because this is exactly where the ""angry vegan"" stereotype comes from. Try reading my first sentence again but thinking about factory farm animals. 
Honestly watch someone like Ask Yourself on YouTube who isn't afraid to show factory farm footage while he's making logical arguments or watch Gary Yourofsky's speech
[speech](www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4) 

I can promise you a better understanding of vegan perspective and there's a 90% chance you'll turn overnight.  "	"Please do not assume I am ignorant of the treatment of animals in factory farms. And please notice I said nothing against *humans* eating a vegan or vegetarian diet, only against feeding carnivorous animals a vegan diet.

In fact my only comment on human diets was that not eating at least some vegetables is unnatural for humans. And I was originally replying to your statement of
&gt;I know of people with cats and dogs who feed their pets vegan pet food. It's not too extreme when you think about it. Yes the animals naturally eat meat but when you buy pet food that isn't meat is it?

Edited to add, that trying to paint  the situation as a choice between factory farmed meat or a vegan diet, is as invalid an argument as using crappy  bargain brand pet food to justify feeding obligate carnivores vegan diets, or  someone using vegan junkfood to justify not eating vegetables. 

Picking the worst possible example of something you disagree with, and comparing to a really good example of something you agree with just makes it look like your position can't stand on it's own, and like you  think the people you are trying to convince are too stupid to see through the way you warped the facts.

If it had just been a sneaky infiltration the Imperials probably wouldn't have mobilized everything. The might not even believe rebels were in the base. But when the whole damn fleet shows up... yeah... better lock down the facility, don't let anybody escape. If you notice the don't close the shield until *after* the fleet shows up. The fleet totally fucked up the extraction.

146	czjfmbt	czjfp8a	Bad_Cop_No_Donut	"You're absolutely right.  The concentration of wealth is a real problem, around the world but especially in the U.S.  The relative impact of the top 1% but especially of the 0.1% is unacceptable.

Nevertheless, *you personally* aren't really contributing to the conversation by lobbying out little ankle-biter comments like ""Who said the US is a highly developed, first world country?""  That's why you're being downvoted all over: for being oblique, for stating falsehoods, and for unnecessary condescending hostility.

Having a political point of view doesn't mean that you can deny reality.  Having any point of view is pointless when you do not actually communicate it, as you did not do here until your second comment.  I honestly had no idea you were on about the wealth distribution.  For all I knew, you were upset about the lack of single-payer.  And finally, if you want to avoid downvotes, stop referring to your fellow redditors as ""sheep.""  From the evidence of your comments, you don't have a deep knowledge of anything, so please do not condescend to others that you do not know."	"Which falsehoods did I state?

I was downvoted way before I called people sheep.

You don't seem to have any deep knowledge about anything because you can still call the USA a first world country with knowledge that 99% of the population doesn't own any significant portion of the wealth."

I assume eventually they will fossilize under the pressure of so many pillows and become bedrock.
