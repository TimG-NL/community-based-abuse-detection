47	czgtqcs	czjdqfx	DaystromInstitute	People are not answering the question I posed. I will clarify. When Sisko retook DS9, Dukat was in Federation custody now had the war ended at that point or shortly there after would the other parties convene a trial for Dukat using him as a bargaining chip to force the Dominion to surrender.  Sisko, Martok and Senator Velal could force concessions onto the Dominion by holding a public trial of Cardassia's former leader. My question is not about the outcome of the war rather it is about the methods open to the Alliance in prosecuting the war.      	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sh#t about the Cardassians time and time again.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."

55	czjfzqy	czjg8r4	DenverBroncos	"Well that's my point. Nothing is free, but that's how it is percieved. If people would do a little research they would see that the upper end is paying a large portion (43.4% tax basis with Obamacare tax included if I remember correctly, it's late and I'll have to double check now) on top of that only the upper 2 divisions of the tax bracket are paying the Obamacare tax. That's ridiculous. Think about how skewed that is. 

Then you have Sanders saying he wants to give everyone a free college education. No. No no no no NO. It doesn't work that way. By going to college you are making a choice that you want to have an advantage over others your same age in the job force. You think you should get that without paying? Bullshit. Don't tell me you can't go to school and work either. I know plenty that do, maybe you can't go to a major school, but you can start at a community college and work your way up as your resources accumulate if you work at it. That one really pisses me off.

And yes weed is a vice. I don't mind people smoking, and I think it has a ton of medicinal value, but it creates massive issues for employers, especially those with vehicles on the road, or in dangerous situations. The set up for it was poorly executed and years later they still don't know how to handle it. On top of that Colorado is the number 1 exporter of illegal pot to other states now in the nation... that's a great rap to have. The tax is a joke.

Trump... he says some thing that I think are interpreted in a way he doesn't intend ag times due to not being a politician, and going mostly off the top of his head. I still worry he could just be a ploy at this point. Also, if he were elected he would need one hell of a VP, one that could pull him back at times. But if he is speaking the truth, yes, he wants to tear a lot of the bureaucracy out of the system. Also, the United States is simply the largest business in the world, he runs an extremely successful business by surrounding himself with people that know their jobs and he trusts, and listens to them. He doesn't have to know every facet of his business, he just has to get the right people for the job, which is what the president has to do with his cabinet.

So I can make a decent argument for him, but I still don't trust him completely at this time, and I want to see more debates that aren't just staged to attack each other. As an aside, people rip on him about his comment of a ""small million dollar loan"", well the fact of the matter is that ***IS*** small for a business to get any type of start, and to grow at any type of speed. Just think of manufacturing, that's nothing. He also turned a million into a billion... that's the equivalence of you or I turning a hundred dollar bill into 100,000 dollars... 1000x growth. That's one statement that shouldn't be ragged on. But he does say some stupid shit... 

So yea... that was longer than intended, but I felt you deserved a full answer, since you actually seemed interested in thoughtful discussion. "	"Glad to see that opinion.  

I mostly agree.  

Also, obviously, Trump IS a bit over the top in his actions, but what better choice is there?  

Hilary, with her lies and political dicksuckery?  

Jeb, with his turtles and guac?  

Bernie, with his unrealistic pipe dream liberal-land promises?  

Who else is a realistic candicate?  

This is why I say that Trump seems to be the top candidate.  

I like how you said that 'people couldn't handle weed'.  I agree wholeheartedly.  The government has a responsability to sway people to do certain things, as to not harm themselves or everyone else, or cause harm by inaction.  

I feel like a president is someone that knows many people, knows how the world works, and knows what is best for the people, kind of like a good, stern parent.  

Hilary seems to be an absentminded soccer mom sipping on her frappe, Jeb seems like an autistic kid obcessed with turtles and guac, and Bernie seems to be a pothead that thinks 'love is all you need man', thinking that people have the ability to have self-control and provide their justified part in the system as a whole.  

Trump knows what's best for the nation, at least on the economics side of it, which is likely the single largest point of focus for the US, moving through the years when the EU dissolves, China falls, and mass refugee problems are abundant.

78		dgyz6rl	Fieldhockey		"I personally have played in a mixed off-season comp the past couple of years and I love it. The main reason for it is my partner and I play for separate clubs and off-season is the only opportunity we have to play in the same team.

I have been fortunate though to play in a very good off-season comp. All teams consist of players in the highest tier of grades so the games are just as hard, if not harder, than winter season.

The other benefit of playing off-season is it helps to maintain game fitness.  May not be the same as your off-season comp but I would recommend giving it a shot!

As for stick skills, I know plenty of players who will focus on tapping the ball at the end of their stick and practice dribbling skills in the backyard. Hard to do much if you don't have much room but these basics will help with hand-eye coordination and to speed up basic skills."

117		dgyzwd6	Undertale		DETERMINATION is a substance, something that everyone has in their souls, but monsters have it in smaller amounts than humans. However, they have enough where they can say, passionately pursue desires- like Papyrus wanting to join the Royal Guard. For JUSTICE, BRAVERY, PERSEVERANCE, KINDESS, INTEGRITY, and PATIENCE, I feel like they're more like traits than substances, or else Alphys probably would have managed to get those from the souls as well while she was experimenting. With these traits, probably nothing physical would happen to a monster with excessive amounts. They'd simply become extreme representations of those traits. This is why you don't see Toriel melting or disintegrating or whatever from her kindness, or Undyne from her strong need for justice.

128		dkzslau	BleachBraveSouls		"Have my upvote- I agree - I think you have inspired me to rant... I have been playing 550 days on the same account - so I remember things that in retrospect I feel were actually bad-  and KLab listened. 

As I've said before I think this is the only gacha game many people on this sub play. They do not understand just how crappy most of the others are. KLab does not have an obligation to give us better rates or even free stuff for that matter- but they choose to give us a ton of free stuff. At this point I don't care that is wasn't as good as last year- we got something- and it wasn't even that bad.

I spent an entire year without a single chappy or other good 5 star accessory to my name- i got beat down like no other in 4th seat repeatedly-I like you just got blue Kenny today and I might finally have a viable chance at 3rd seat. But I have never been mad about my ""misfortune"" I just worked with what I had, managed my orbs wisely (since I don't use money outside of the few steals we had for 4.99) , and most importantly had fun with the game. 

I guess I would just say to those that are really unhappy - the game is great and nothing in life is perfect- if you aren't having fun or are extremely unhappy with a game/developer take a break and maybe you will enjoy the game again on your return! 

And now for the inevitable downvotes :("

132		czj7nw7	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon		"I'm a 'ghost hunter' so I was actively looking for evidence while staying reasonable, and not jumping to assumptions.  

We went to this old plantation that has a church on the grounds.  We go their a couple times a year because it's old and creepy, and people have experiences there.  Personally I don't tend to believe any one else's experience except my own, and my fiancÃ© because I feel we are the most level headed people in the group.  Mine may not be the most exciting experience, but its one of the very few that I have experienced that I 100% believe was paranormal.  

 I was in the church that was supposed to be haunted, and after sitting there quietly we (a group of about 4) began to hear what sounded like footsteps. At first I just rationalized it as the church settling or whatnot but it really did sound like heavy footsteps, even with a sort of heel-to-toe sound. So I sat in the middle of the aisle where I had been hearing them and you could hear the footsteps walk away from me and towards me. I did scream once because the footstep were so loud (almost stomping) and it was RIGHT beside me. I even felt the floor beneath me vibrate a little.
