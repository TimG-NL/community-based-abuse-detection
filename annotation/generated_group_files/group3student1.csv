Natural born citizens also have some crazy ideas on occasion but just because someone wants to kill a black man for marrying a white woman, doesn't mean the law is going to change to allow that. But I don't know just believe what you want and keep voting in line with it. I'm tired.	"This is a Democracy, it only takes %3 to sway an election, we are at %1 now.

But it is far more than that.  Look what happened in Turkey.  Islamists used to be %10 of the population 70 years ago (about the same as France today), now Ergodan, who was voted in Democratically, is firing and imprisoning secular judges and military officials and changing the constitution to make Turkey an Islamic nation.

The Muslim brotherhood itself has a very clear agenda to implement the same thing in the west, and many Imams talk openly about it,including ""outbreeding the infidels"".  

The same thing that happened in Turkey will happen in Europe, and then the gays will be executed legally, as is currently done in the Middle East.."

I agree with everything you said. Imo the ADO events cater towards the recreational dart player and it just so happens some of them are REALLY good at playing darts for American players. 

There might be a few examples that count as ""professional"" but it's fairly rare. I won't name any names but there was a VERY well known US player that won 3 Dartslive events several years ago to the tune of 12 grand each. Plus he had a contract with a Japanese company that was quite lucrative. But that's just a one off example. "	"I started the thread as it was my first tournament setting of any kind. I don't disagree with you at all. We had the same discussion while we were there. It was cool to see the US World Cup Duo (Butler and Young) play since I just watched them a few months ago.

44	czjf6t5	czjf9u6	DestinyTheGame	"My wish list for the Crucible:

• Double the spawn time of special and heavy. 
• Add just a little more flinch to snipers.
• Reduce aim assist on all snipers.
• Bring Thorn's damage in-line with legendary weapons. The DoT should be what makes it exotic, but it shouldn't do so much extra damage. 
• Bring TLW's damage more in-line with legendary weapons. This thing is way too strong. 4 body shots for a kill, and 2 to the head (hipfire). This thing shoots faster than MIDA and doesn't even require headshots for a fast time to kill. Reduce the extra damage. 
• Since TLW gets bonus damage while hipfiring, shouldn't First Curse at least get some sort of bonus damage while First Curse perk is active? Why can TLW kill someone with max armor in 2 shots, but First Curse can't? (Assuming TLW doesn't get nerfed.)
• High impact auto rifles need crit damage increased. Higher impact autos should have the farthest range as well. 
• Focus Fire perk on high impact autos should make crits at a minimum of 39, and not the current (33).
• High impact pulse rifles should be restored to their former damage. 
• Fusion rifles should be effective outside of shotgun range. I'd say about double the range is good. Tightening stability goes hand to hand with effective range. 

I know it's a pretty ridiculous list, but I think I'd actually be able to enjoy the Crucible if these changes were implemented. We *need* variety. I'm just tired of being killed by the same six weapons every game. TLW, Thorn, MIDA, 1000-Yard, Party Crasher, and Harrowed Quillim's Terminus.

Edit: Of course I get downvoted because nobody agrees with a TLW rebalance. I've been on the receiving end of that weapon for a year now and I can say that I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was already perfectly balanced. "	"I think these are all good except the TLW nerf. It's a shell of its former self, and it just straight up dies outside of, like, twenty feet. I never feel like I've been unfairly killed by it any more. If I get melted, I had it coming.

If it gets nerfed again, it becomes unusable, and I don't think that's necessary."

After you transcend, hit 1 quick ascension and go for the ancients you want, if you don't get any of them hit another quick ascension hoping that you can get the ancients you want. Then collect the relic quest reward and equip the helpful ones if there are any, then use your Ancient Souls, don't forget to use them!

First would be manners, those raised in middle class families usually have a much greater understanding of propper manners, how to dress, how to act, when not to use vulgar language, appropriate things to talk about, etc.

A huge one, though, would be *frugality*, which I think is an entirely middle class ideal.  All to often those from lower class homes, even when making decent money, would be ""rich on Friday, broke on Monday."". The idea of being frugal and saving money is not common.  Usually those, in my personal experience, from the bottom of the spectrum where those most likely to buy expensive electronics, clothes, cars and such rather than saving.  Another example is that in my early twenties, I knew two types of people who would go blow $300+ at a nightclub:  rich kids from wealthy families, and poor guys from poor families without education.

An intangible difference is a feeling of dissatisfaction.  As I was working and poor, I knew I was poor, and I knew I had to do something about it.  I had an idea of how it should be.  I could not imagine trying to have children or other things while in that situation that would hinder me improving.  For those who have never seen better, the first time they had any amount of income above living hand-to-mouth, they considered themselves well off.

I know this sounds kind of arrogant, it is not my intent to blame people for being poor, but these differences are apparent, and it is likely because those raised in the lowest social and economic classes do not have a concept of how others act.

Also, I believe in general, most all of the poor people on reddit are more similar to myself, even if they have poverty or working class level income, they likely have a middle class background and a good portion are educated, though perhaps with useless degree and a heap of debt.  Socially, though, this site is in vast majority middle class."	"&gt; All to often those from lower class homes, even when making decent money, would be ""rich on Friday, broke on Monday.

91	czjeeif	czjf1am	IAmA	What a shitty favourite active player to like. He's a great shot but terrible defender and overall lazy skater. 	I think my fandom was cemented through the constant vitriol thrown his way. He was the only player worth watching on the Leafs for the last fews years and just for that I'll always support him. Besides, I find it so amusing seeing some seemingly fat dude who is so lethargic just bomb down the wing like he does.

98		dkzsejc	AskMen		MFF is a real fantasy. Current girl I’m talking to says she might be ok for my birthday but only if I strictly have sex with her and only oral with the other. I’m fine with it since I don’t think I can last long enough to do both. 
99	czj4zjr	czj9x2q	AskReddit	I do all the cooking. I'm just better at it than my wife and she knows this.	My mother is a master in the kitchen.  She has 2 sons, no daughters.  There is no way we are going to let those recipes and tradition end on account of us being too manly to cook a meal.

>We don't need the biggest Wrestlemania of all-time to go off the air with Reigns and The Rock celebrating while Triple H and Vince lay there in defeat.

If you're expecting anything ***other*** than this to happen at Mania, then you're just setting yourself up for disappointment."	This is the very reason I lost interest in Mania this year. Between Triple H as Champion &amp; Roman as impending 3 time Champ, I just don't want to watch it. Has any top guy ever had such short title reigns their 1st 2 times with the belt?

His best bet is to greyshirt for 5 months, become full scholarship in January, and have his redshirt still intact.  Then he doesn't waste the redshirt season by simply lining up on scout team every day."	Obviously Nick Saban thought he did back in June.

114		czjcw8s	AskReddit		"Here's mine:
This was over four years ago and still haunts me.

I was at the eighth grade dance. I didn't have very many friends in middle school, so I was just kind of dancing by myself in the center of the mash. I hear from behind me a loud ""Yeah, Adam!"" and I turn around to see its the girl I had had a crush on for basically the entire year. Before this moment, I don't think I'd even had a conversation with her. We make eye contact, and she turns around, pointing her butt in my direction, an obvious invitation to grind (yes, it was one of those dances, the whole thing was a disgusting mess. Of course, I didn't think so at the time). Now, I had been a fairly sheltered kid. I had no idea why she was doing that or what I was supposed to do. She dancing a little, going up and down, looking back waiting for me to do something. 
Then it dawned on me, I knew exactly what to do. 

I turned my back to her, backed up into her, and we rubbed backs for a solid ten seconds. She turned around with the most wtf look on her face and disappeared into the mob of people. 
We never spoke or saw each other again, and I'm glad we haven't."
115		dgz1lby	BetterEveryLoop		My highschool has this arrangement. All of gr 9 I walked into the pole cause i wanted to be the cool kid that opener both doors. Was not cool with all the bruises on my face.

Well, I'm sorry my opinion gives you a false perception about me - I suppose what I find annoying is different than what you find annoying. "	"I was only trying to help. I fear you've posted a question without preparing yourself for an honest answer and criticism. 

Seat belts can be ""annoying"" when I'm trying untangle myself to reach something in the back seat, but I don't not wear it or complain about something that will literally save my life if the worst case scenario happens."
118	dgyt0e1	dgyyg8z	AskReddit	"I received a letter after donating blood years ago with a big PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL and IMPORTANT on it. Letter states I had a false positive on the necessary HIV screening. It had huge markers insisting I did not have HIV but they were required to notify me. 

Apparently certain auto-immune diseases (which I have) can cause the pre-screen to test false positive but after all additional testing, they confirmed it was negative. Considering I had no risk factors besides medical procedures, it was a huge heart attack day for me. Took a while for me to calm down and a few more blood tests. "	"That sort of thing sort of says ""FUCKING OPEN IT"" to most people who aren't the intended recipient. "
119	dgyuwk4	dgyz4u4	MMA	Not sure why it's called an oblique. Maybe that's where the kick is usually thrown in that that boxing. I do know that it differs from a side kick in that the toes face to the outside of the kicker instead of towards the inside.	"&gt;Not sure why it's called an oblique.

Same here, oblique sort of means ""at a slanted angle"" and I think oblique kicks are unique because you connect while the knee is still bent."

136	czj22wl	czj7tcw	Python	"The hashes do not come from the server.

PyPI displays (unsafe, unreliable MD5) hashes of packages, but that is not used in any way by this feature of pip. What's going on here is that you, the end user of pip, will manually obtain a known-good copy of the package you want, compute the SHA-256 (or other stronger hash of your choice, so long as `hashlib` supports it) hash of it, and put that hash in your requirements file. Then pip can -- locally, on the machine pip is running on -- compute the hash of the package it downloads, and compare to what you provided. If it matches the hash of the known-good package, installation succeeds. If it doesn't match, installation is aborted.

So while it's not full-on package signing (which would be nice but requires a whole different kind of infrastructure), it does give you the tools to avoid ""malicious index server giving me a bad package"" problems, so long as you're using it responsibly.

(also worth noting that PyPI does actually support signed uploads -- I do this with all my personal packages, and Django has been doing it for years -- but the end-user package-installation toolchain doesn't have the infrastructure to do full web-of-trust verification of those, hence my parenthetical in the above paragraph; if you're interested, click [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.9.1) for example and scroll down to the file list; you'll see both the display-only MD5 hashes of the files, and links labeled 'pgp' which are the signatures for those files)"	"&gt; PyPI displays (unsafe, unreliable MD5) hashes of packages, but that is not used in any way by this feature of pip. 

*Not by this feature, but pip does check that the hash given in a fragment of the package download url (which will be the same as that displayed on the page) matches that which it calculates on the package downloaded. This is purely file-integrity checking."
137		dkzqeyo	AskReddit		"We adopted a cat a few months ago, so we're still getting to know him. He's about 18 months old, give or take. When we brought him home, he seemed like a regular cat, but we quickly realized that he's super smart. 

He can open our shutters; he works a paw between two of the louvers and pushes them up or down until the whole shutter is open, so he can watch the birds in the backyard. 

We've got a wall niche where he loves to hang out, so he's up off the floor. There are light switches on one side, and after seeing someone turn on a light ONCE, he pawed at the switches. Of course he got a reaction from us, so now he regularly plays with the switches to make us laugh. 

Any door or drawer that is even half a centimeter open is likely to end up being opened and investigated. He's ended up in some pretty interesting hideouts. 

He's amazing at playing fetch -- his favourite toys are pompoms from the dollar store, but he'll retrieve just about anything if he's in the mood. 

He knows what birds are -- if you say there are birds in the backyard, he'll go to the window to watch (his favourite thing). Better yet, if I grab my laptop and ask him 'want to watch birds?' he will start meowing, then run over to curl up in my lap and watch a youtube channel I found that shows birds and squirrels at a feeder (it's actually designed for cats to watch when owners aren't home). 

When we realized how bright he was, I decided to deliberately train him to do some things, to keep his mind busy so he wouldn't be bored and wreck the house. Within two weeks he had learned to 'come', 'sit', 'beg', 'shake a paw', and 'gimme five' -- he's a cat, so he'll only work for treats and only if he's in the mood, but it's still astonishing to me that he's so incredibly trainable. 

Edit -- I forgot his best 'trick'; he saw one of us turn on one of the roombas, and because he LOVES to chase them around he figured out that he could push the button on top twice in a row and make the vacuum start up any time he chose. Now every once in a while we'll hear him take off downstairs and pounce on the vacuum so he can stalk it. People tend not to believe us until they see him do it, but he seems to like to show off this particular trick for guests. Several times now we've been visiting with someone in the living room and the cat will just appear... meow... swat the vacuum... then deliberately paw the button. My mother-in-law went nuts, she just couldn't believe it -- 'that wasn't an accident, he had to push the button two times! Oh my god! You need to get that on video!' We're definitely going to try, but it's tough since most of the time he does it at 1am when we're asleep! :D  "
