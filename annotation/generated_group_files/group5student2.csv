0		czjayls	Frugal		"please do supplement your food by taking advantage of community meals! generally food stamps cover fresh stuff (fruit, produce, meat/fish) and stuff that you need to expend effort to prepare (frozen fried chicken, yes; fried chicken from the deli counter that is cheaper, no)

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

edit: wanted to add that if you can arrange with someone to get mail at their place, do it. It's really hard to get a new job (or other benefits) with no address."

9	czj8br0	czj9vsu	Vive	I don't think Oculus will release the pricing for the Touch anytime soon. They learned their lesson about not releasing pricing early, as they got a ton of backlash for the $600 Rift. I also hear they're having a lot of problems getting the Touch technology to work because of connectivity issues and extremely low battery life which may pose an issue even a year from now and may affect the pricing, which is another reason they probably won't disclose the price ahead of time. But I am pretty sure it won't be less than $200 because it includes a whole other camera (which I hear they're also having issues with) and two controllers. I'd imagine it might even cost up to $300. Vive is seriously your best bet.	Don't get me wrong I want a Vive it just depends on how much it costs up front. I don't see the camera being that much on the touch, it's a camera ya know? They are pretty cheap these days. I hadn't heard about the tracking issues but if so that's a definite issue that would change my opinion. I'm just afraid Vive is going to come out over $1k and if that's the case I'll definitely go rift.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.  

It's also not saying good or bad.  It's just saying, I don't think 5% guaranteed annual rate of return."
36		dkzs1df	FORTnITE		I played on PC since the Alpha and it acts as my main account but I also have friends on xbox to play with so I purchased it again. Similar thing happened, I played for a few days and finally got an error message when logging in via Xbox and when I went back to PC it wouldn't let me in either. The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days. The whole making you go through the tutorial again I didn't have to deal with so that sounds scary.... I don't know if my fix will help with you... but if it does, yay?

38		dkztdu2	Entrepreneur		"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."

56	dgyh84g	dgyx9zn	BlueJackets	"When you need an anchor on your blue line to eat tough minutes against the opponents top skaters, Jack Johnson is... not it.

But playing middle tier minutes with a great skater like Savard alongside him, he's looked better. As has been said, he is almost certain to be our expansion draft loss, and that is just fine. He will do good there, could be their captain and possible face of their franchise at the start. Good for him.

As for us, we have Nutivaara and Carlsson who can play the minutes, and Ryan Murray is simply a lot better than Johnson with the puck. He makes better passes and reads the play better (although admittedly not as durable). Subtracting Johnson and adding Carlsson makes us better defensively. Plus if Johnson is picked, it means Anderson (who will likely replace Dubinsky in a few years) and Karlsson won't be. 

I'll thank Jack for his service. I won't pretend I always liked his game but I will sincerely appreciate the effort he gave this team and city. "	"I wholeheartedly disagree with so many things in this comment. First, if you offered Ryan Murray a million dollars to do this with a puck he couldn't: https://twitter.com/NHL/status/848695374076420096/video/1 . The only thing Murray is better at is stretch passing and stick checking. His positioning needs a ton of work. His speed is light years behind Johnson especially since the knee injury.

Second Nuti and Carlsson at this point in their careers could never skate the minutes and responsibilities JMFJ does. Do you wanna see Nuti on the PK? I don't. Maybe you didn't notice that sometimes Nuti played 10 minutes a game because he was flat out not being defensively responsible. I like the guy as a future play maker but come on. Carlsson is good and promising but far from a sure enough thing to bail on what was an elite shut down pairing this season. Defensemen aren't nearly as plug and play as offensive guys.

Third Josh Anderson is a winger, so he can't replace Dubinsky ever. I love Wild Bill but he, and even Andy are 10x more replaceable than Johnson. Perhaps you haven't heard about this Dubois guy we have, or Kolesar, Abramov, Milano, Stenlund, "

The game will include the option for private servers, like Freelancer, and will offer plenty of opportunities for players who are interested in modding the content. Unlike many games, none of these aspects is an afterthought: they all combine to form the core of the Star Citizen experience.

""Oh, you wanted to Skype your family? Let's just slow that data to a crawl so it basically looks like you're tunneling through 1995. But if you upgrade to our *premium* plan, which includes Turbo Skype, only from Verizon, you'll enjoy crystal clear quality for only $19.99 more a month!"" Basically, without net neutrality, your ISP would receive legal permission to digitally torture you for money.

The better solution would be to have robust competition, so if your ISP ever tried this, you could switch to one of the many others. Then we probably wouldn't need net neutrality rules. But right now, many people only have a couple ISPs they can use, so that's not much help.

Net neutrality is not a philosophically ""correct"" thing to do, because it represents a lot of intrusive regulation in the tech sector where that's not desirable, but in the situation where we find ourselves, it's better than the alternative, which is frankly horrifying."

80	dkzrpsf	dkzs870	TalesFromYourServer	"* It's the thought that because we can't hear (an organic/physical disability) we must be fixed (i.e. CI or Hearing Aids) sometimes against our will (with the Cochlear Implant, alot of times Deaf children aren't given a choice and it's irreversible! You can't get rid of a CI!)

I don't agree with the thought of *fixing*. It's a way of improving your life. You may not think that and that's fine.

By giving the children a choice do you mean having a final say on it?

* Point two
Actually we get that alot ""oh you can't drive! You're deaf!"" ""Oh, sorry you can't be a server, you're deaf."" Etc. Usually (at least for me) causes a ""I'm-gonna-fucking-prove-you-wrong"" attitude.

You're talking as ""we"". If that happened to you, I'm sorry. Dumb people say dumb things.

If that causes you that attitude, GOOD. But don't do it because of them. Do it for you. Prove it to yourself because at the same time you're showing them that you are capable and this disability does not define you.

* Because of the school I went to and parents and employers etc. It was basically the only way my high school would let me finish my junior and senior years and my parents wouldn't let me go to a Deaf school or learn sign language. 

Can you explain this better, please?


*I chose not to wear them because they didn't help (I've tried them recently and they don't help at all anymore) as much as people thought and I got tired of sort of distinguishing noises, it made me concentrate too much and I'd always end my days with a massive headache. That and they aren't cute, but that's the last and least important of my reasons.

how did they not help? are they're the ones behind the ear or the smaller ones that goes inside?"	"I mean just let children be part of the discussion, it's irreversible and ultimately their body, their life. I sure as he'll also disagree with sheltering deaf kids in a Deaf bubble (but that may be my mainstream upbringing speaking) 

School I went to was a private school and they were very much anti-signing (so we're my parents) my parents refused to let me learn sign language because they said me being deaf was God's way of punishing me for being gay. And alot of employers are surprisingly not that educated on Deaf people, which is reasonable if they don't see Deaf people all that often.

Yeah hearing aids basically helped me sort of hear sounds but for them to be even remotely intelligible I had to basically put all my concentration and effort into it and so it was more a hinderence then a gift."
81	czja5g0	czjfhez	DestinyTheGame	"That is certainly a possibility. But as others have pointed out it is typical that a CEO resigning on their own volition will make a statement themselves, and in this situation it was the new CEO who made the statement (typical of a firing). That is where the speculation is coming from. 

Again nobody knows what actually happened, so everything is very much still a possibility. "	He's right it's much more constructive to speculate wildly about another persons career.

You tried cleaning it, it wasn't cleaning up and you looked up the manufacturer info and that was when you realized they don't recommend more than one user so you gave up trying to fix it. Then just apologize and say you didn't realize she would have wanted it back. You didn't want to come across as ungrateful so you were taken aback and that was why you hadn't mentioned it in the first place. Don't tack on a lie. I'm sure she will understand! :)	That's pretty much what I did.  I told her something spilled on it in storage from the looks of it and I tried cleaning it, but it got into the hose intake.  She thought it was funny I got so upset because she was just going to try donating it to a women's shelter.

>As Slate recently pointed out, Trump has revealed the weaknesses in Silver's models, while his obviously negative opinion of Trump has caused him to start acting like all the traditional Beltway pundits he made his career out of denouncing.

Isn't it a little early for the anti-Silver circlejerk to start sucking each other's dicks? "	"&gt; I wasn't aware that Trump had played in the finals nor won the nomination. Interesting...

I'd say the chance of the latter happening is exponentially better than the chance of the former right now.

Since when is linking to an article ""circlejerking"" and ""sucking each other's dicks?""

I get Silver's appeal, and yes, there was the embarrassing Unskewed Polls fiasco. But IMO, the article I linked raises some legitimate criticisms of Silver's analysis that aren't just ""boo hoo, he's picking the candidate I don't like."" Silver's a smart guy, but he's not infallible."

135		czj4sf6	Truecels		"Humans as well as other animals have more 'biologically programmed' mating strategies, but basically they divide into two categories
1) have as many children as much as you can and with as many man as possible so that your children will be as diverse as possible. 

This is the main mating strategy for women in underdeveloped societies: south america, africa, etc.

2)pair-bonding strategy. Have one make that will take care of you and your offspring and offer him sexual exclusivity so that he will be sure the children are all his and will take care of all of them and stay with you. This makes the man to feel so-called 'love' for the woman. Marriage was invented for this specific strategy. It was invented to encourage people to use this mating strategy so that man will not focus on competing for women but focus on science, writing and advancing of society. That is why societies that were more traditional managed to become much much more technological advanced than the ones that had the 'fight each other to pump and dump women'.


If a woman already had sex with many men, she knows subconsciously that the pair-bonding strategy is less and less likely to work for her as man are programmed to bond with females who are only theirs because they do not want to end in a situation to provide for a child that is not his.
In this case the instincts of the woman 'switch' to the first strategy- be pumped and dumped by the most strong, the most seductive men and have as many children as possible to make sure at least some of them survive. She needs to have more children because without a man to provide for her a lower percentage of children will have chances at survival. Thus she becomes what we call today a 'slut'.

This two types of strategies were vastly studied and appear in animals and also in humans.


In a civilized society a 'paid-bonding strategy' is the norm and allows the society to advance. 
A society that has 'pump-and-dump' as a strategy will become more and more a shit-hole. This is the reason that black communities in US live in such poverty and violence. This is their strategy. Be aggressive, fight other men, prove to women you are violent enough to survive to have a chance to pump her.

The whites had a very different strategy and created a very different societies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory

Read about a very interesting species where males with different mating strategies have different colour (a proof that the mating strategy also has genetical factor)
