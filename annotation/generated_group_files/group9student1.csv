A simple reading could go something like ""to be learned is good ... just don't try to learn or think TOO much ...."" which can easily be abused into a very anti-science mentality which can be quite harmful.

OTOH, we know the church actually does support higher learning and science (just look at the STEM programs at BYU and the research they do, etc.). 

How can people reconcile the conflict between ""keep things simple / don't think too much"" and the need to think and analyze the world around us?"	"I'm not sure where you're getting the ""don't try to learn too much"" from this talk. I didn't sense that reading it. 

Keeping things simple is a pretty important idea that makes a huge difference in my own life. I will never stop learning and studying. I don't see those two as mutually exclusive.

Hopefully, we're learning and holding each other accountable. Some of the posters in this thread apologized to OP in later comments. No group is perfect but I'd say over all, we're a decent bunch. 	Touché. You make really good points, and I see the apologies from posters that you mentioned now. Most other subreddits can be pretty ruthless when it comes to attacks, but this one is generally positive. Defensive at times, like you said, but overall positive. :)

&gt; &amp;quot;Yesterday&amp;#039;s illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people,&amp;quot; said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement announcing the latest sanctions on the Latin American country.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s decision to sanction Maduro is not as severe as broader economic sanctions on Venezuela&amp;#039;s oil industry.

&gt; Last week, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 government and military officials tied to Maduro.

27		dgywggi	AskReddit		"I began a long affair with a girl that was married. We had a ton of moments but I'll recount just a few for you.

We'd always hook up while her husband was at work, being that he neither had his drivers license or could even drive at all, there was no chance of him walking in on us. So one day I show up for a romp and we get down and dirty, and after we finish I casually ask ""hey do you have a towel or something i can use to clean up?"" and she tosses me some cloth and I wipe myself off. It wasn't until after that i realized she had given me her husbands pajama pants and i wiped our sexjuices off on his pants.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."

That's a joke but a lot of the ""highlights"" posted here aren't so much highlights in the ""oh wow"" sense but in the ""look at this quirk in the game"" sense which then facilitates discussion. I do wonder what becomes of those under the new rules. Hopefully the mods exercise some discretion."

33	dkzov6q	dkzph7m	BigBrother	I'm not able to watch right now, but I got a text from my Mom who is and she seems to think Alex is on the block?  That doesn't seem correct to me, but did anything in the game actually happen?  I know the PoV ceremony was today and that Paul took Jason down, but what made the whole blow up happen?	"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."

36	dkzaj16	dkzy03a	CanadaPolitics	"While this article is generally on-point, I'm going to point out this flaw about our healthcare system:

> Even today, it’s a mishmash by province, and the strains of the system are evident in months- to years-long waits for low-priority treatments such as back surgeries and hip replacements. **Wealthy Canadians can, and do, travel to the United States to receive these treatments.** And they pay for what they get locally, too, in taxes: The nation spends an average of $5,000 per person on health care each year.

I'm tired of hearing this when it's not true. Everyone seems to have a story about their wealthy friend who ran down to Detroit because they were sick of waiting for an MRI, but data just doesn't support the idea that this is an epidemic or anything more than a *very* uncommon occurrence by only the wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians. 

[This widely-cited, peer-reviewed study from 2002](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full) used multiple strategies to evaluate Canadian-to-US healthcare crossings—including contacting hospitals in Washington, Michigan and New York and contacting the 50 best-known and best-ranked hospitals in the United States—and concluded that **""Results from these sources do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States**. Indeed, **the numbers found are so small as to be barely detectible** relative to the use of care by Canadians at home."" [Here's a comprehensive video that cites the study, as well as several other myths about our healthcare system.](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0?t=3m58s)

None of this is to blunt the criticism against Trudeau—he certainly didn't enable our healthcare system to become what it is—but this is a myth that I'm tired of seeing."	How do they obtain personal medical information to come to their conclusions?

There are 2 theories: I was the last one hired and they didn't realize how many 14 year olds would quit in week 1 or 2- Chuck really was the creepy pedophile everyone thought he was and I was a guy. The place almost exclusively hired girls and every guy was eventually fired for very strange reasons. For instance, my friend was fired for ""sweeping the floor wrong"", whatever that's supposed to mean. Never did find out which it was. Creepydude died 15 ish years ago I heard. He and his wife didn't live in town, they lived in an rv and only came to town in the summer. That was the reason given for the bed in the basement, but it conveniently gave ol' Chuck ample material for ""jokes"" to the 14 year old girls.

Personal favorites aside from stuff that hasn't been mentioned this far:

How Did This Get Made(Comedy) : June Diane Raphael, Paul Scheer, and Jason Mantzoukas plus guest discuss bad films. 

Risk! (storytelling): my favorite storytelling podcast. Hosted by Kevin Allison(formerly of The State), people tell true stories that are funny, scary, deeply emotional, et cetera. 

Last Podcast on the Left(comedy/horror): these guys discuss all things scary with a bit of comedy mixed in. Their serial killers editions are probably the best. 

Honorable mention... 

We're Alive(serial audio drama): probably the best audio drama out there. It's a zombie apocalypse one in the vein of TWD, but I dig it and they're about a half hour long per episode.

The summer between 8th and 9th grade I started dating my SO and he gently encouraged me to start eating more regularly. It hurt so much to eat more than one meal a day and it made me nauseous. I felt like I just couldn't fit more than one meal a day in me.

I'm now ending my freshman year of college and I'm within an average weight range for my height and age. I still don't eat a lot, maybe one meal and a few snacks throughout the day. If I eat ""too much"", which usually is a big plate full of food, I feel sick and in pain, but I can eat more than I could before.

Guys put up with it because when sex does happen, when an orgasm is allowed, it's usually mind-blowingly awesome if the denial and the chastity was done correctly for their specific personalities. 

I have heard of nonsexual power exchange, especially from married couples where one person is kinky and the other is not, and no one is comfortable quite yet with their significant other having a sexual relationship with another. The ironic part is that D/s and power exchange is so intimate even without sex. 

It does seem common for straight Dommes to be into chastity. Whether that's a straight female thing or not is beyond my wisdom though. ha. I'm not male but I'm with you. A sexless relationship is -not- what I want and I would end a relationship that turned out to be sexless.

70	czgkg1s	czj671x	Bitcoin	"> and 2MB hard fork is clearly not destructive for the network and decentralization.

This is my whole frustration.  2MB isn't going to break anything or cause centralization, so why can't everyone get onboard with it?  I understand not moving to 20MB or 200MB, but 2MB?  What's the big deal?  Do people think it'll be a slippery slope or something?"	"Why are you whining like a baby over 2MB when 1.75MB is already being rolled out? Are you that pathetic that you can't wait for the next doubling already on the horizon on the roadmap?

There's not a single valid reason you can come up with to do 2MB before SW. But since you already buried your head in the sand earlier you put yourself in a position where you'd lose face if you don't get your demands met.

You've been given plenty of opportunity to get your head out of your ass without much loss of face.

The mere fact that you think there's even a possibility of setting demands and making compromises displays the degree of misunderstanding you have. This is science at work not some miss America competition."
71		czj4ebm	AskReddit		"I was in a meeting at a software company.  The chief architect said, ""Excuse me for the seg-you, but...""  Everyone paused and looked at him.  He meant segue, which is pronounced like the company ""Segway"".  Everyone got a good laugh out of it."

76	dgyrye5	dgytkrm	Wetshaving	I've seen warnings on plastic spray bottles before not to put high alcohol content liquids in them (i.e. Fragrances). I'm not sure exactly what happens or if it's a theoretical or actual risk.	"I think that's a contentious topic in the fragrance community. I believe some will never use or buy anything with a plastic atomizer since it allegedly distorts the fragrance. I for one have never noticed a problem with the maggard atomizers.

u/yottapirx, I don't think there's too much of a difference. I personally put it in my palm so that I don't accidentally spray on my eyes.

78		dgyzo2i	RocketLeagueExchange		White and crimson roulletes and hexed for victor white zombas 
79		dkztr10	FFBraveExvius		"Delita is evil. He is the monster that he sought to destroy and while he is perhaps sympathetic, he murders or betrays everyone in his quest for power. Ovelia tries to give him his just rewards but unfortunately fails.

You have a very....generous interpretation of events. I haven't played either version since the WotL release on PSP, but I've played this game a dozen times so I'm gonna try and poke at them.

&gt;Delita then uncovers a traitorous councilor to Goltanna and executes him, earning Goltanna's favor. 

My impression is that the councilor was a fall guy for Delita's actions, who actually was the spy. It's possible he was another spy, but likely Delita simply framed him for the Hokuto plot and murdered him to get him out of the way and gain Goltana's trust. The only evidence is a witness that Delita himself provides, and he kills him before any objections can be made.


&gt; Delita successfully kills Goltanna, but instead of killing Orlandeau, Delita kills a lookalike and lets the real TG Cid go with Ramza in his search for the church's true goal. Delita then assumes Goltanna's position as head of the Southern Sky.

I've seen the idea that Delita let Orlandu go, but this is highly unlikey. The stand-in that Delita kills is a member of the Glabados church provided for the purpose of framing Orlandu for Goltana's murder (this is explicit in the japanese version that he's a member of the church). There's no reason to let Orlandu go except to betray the Templar knights (of which Delita is a member), and there's no way the church would provide a stand-in to help betray themselves. Further, Orlandu walks away with one of the Auracites when Ramza busts him out of jail. Considering the Templars gave him that stone, they had to have known that Orlandu escaped with it and Delita killed a stand-in or else they would have come looking for their stone to give to someone else to use.


&gt; At the same time, Valmafra, learning of Delita's betrayal as he speaks to Orran, struggles to carry out her orders to kill Delita. Delita senses her hesitation, and taunts her to kill him. Instead, Valmafra abandons her orders and serves Delita.

Does she? Or does he just capture her until after he becomes king?

&gt; Finally, Orran tries to uncover the church's plot and is burned at the stake as a heretic; it is unknown what power Delita had to stop this event.

The power of being the most powerful man in the country. If Delita didn't want Orran to die, he wouldn't have let Orran die.

&gt;  Delita spared Ramza several times, as well as spared Orlandeau

The second is questionable at best. The first is just not true. Delita never tries to fight Ramza, and given that he relies on Ramza to slay the Lucavi instead of trying to do so himself, it's unlikely he would have emerged triumphant. He probably also knew this having grown up with him, and hence never tried. Besides, as you point out, Ramza was needed for that whole Lucavi problem.

Delita MEANS well, but he becomes a black-hearted fiend at the end. Ovelia recognized it. Everyone else should as well."

I mainly fear about display.

So, if is true that is all same in sp3keyboard and sp4keyboard (magnets too) so it's nice information for me. Save me some money. Because before I sold my sp3 so I was okay with sp3keyboard so I will not need newest."	It is all universal, if you really wanted to you could use the original type cover with a sp4.

Like, I have vision impairments where glasses help me see better. Yet I don't differentiate between perfectly sighted people and non... or try to lament on how those that don't have vision problems offend me for using certain phrases.

Why is having hearing problems a main source of your identity? How different is deaf culture than non deaf culture? "	There was a lot of shit done to deaf people until somewhat recently that galvanized the deaf community and instilled a pride of unity apart from those who are hearing.

  Also, I've seen a lot of birth/gender announcment videos where people seem to think that ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo dolls is some sweet happy song. Do people actually listen to lyrics before they choose songs for occasions like that anymore?? How many Goo Goo Dolls songs are happy? One?"	None. Actually, I think Iris pushes them into negative territory...

116		dkztx46	EnterShikari		I was there. New songs are all bangers and build on the sound of Live Outside but more on the heavy Shikari side!
117	dgytip0	dgz10an	LifeProTips	"Even worse than that, there are a lot of things in life that you can't easily explain to another person when they ask, ""what's wrong?""   There are medical conditions people don't know about, family trauma that isn't as simple as an abusive or narcissistic parent (not that I'm downplaying those by any means), and lastly there are things that we can be exposed to that simply change us permanently and there really isn't any going back.   Attempting to explain these things to others usually ends with them being trivialized or marginalized because nobody likes hearing about a problem that can't be explained in under a minute, because then they regret having asked the question.   Remember that many times when people ask the question, ""what's wrong?"",  they don't actually want to know,  they just want the dopaminic release that comes with the belief that you somehow helped somebody with 45 seconds of listening.    Sometimes you just have to carry it with you and keep it to yourself.  And if you do find someone that actually cares, that spends the time to fully comprehend what it is you are going through, then you better make time for them as well, because they are rare and they deserve a full listen as well.    "	"I think if I talk fast I can explain why the drug war is wrong.

Do I get another minute to explain why it continues?"

119		dgyxmxm	SquaredCircle		The arena booed him earlier but now they're all fireflies 
120		dgyvycm	SeattleWA		I would assume the next best step is a name and shame campaign on social media.  Either that or Get Jesse.  
121		dgytvkf	Persona5		Not really a prediction, but I was thinking it would be cool if the MC had a rival with a Wild Card too or a copycat wild card from another place dealing with his own probs (Like if Yu and Akira would suddenly meet up and compete and stuff). The rival will obviously be trying to thwart your progress or get in front of you all the time (without being annoying), but there could also be moments of camaraderie, as a social link or something like that. Might be cool.
122		dgyse9m	The_Donald		At least we'll get to call WW3 a holy war and liberate the continent from Islam again.
123		dgyxigc	Drugs		Is stealing drugs (and not getting caught) plausible when you work in a hospital? 
124	dkyxlvv	dkzw4rf	AskReddit	They had to be guided to the door. Store policy states that someone has to man the office at all times, so I notified the police. Moments later, they arrived and safely led them outside. Turns out there was an opening in the back of the store. 	What kind of job opening were the ducks interested in?
125		czjdxzd	AskReddit		3kingdomspodcast. I've played an loved every dynasty warrior game but actually reading the book was fairly difficult for me. He explains everything that happens in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms step by step while also explaining the myriad of allusions every character uses all the time. 
126		dkzyr3b	AskReddit		He was the classic trench coat wearing guy (a lot of high schools have one), but he also carried a briefcase everyday that apparently held a chalice that he allegedly would put milk in.  Our school had a mouse problem and one was spotted one day and he just scooped up the mouse and put it in his briefcase.  Additionally he thought the waiter at olive garden was trying to poison him during a dinner for an extra curricular trip.
127	dgyjpl1	dgyti31	Music	Snowstorm*	You misspelled Sandstorm by Darude ...
128		dgyy8rh	AskReddit		I did. Fuck that guy. Also spoiler alert.  
129	dgy6q8y	dgyusdw	AskReddit	I did not hit her. Is not true. It's boolshit. I did not hit her. I did naht. Oh hi Mark!	Said Johnny Depp.
130		czj67ch	HailCorporate		I really enjoy these properly amended titles popping up on my front page. This one gave me an especially good little chuckle. Not even going to follow the link, it just feels like a nice little dose of anti-advertising reading the title. 
131		czj4r7d	GlobalOffensiveTrade		Rust Knife for 62k?
132	czjcyf1	czjd08p	Rainbow6	Everyone agrees Kapkan's laser and bolt needs some toning down. We're also all in agreement that IQ is pretty much worthless, except for her guns. 	Being vocal doesn't make something true. Not understanding the purpose/intent/practical implementation of the operator is the fault of the end user.
133	cziybwr	czj4d1v	DotA2	[verwijderd]	Hold my gold, I'm going in!
134	dgyrq4m	dgytd1a	JUSTNOMIL	She has a decades long habit of doing this when one or more people are in the living room.  And everybody pretends it's not happening.	You deserve a parade
135		dkzy3q4	AskReddit		Where?  Germany.  But you asked the wrong question fool!
136	dkzfszp	dkzq31a	AskPhotography	"Well currently I own three lenses and primarily use one. If I went D750 I'd keep that one and sell the other two (keep the FX and sell the DX's), so I probably wouldn't spend more on lenses for a little while.

If I got the K1 I would have to sell all three lenses, and would only replace the one (50mm f/1.8G is the one I use the most), so no more than $300, but I'd probably get an old film lens used since the Pentax is already more money and I'd be starting over with lenses "	Sounds to me like you already made up your mind before you posted this, op. You were just looking for confirmation. Buy the pentax and enjoy.
137	czj9ija	czjf4my	Gunners	"It's a shit joke disrespectful to our players.

And give me 1 reason it's disrespectful to make a mutual agreement with Rosicky for him to leave on the grounds of him being a football invalid. Both parties can move on."	Disrespectful to our players over something called the Banter Era? You want to terminate the contract of a player who's been at our club for 10 years 5 months before his contract ends. I find it disrespectful to the premier league that you think Ospina is the best 2nd choice GK.

140	czj7sni	czj85l3	Warthunder	Puts the F-35 project into perspective.	"F-35 is a strike fighter though, nothing like a strategic bomber. Considering WWII was the last time the US fought a real full-scale conventional war, strategic bombers and dedicated air-superiority fighters aren't really needed for the kind of conflicts we see in modern times. Strike fighters and multipurpose fighters have been the trend for nearly 50 years now.

Kinda hard to want to talk to people like that when literally half the country are just blatant jerks. "	More like many feminists have become more anti-male than pro-equality; we shouldn't change the definition of marriage for a small percentage of outliers, there are racists but don't blame all of black people's problems on whites, just because you deserve something doesn't mean govt should guarantee it, and people should be responsible for themselves, and in the rare case they can't, private voluntary charity should take over.
