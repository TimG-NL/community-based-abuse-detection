0		czjayls	Frugal		"please do supplement your food by taking advantage of community meals! generally food stamps cover fresh stuff (fruit, produce, meat/fish) and stuff that you need to expend effort to prepare (frozen fried chicken, yes; fried chicken from the deli counter that is cheaper, no)

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

edit: wanted to add that if you can arrange with someone to get mail at their place, do it. It's really hard to get a new job (or other benefits) with no address."

9	czj8br0	czj9vsu	Vive	I don't think Oculus will release the pricing for the Touch anytime soon. They learned their lesson about not releasing pricing early, as they got a ton of backlash for the $600 Rift. I also hear they're having a lot of problems getting the Touch technology to work because of connectivity issues and extremely low battery life which may pose an issue even a year from now and may affect the pricing, which is another reason they probably won't disclose the price ahead of time. But I am pretty sure it won't be less than $200 because it includes a whole other camera (which I hear they're also having issues with) and two controllers. I'd imagine it might even cost up to $300. Vive is seriously your best bet.	Don't get me wrong I want a Vive it just depends on how much it costs up front. I don't see the camera being that much on the touch, it's a camera ya know? They are pretty cheap these days. I hadn't heard about the tracking issues but if so that's a definite issue that would change my opinion. I'm just afraid Vive is going to come out over $1k and if that's the case I'll definitely go rift.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.  

It's also not saying good or bad.  It's just saying, I don't think 5% guaranteed annual rate of return."
36		dkzs1df	FORTnITE		I played on PC since the Alpha and it acts as my main account but I also have friends on xbox to play with so I purchased it again. Similar thing happened, I played for a few days and finally got an error message when logging in via Xbox and when I went back to PC it wouldn't let me in either. The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days. The whole making you go through the tutorial again I didn't have to deal with so that sounds scary.... I don't know if my fix will help with you... but if it does, yay?

38		dkztdu2	Entrepreneur		"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."

Islam gave women the right to choose their spouse without force, unrestricted education, allowed women to actively fight in wars, allowed women to become scholars (in fact, the oldest University that's still running was founded by a Muslim woman, 12 centuries ago. Furthermore, Muslim women were given the right to work, and wives were also given the right to work and gain income (in fact, the husband is forbidden to touch his wife's hard-earned money), Muslim women were allowed to not take their husband's family name upon marriage, plus the husband's parents isn't the wife's responsibility to take care of. And trust me, I'm only getting started. Say what you like about the corrupt Muslim leaders and scholars who bastardize Islam's teachings, then I'll agree with you.

Women being treated as second-class citizens is mostly down to the fall of the Ottoman empire (at least between Persia and the Levant), which made the breeding ground of corrupt scholars and leaders destroying what's left of those area's moral integrity. Saudi Arabia is down to the appointment of a corrupt tribe with the help of the British.

If you have actually cared to read the links I posted, then you know that Islam (in it's untainted form) is totally against rape of all kinds. Why did you ignore it? Y u do dis, man?"	you probably know more about it than me since you are muslim, so i'll just believe you. sorry dude, just obviously, this shit makes people angry and feel irrational hatred.

The other thing is that I'd probably be renting in an apartment building, so the landlord might be some random company rather than a real person who is willing to work with me.

95		dkzreo0	Advice		An excuse is standing somewhere between you and the next step you need to take. – If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way.  If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.  This may be tough to accept, but it’s the truth.  Stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  The only person who can truly hold you back is you.  So no more excuses – it’s time to change.  It’s time to choose what’s best for YOU.  Oftentimes when we feel stuck, we are waiting for something magical to happen.  We wonder when the winds will change in our favor.  We do this instead of embracing the present and admitting the change we need to make.  What is keeping you from stepping forward?  If not fear of failure, then what?  Insecurity?  Laziness?  What is your excuse?  We all have one.  And when we focus on our excuses more than our steps forward, we walk in a circle and fall into the familiar pit we call “Stuck.”

&gt;Why are you so insecure about your dick? I'm seriously asking

Dude responds:

&gt;wat, no I'm not... I am about everything else though... the dick is the only good thing on me, that's not the point... He implied that I said ""blacks don't have bigger dicks/ women usually don't even like big dicks"" because I have a small dick and I was saying that because I'm butthurt . By posting my 8 + inch penis I provided proof that I'm not saying that because I'm butthurt about my small penis because I clearly don't have one and that the reason I said that is because I have seen how women feel about my penis. I provided proof for my personal experience to back up my claim. It's not about a fucking dick."

104	dgwdvsa	dgywo82	EARONS	Why do we assume that he was the one who made the map? Notebooks often get used by several people. Perhaps his mom or dad or older sibling had used this particular notebook before. Or perhaps those pages were dropped by someone totally unrelated to the crimes. 	the homework handwriting matches the writing on the back of the map. 
105	dkzddx2	dkzq3od	TibiaMMO	What place is Shargon's hideout? never heard of it	I don't even know if that's really the name of it. It's the two floors under oramond furies, which is the last part of the dark trails quest. Since it's a mix of furies, dark torturers, undead dragons and some other stuff, it can be pretty reasonable experience as well as profit.
106	dkyxrxk	dkzrpz5	Shadowverse	...why did you liquify Grimnir? He's still an amazing card. It was more of a love tap than a nerf.	I disagree. The only deck I can see wanting Grimnir now is Dragon, because it can comfortably ramp to 10 and use it as an effective boardwipe. Not having the reach to close out the game was much harder than just a lovetap and I wouldn't be surprised to see it dropped from the crafts that have better 3 drops.

I'm usually not very good at all at predicting that stuff, but it was no surprise at all.  I think it's because he kept going on about how he has a very good memory and how he was able to pull up a wealth of information at a moment, like Sherlock.

My annoyance was much less slight though when I worked at a restaurant where the chef/owner pronounced it like that. I mean she had a very grating personality in general, so that definitely added to it. Still though, this is a recipe she wrote, and when the chipotle powder she uses for it runs out, she's the one who orders more, and when customers complain about it, she's the one they talk to, meaning that she has to have heard the correct pronunciation hundreds of times throughout the time she's had it on the menu but she just doesn't care.

&gt; A team of researchers from Italy&amp;#039;s University of Trieste and the Cambridge Graphene Center recently made significant headway in this direction when it successfully demonstrated that untreated graphene can be used to interface with neurons without damaging their integrity.

* which state they live in
* male or female for gender
* which way someone votes

It's okay to only want responses from a particular group of people (Americans, Males / Females, 18+); you just need to make sure that you are requesting those things in the demographic section of your survey title.
