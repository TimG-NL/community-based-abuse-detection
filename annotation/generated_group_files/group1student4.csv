He looks amazing when playing in MLS, but besides a few bright moments he looks mostly average when playing in international games so far. I think he doesn't have as much confidence. I really hope he can adapt and become a key player for the US.

5	dkz4mby	dkzobbh	AskReddit	"Not political propaganda, but Rick and Morty brought back szechuan sauce.

Ever since the season premiere of Rick and Morty, people have been repeating szechuan sauce at each other like a pop-culture Freemason handshake. Lo and behold, at the start of the season proper, McDonald's creates a limited release of this obtuse dipping sauce from 1998 most people don't actually remember tasting (if it were really that popular at its release, McDonald's would have made use of it since then). 

People are high-fiving thinking ""we did it"" when McDonald's announces the sauces return (around the same time as the proper season start). This is classical cross promotion at its finest. McDonald's get a PR spike in a demographic it has been spending a lot of money, [and making stupid commercials to court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTxJZyKymA). The premier might as well have been a giant focus group to turn attention their way. If it all had backlash, then it would simply be a gag from a comedy show, but it didn't. 

Rick and Morty advertised for McDonald's, and now we're seeing a very traditional cross promotion and everybody is patting themselves on the back like they made it happen and weren't manipulated the entire way through. "	I totally agree it was an advertisement, but I'd like to counter with this: Who cares? If it was a good part of the overall show and the viewers enjoyed it... Does it really matter? Should we completely avoid using companies just to stop them from potentially advertising?

21	czj6cmy	czja87d	APStudents	From what I heard, Bio is considered harder than Environmental Science, that might be very ignorant, I am not sure, though I rather have Calc instead of Environmental science in Senior Year and have AP Bio as my science.	"You're not ignorant. Bio *is* harder than Envi Sci, that's a fact. Only 5% of people get a 5 on AP Bio. 

Don't waste your time taking AP Envi Sci, stay with AP Lang.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

You will come out of that class wishing you were back in it."

It's difficult  to find the line where it's the persons fault or the salesman, it's not all black and white.. a person that buys a snake oil drug that's supposed to cure something is one thing,  because medicine  is complex and not something  a layman would understand, mix that with the desperation  of an awful disease it's understandable... so I do feel sympathy  for a person  caught in a scam like that..

But if you think a pair of shoes will help you lose weight, then you deserve to lose the 80 bucks you spent on those shoes, because it's pretty  common  knowledge that there is no magic weight loss thing..

But if you are running dungeons/fractals with people that are not very skilled at the game, a healer can really help to carry those people. 

So in conclusion, only raids need tanks and healers. As for the other content in the game, you shouldn't need those roles, but very low skilled players might make use of it."	To be fair, druids at high level fractals can be very nice. Not necessary, but very, very convenient.

37	dgyoq2c	dgyrwj1	pie	OP, can I get a recipe? I've tried the two in my Pie Town, NM cookbook but they both turned out too dry	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)"

The way her curls tickled his face and chest was pleasant  as was all the sensations, but something more brought him calm; the feeling of loneliness and isolation melting away in the hands of his tiny princess. How one person could do that, he did not know, but he was content for once not to question it. 

His eyes started to grow heavy but they snapped open at the sound of Helaena's voice and concern flooded his body as she spoke. Honesty? Truth that would hurt? What on earth did that mean? 

His muscles tensed unconsciously with the foreboding that filled him, but his answer was simple and honest. He was who he was. He didn't think he had the heart to lie to her. ""Of course,"" he whispered. ""Although it would pain me to see you hurt, I couldn't lie to you. Why are you so concerned?"" "	"""It's not...It's not that I'm concerned. Or that I expect you to lie, I just...""

She just needed to hear him make the promise. But that wasn't what was important here. Perhaps he would be honest, perhaps he would not. She wouldn't blame him for being hesitant in his honesty, or in lying to himself as much as her. 

She took a deep breath, and clung to him more tightly. 

""I was wed, and married for seven days. I was fond of my husband, I desired him, I enjoyed being with him. I gave him my maidenhead, and we made love every night of our brief time together.""

80		dkzoozs	UnresolvedMysteries		"What I find curious is that the OP created this account 25 days ago, with the vast majority of its activity happening on this post. Ordinarily one would think that this is because the OP who allegedly knew the girl wanted to remain anonymous, yet the OP fully described her occupation, work schedule, and salary [in another post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ll4rw/people_who_dont_work_normal_3540_hrsweek_jobs_and/djv80hb/)

Perhaps this is irrelevant, but I find the staggered activity on the account peculiar, particularly when the OP claims to have seen the girl and be associated with one of her friends. If this was a publicity stunt like the Sherri case, I couldn't think of a better way of reinvigorating the story than pretending to be implicitly involved with the missing girl.

They've been taught a cherry-picked version of religion, so while they might spout off the basics easily, any deep discussion of theological principles will leave them baffled in short order, and they might be misinformed about basic details of how religion even functions. 

think about the what the cult would want to keep hidden, or lie about. he might know how a cell is organized, but his knowledge of how to contact a cell might have been all lies. he might not know who heads the cult, or if he does, only knows them as a shadowy figure giving out kill orders. if the cult higher ups say, intend to offer up the footsoldiers to tiamat as a snack, he might not know that, because the cult would want to leave out details that might break the narrative "

That was literally the longest that I could last, and I was up with guilt-ridden nightmares for both of the nights in between. The thing is, I wasn't working a sales gig (at least not in the traditional sense): I was a ""talent scout"" for an incredibly shady organization that sought to trick parents into purchasing ""acting and modeling lessons"" for their kids.

There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.

That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session.

Unless, that is, they paid even *more* money to have their kids stay in the bogus class.

146	czjczee	czjdt4a	AskReddit	"I think it's a little simplistic to suggest that they're basically different side of the same coin, I think we're past horse shoe politics. But, yeah, I can see what you're saying about both coming across as honest, which is refreshing to anyone. In fact I think they both poll very high in people perception of their honesty. Both are also definitely playing politics. Sanders definitely avoids saying things he believes for fear of bad press. I'll give you that Sanders ""demonizes"" the rich (even if that's not what I might call it), but he doesn't fear monger people with death like Trump does with terrorists. 

Getting rid of Muslims in America is not really on par with providing tax payer funded health care, which many countries already do. First, there's the matter of scale. Health care affects practically everyone, and I can't imagine that ISIS has been involved in more than 100 American (civilian) deaths. 

Maybe this is unfair to say, you tell me. Conservatives have a higher/better fear response, and consequently, the more successful conservative politicians will be those that fear monger. I honestly don't think you can say there's an equal opposite for the left. It's a stretch to say that Sanders is advertising free health care using fear. Being on the left and having nearly my entire social circle being on the left, issues like health care and minimum wage and wealth distribution in general appeal to my peers and I because of issues of fairness and opportunity, not fear, exactly.

I also think it's inaccurate to say that Sanders is money or power hungry. Sanders came from politics and social work basically promoting fairness (whether or not you agree with that or his/the liberal interpretation of ""fairness""). Trump came from being a business man. Granted, that means he has already come from money and power, and might not necessarily be seeking it in running for president."	Sanders himself doesn't need to do the fearmongering, but leftists are always like 'if the government(taxpayers) doesn't pay your healthcare, then you'll be bankrupt after 1 ER visit!'. Still, the socialist tactic seems to be more pity based. Like those stupid sad puppy Sarah McLaughlin commercials.
147		dkznleg	DotA2		"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out.

**EDIT**
Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation: 

* Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.
* ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info!)
* Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.
* While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and *maybe* it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.
* All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead.


So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE  WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED!"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before."
