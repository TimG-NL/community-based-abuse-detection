47	czgtqcs	czjdqfx	DaystromInstitute	People are not answering the question I posed. I will clarify. When Sisko retook DS9, Dukat was in Federation custody now had the war ended at that point or shortly there after would the other parties convene a trial for Dukat using him as a bargaining chip to force the Dominion to surrender.  Sisko, Martok and Senator Velal could force concessions onto the Dominion by holding a public trial of Cardassia's former leader. My question is not about the outcome of the war rather it is about the methods open to the Alliance in prosecuting the war.      	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sh#t about the Cardassians time and time again.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."

What's going on here is an induced vomiting. Basically we take a drug called apomorphine to make your dog puke. Works great for recent ingestions of some foreign objects and poisons. You can do this at home by making them drink a small amount of hydrogen peroxide too. 

However, one thing this video illustrates really well is ""abdominal effort."" those dry heaves you see before he vomits are what help us differentiate ""vomiting"" from ""regurgitation."" regurgitation can occur hours after eating, but many people just call it ""vomiting/puking"" incorrectly. If you can show your vet that you know the difference, it will really help us pinpoint certain diseases/pathologies and make us love you forever. 

Edit: 

Home vomit recipe (3% hydrogen peroxide): 1 teaspoon per 5 lbs., not to exceed 3 tablespoons. 

This dog is vomiting. Vomiting is an active process, while regurgitation is not. Vomiting is often after signs of nausea (licking lips, drooling, inappetance) and abdominal effort (heaving). Regurgitation occurs very suddenly and even midstride. "	So which is in the video

The problem is that we don't have any evidence that human beings innately possess some type of similar moral code, or that the universe has a moral code.

So in the State of Nature there's no such thing as ""murder"" there is just intentional killing. Murder is a dangerous word for you to throw around by the way, because it has a component of being illegal, and it assumes or implies a wrongful or morally wrong killing. So using the word is sort of like begging the question.

If Sam has a banana farm and George wants the banana farm, in the State of Nature where there is no prior agreement or understanding between the two, of course George can take the banana farm. He should probably kill or enslave Sam while doing so because leaving Sam free after taking the banana farm will likely lead Sam to try to kill George while he sleeps and take back the banana farm.

Murder is wrong in our society and to me, but in your hypothetical situation where there is just Sam and George and a banana farm there is no such thing as murder, and George killing Sam for it is neither right nor wrong. We can have a debate about whether it is the optimal decision, but we'd need a more complex scenario."

It is simple. X-games sees something they can make money on and add it. If you win, you get a gold medal. A gold medal says you did the best at your thing, not all the things.

You can't compare any of the different gold medals in the X-games. I bet this person can't play video games competitively and I bet a pro video gamer can't beat Ken Block in a rally race."	Well to be fair even Ken Block can't win a rally race.

A couple weeks ago I took a cab from my old place to Chinook Mall. I tried to tell him he could drive around the block because it loops around and the drive **argued** with me and said ""he's here all the time, the road doesn't loop around) and continued to take the LONGEST possible route there, thus resulting in a fare that's usually around $7 to become a $24 fare..

107	czisey6	czj6zpd	MakingaMurderer	[verwijderd]	"OP used the word ""simpleton."" *I* used the word ""simplistic."" Just setting the record straight.

I'll not soon forget a night in the early '80's, not longer after I graduated from high school, when a friend of mine was visiting after having spent some time in England. We were out in a bar, and he asked me for a cigarette using British vernacular, ""Would you spot me fag old chap?"" I swear, ice cubes stopped falling in mid air.

There's not a lot of diversity in the area. That lack of diversity, as a matter of course, leads to some attitudes and prejudices that are difficult to overcome. Those attitudes and prejudices are obvious to anyone who has spent a significant part of their lives living elsewhere. I do have nuanced discussions with some of my classmates, but all of those friends did spend a good part of their lives living outside the Green Bay area. This isn't a lack of education. It's a lack of experience.

The point isn't to just rag on these people. Indeed, the vast majority of them are good, kind-hearted people even if they are a bit anti-intellectual. Rather, as I mentioned in my earlier reply, this does speak to the basic question of the presumption of innocence. How can there be a presumption of innocence in a society where people are quick to judge and given to many prejudices that are, more often than not, fueled by rumor and gossip?

123	dgyus26	dgyx1s4	JRPG	">You don't choose a role in Bloodborne, you're always a hunter.

You get to choose what kind of hunter you are.  The points you allocate directly impact what abilities and equipment you have access to.  A player who puts all his points into Strength and Vitality plays significantly different than one who puts his points into Bloodtinge and Arcane.  The former is built to get up in someone's face and trade hits with something like the Kirkhammer, while the latter has traded durability and melee power for much stronger guns and access to magic items.

And while you could theoretically max out all your stats in Bloodborne, it'd take far beyond the normal playtime to do it.  In a normal playthrough, you don't come close to a fully maxed out character.

>You don't choose a role in Final Fantasy (except 1, 3 and 5), you don't choose a role in Tales.

This actually brings up a really interesting topic.  Most JRPGs *aren't* RPGs.  It's the reason the term ""JRPG"" is so divisive; they really contain very little role-playing.  The first ones, like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, were aping D&D on limited technology and have more in common with traditional RPGs.  They quickly veered off into their own style, though.  One that concentrated more on stories with defined characters instead of the player freedom that gives rise to role-playing.

If I had to rename them, I'd actually call the genre ""narrative adventure.""  Obviously that's not going to happen, but I feel like this is why JRPGs have become one of those things where it's hard to define, but ""I'll know it when I see it.""  They retain a few superfluous elements of D&D but abandoned the underlying purpose of tabletop games where ""RPG"" was coined.

I mean, I like JRPGs.  I just accept that their genre name is something of a misnomer."	"&gt; You get to choose what kind of hunter you are.

The different roles just determine your starting points which can be changed later but okay.

This results on less frequency on wound dressing changes and null chance of wound infection.
