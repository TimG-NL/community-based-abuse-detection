A simple reading could go something like ""to be learned is good ... just don't try to learn or think TOO much ...."" which can easily be abused into a very anti-science mentality which can be quite harmful.

OTOH, we know the church actually does support higher learning and science (just look at the STEM programs at BYU and the research they do, etc.). 

How can people reconcile the conflict between ""keep things simple / don't think too much"" and the need to think and analyze the world around us?"	"I'm not sure where you're getting the ""don't try to learn too much"" from this talk. I didn't sense that reading it. 

Keeping things simple is a pretty important idea that makes a huge difference in my own life. I will never stop learning and studying. I don't see those two as mutually exclusive.

We'd always hook up while her husband was at work, being that he neither had his drivers license or could even drive at all, there was no chance of him walking in on us. So one day I show up for a romp and we get down and dirty, and after we finish I casually ask ""hey do you have a towel or something i can use to clean up?"" and she tosses me some cloth and I wipe myself off. It wasn't until after that i realized she had given me her husbands pajama pants and i wiped our sexjuices off on his pants.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."

That doesn't seem correct to me, but did anything in the game actually happen?  I know the PoV ceremony was today and that Paul took Jason down, but what made the whole blow up happen?	"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."

36	dkzaj16	dkzy03a	CanadaPolitics	"While this article is generally on-point, I'm going to point out this flaw about our healthcare system:

> Even today, it’s a mishmash by province, and the strains of the system are evident in months- to years-long waits for low-priority treatments such as back surgeries and hip replacements. **Wealthy Canadians can, and do, travel to the United States to receive these treatments.** And they pay for what they get locally, too, in taxes: The nation spends an average of $5,000 per person on health care each year.

I'm tired of hearing this when it's not true. Everyone seems to have a story about their wealthy friend who ran down to Detroit because they were sick of waiting for an MRI, but data just doesn't support the idea that this is an epidemic or anything more than a *very* uncommon occurrence by only the wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians. 

[This widely-cited, peer-reviewed study from 2002](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full) used multiple strategies to evaluate Canadian-to-US healthcare crossings—including contacting hospitals in Washington, Michigan and New York and contacting the 50 best-known and best-ranked hospitals in the United States—and concluded that **""Results from these sources do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States**. Indeed, **the numbers found are so small as to be barely detectible** relative to the use of care by Canadians at home."" [Here's a comprehensive video that cites the study, as well as several other myths about our healthcare system.](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0?t=3m58s)

None of this is to blunt the criticism against Trudeau—he certainly didn't enable our healthcare system to become what it is—but this is a myth that I'm tired of seeing."	How do they obtain personal medical information to come to their conclusions?

The place almost exclusively hired girls and every guy was eventually fired for very strange reasons. For instance, my friend was fired for ""sweeping the floor wrong"", whatever that's supposed to mean. Never did find out which it was. Creepydude died 15 ish years ago I heard. He and his wife didn't live in town, they lived in an rv and only came to town in the summer.

Last Podcast on the Left(comedy/horror): these guys discuss all things scary with a bit of comedy mixed in. Their serial killers editions are probably the best.

We're Alive(serial audio drama): probably the best audio drama out there. It's a zombie apocalypse one in the vein of TWD, but I dig it and they're about a half hour long per episode.

How admirable of them. They can recognize holiness even in people who disagree with them."" And when I saw this morning at morning prayer in the BCP that it was St. Ignatius' feast day, I didn't think twice about it, because I'd already concluded the Anglicans are more open-minded than the Catholics in such matters.

I don't know about some of the other people venerated in the Anglican calendar that you all have mentioned already, but I always thought that the Catholic Church ought to canonize C. S. Lewis, and found it quite small-minded that they wouldn't. "	"How could the Catholic Church canonize C. S. Lewis, who was never a part of their church? It has absolutely nothing to do with being ""small-minded"" but simply with them adhering to their ecclesiology. Just because someone really was a good person or even a great Christian doesn't mean that we *ought* to formally commemorate them as a saint of the church. It's true that C. S. Lewis is a greatly admired figure among many Catholics today but it still doesn't change the fact that they were never in communion with him, *and how could any church presume to commemorate someone they didn't know in the Eucharistic body?* 

This doesn't mean that private veneration of saints outside the Church or even saints that haven't been officially commemorated can't occur, and I actually do know a handful of people, including myself, that venerate saints outside of our respective communions. But the public, corporate veneration of saints in our official calendars is a completely different story, and the current state of some of our Anglican Calendars is laughable. "

They did some research and found that most people who ordered coffee at the drive through left it in the cup holder until they got to work, at which point it had cooled down. They wanted to serve it hot enough that once customers got to work it would be the right temperature, but either ignored or failed to notice (have seen sources go both ways on this) that it was hot enough to cause massive trauma at basically any point prior to the end of the drive.	Maybe they left them in the cup holders until they got to work because they were too freaking hot to drink.
70		dkzpfug	Anxiety		"Firstly, I am sorry you have to go through such things. Alone each one is hard to deal with, so having a combination of issues is always much harder to get under control. As far as telling them goes.... Do you feel it would have a positive or negative impact on your life and/or mental health help? I personally feel it's always best to inform anyone you have daily interactions with, such as close family members, significant others, and closest friends. I feel this way because it helps them to better understand you, your actions and reactions to situations, and how to help when there's noticable behavior changes. It gives you a chance to build a support group within loved ones. If they are like my family was, which it sounds as though they are, maybe having pamphlets or literature for them to read that is science based to read themselves, as you break the news to them. Ignorance of a certain mental health condition can have a huge impact on how the conversation will go and how they accept what you have and deal with on a daily basis. Generalized opinions of conditions are worse to ""break through"" than if someone just doesn't know what it is at all. I attempted telling my aunt about my ocd paraphrasing studies and research mixing in my opinion and personal struggles. It went horribly. She was not only confused but overwhelmed and it caused her to basically shut down on me. So, when I brought the issues to my mother and step dad about a month later, I had gathered pamphlets and even printed out short articles and explanations of said disorder from medical sites. I had in depth breakdowns for later reads for them once they grasped the basic concepts. This method was very successful and after a few days, once she accepted I had mental issues and I assume replayed my life and now understood so many things I'd done growing up that she hadn't previously, she came to me with questions and the door was open for discussion and understanding. So, literature always helps unknowing parties grasp the basics and may allow for deeper insight. Another thing to consider is, do you feel you could better approach them once you have seen a professional and gained more knowledge yourself? Would being treated first benefit you more, via therapy or meds or both, in how you handle Thier reactions to the info drop? Each person is different in what approach is best for them, as well as each family in accepting said info and how they respond to it. Majority of Parents know when something is wrong or not right with Thier children, so it may go a lot better than one may think. Then again, parents also tend to see and not believe because its hard to fathom you have a child with mental health problems. Often you see the parent feeling it's Thier fault, they did xx or xx wrong and caused it, or some sort of outside factor causing it.

But you need to show some dedication to design. What I did was take art classes at a community college to get material for my admissions portfolio. I also lucked into a landscaping job that allowed me to design installations which I included in my portfolio. I have classmates that did a ""Career Discovery"" type program that some schools offer during the summer. They did theirs at Cal and I know the GSD has one too. It's designed for people like you to get some work done in a studio setting and figure out if you like it. And it helps when you apply to grad school. 

Good luck!"	Thank you! I will eventually be taking design classes, and I actually have a permaculture design due next weekend (but it's not so much it is about aesthetic appeal as it is applying permacultural conventions and pure functionality).

1. Firstly, it is a legal issue. I support legalization. Whatever your position in the morality of cannabis or any other substance for that matter, the questions ""should you use it"" and ""should the government try to stop you from using it"" are far too often conflated. 

2. Second, it is a moral issue. You are right that there is no specific prohibition on this according to the bible, at least as far as I am aware. Therefore, it is up to everyone's own personal feelings, and people of the same religion may make different choices. As long as it does not control your life, that is. 

3. Thirdly, it is a health issue. In some cases cannabis can actually be used to ease the pain of highly uncomfortable conditions. Drugs, in general, are of course bad for you (though not even as bad as alcohol) and so I steer away from it personally for this reason. "

I'll put it that way. :) 	"Just treat her like a ridiculous overgrown child and never expect anything different from her. Give her simple, clear directions and never any real responsibility (no babysitting) and then don't get too surprised or upset if she fails or messes up something. Only tell her things you don't mind everyone else knowing, and smile and nod and correct her like you would a child who is learning the ropes socially. Try to engage her but also keep her at arms length - she will be in your life forever, so how you react to her will determine how unhappy this fact makes you. If you treat her like an adult toddler who just can't help being sort of obnoxious and overbearing and over excited and gently but firmly correct her every time or just walk away then it won't really get your goat so badly.

It's when you put the expectation of a fully grown adult person on her that you'll be disappointed. Just remember always that she's kind of a loud social ditz and treat accordingly "

105	dkzvwvl	dkzx42q	FORTnITE	"We sort of discussed this below. For visibility, here is my breakdown, fleshed out for all tiers:

**A Tier** Great single target damage and group dps increase.

* Urban Assault - consistent, high dps across a range of weapons due to increased reload speed, (40%), rate of fire while head shotting (50%), and kneecapper. A non-upgraded goin' commando and frag grenade help with basic wave clear. If provided war cry, this soldier is a dps monster. Stack with special forces or warlord.

* Special Forces - good sustained damage with assault rifles (24% extra damage and 40% reload). Great individual wave clear with grenades, fast cooldown, boosted war cry, and going commando. War cry and commando can be used in combination for extreme wave clear, including obliterating mist monsters. Also, 60s war cry with 15s duration works well with a coordinated team. A crit based Ranger, Commando, Urban Assault, or another Special Forces really work well in a group.

**B Tier** Requires team coordination or support to excel

* Warlord - powerful war cry with larger radius to pick up a spread out team. Powerful goin' commando which can be stacked with said war cry for wave clear or mist monsters.

* Commando - Powerful goin' commando and kneecapper. Needs to be paired with another soldier who offers war cry to truly be effective. Dps monster when given war cry. 6 grenades to work with in between goin' commando usage.

**C Tier** Lack either single target DPS or consistent wave clear

* Support Specialist - Only if you have access to a good explosive weapon, otherwise D tier due to no reload, rate of fire, or damage perks. No durability loss during warcry, stacked with a good rocket launcher or grenade launcher, is quite powerful in a pinch.

* Centurion - Overvalued by many due to kneecapper. Decent team support but without said team focusing on all hard targets, which a lot of the time isn't viable, she simply doesn't offer much.

* Master Grenadier - Inconsistent DPS due to dependency on grenades, without a cooldown for their regen. No weapon damage perks or other dps aside from a base goin' commando.

**D Tier** Trade damage for defense

* Shock Trooper - Shock wave is only useful in specific scenarios and lacks DPS compared to the top tier soldiers. I don't want gimmicks in a soldier skill set, I want optimal dps and wave clear.

* Survivalist

* Rescue Trooper"	Awesome thanks. Do rare heroes get access to kneecapped or is it only the epic/legendary version?

115	czj3aji	czjddcc	MakingaMurderer	"> I know that they were all working together on the first Avery conviction

But you are wrong, because neither Lenk nor Colborn were working for MCSD during the first case. Colborn didn't join MCSD til 1996. Lenk joined in 1988.

Colborn transferred the phone call, which did not mention the names Allen or Avery, or the specific crime, to a detective. This is what his deposition was about. 

"	"Watch episode 2 again. An ADA named Jones gave a deposition about a phone conversation he had with Kusche that they were all lying. That they all knew exactly who the call was about in 95 and sat on it. Kusche didn't deny it. Colborn wrote his report the day after Avery got out because he knew the person from Brown county could expose him anytime if he had written down notes on his end. 

MCSD was so screwed if nothing had gotten in the way of that lawsuit. Do you really think Steven Avery is the only person who got unfair treatment? Every person those officers and Vogel help arrest or convict were about to have serious grounds to have their cases  looked at. That's not even bringing potential financial ruin into the equation. 

All they had to do was stay away from the investigation, that's it. They couldn't, why? Because they were going to make sure the conviction stuck this time.

Apparently Dutch CSRs start with one of two things: ""don't blame *me* for [broken item, billing error on the power bill]"" or ""yeah... what do you want *me* to do about it?""  

And although they like that the Dutch healthcare system is actually affordable, it's kind of... strange to navigate. My male friend broke his arm playing baseball.

Have you tried LM and becca on each side of your face in Sephora and then looked at yourself in different lighting? I think you're the only one who can make the final decision esp as to whether the highlighter lasts on you after wearing it around! 

I'm going to have to recommend becca champagne pop because it surprisingly is very easily sheered out. I get a seriously natural glow with a stippling brush and it lasts. And obviously it can be crazy or medium or slight glow if you want it to. I did worry as to whether it had microglitter but it doesn't show at all on my face and I'm really particular about not being glittery, just very naturally slightly glowy. 

Kevyn Aucoin also has Candlelight samples available for I think $15 on ebay, I was definitely tempted since I doubt I can finish a highlighter sample.

Now, as for which Parks, I'm fairly well versed in East-End parks &amp; can give some tips if you have questions on specific parks. Glen Stewart, like a lot of Toronto green space, is a ravine. Specifically, it's a lovely series of walking paths through a heavily forrested ravine. 

There's not a lot of space for you to have a ceremony that wouldn't be in a walking path &amp; if the weather's nice, it will be a trafficked, though not crazy busy, path.

Now, the ravine aspect. The spring means a lot of the ravine green spaces are quite wet. While this could make them less trafficked, there is a reason.

I'll think on it &amp; see if I can come up with a good suggestion. In the meantime​, I would suggest browsing the city's park website, it is a good resource. If you think you find a good match, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

142	dgydf5i	dgysopy	WTF	"This happened to me and family+friends during the 2004 tsunami. 

Me, wife, two friends and one set of our parents. All in an eight seat Toyota. West coast of Sri Lanka. I was the first to spot the waves coming over the breakwater rocks. Ten seconds later, the driver has stopped the car, gotten out and doesn't get back in in time. The water rises, quickly and starts moving the car. It is too late to open the doors. We roll windows down, and just watch the slow-mo ride that takes us three hundred feet to a half-built building. Three of us get out through windows, get on the roof of the car and literally walk across to the roof of the building. We still have three people trapped inside with no way to get out. 

Ten seconds later, the wave subsides a bit, and the car drops back to ground level. Everyone gets out. 

It is a mad scene. People in shock, except for random, occasional wailing. Wife tries to resuscitate an old lady, without luck. We try to help motorists get their cars off the train track, except that there is absolutely zero chance a train is coming down that line in the next two years. Finally, we get a call from a friend who warns us about subsequent waves. We all book it up a hill nearby. Lucky to have everyone survive. Luckier than a lot of families nearby. 

This shit happens fast- too fast for untrained people to react. If you get out of the car, count yourself lucky. If your car doesn't catch something underwater and roll over, lucky again.

Sorry this is so short and simple, but he has simple tastes, and isn't very clever."
