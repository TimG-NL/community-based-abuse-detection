1	czj5kvr	czj6wgw	BabyBumps	When I was breastfeeding I'd lose a lot of weight so I'd be about 120 with some variation of G/GG etc boobs (different by brand and I was bigger with each kid) and I felt like a diminutive boob life support system. We shall not speak of finding clothes that fit that shape.	Yeah, finding a shirt that fits giant boobs and then a tiny everything else made me look like I was wearing a tent.

It's a generic term for greens. So you can have palak saag (Spinach leaves) or Sarson Ka saag ( Mustard leaves), method Ka saag (fenugreek leaves) etc.

Its her fault Shmi was raped to death by Tuskans, causing Anakin's mind to shatter and take his first real steps in to the Dark Side.  

Good job Padme!"	"I cant believe that shmi was being raped by the tuskans.

That's some insane implication by lucas wtf."
9	dgybuvx	dgyviir	Mcat	"To offer a different perspective, i strongly disagree with this poster. I've routinely seen individuals with no major scientific background, including humanities and engineering students score extremely high. Engineering students would have some familiarity with MCAT physics and chemistry, but that's it. As a matter of fact, a significant % of the highest scorers in our schools MCAT club is encompassed by the aforementioned cohort.

At the end of the day, how you score relies almost exclusively on your critical thinking capabilities and mental processing speed."	It's great to have differing view points on this and I feel a little more confident after reading your comment. Do you think the Kaplan review books would suffice to cover basic content knowledge?

"Combine what he's shown of his personality his ""the only thing that matters is being good at Arcana Heart"" with the fact that his social media is dedicated entirely to that then it paints the picture that the only thing that matters to him is Arcana Heart "

21	dgyp4ym	dgyws4m	BattleRite	There is still sustain in his M2, just on the round 3 battlerites instead. Wasn't it always from a battlerite? Because I'm missing something if it used to be baseline.	"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."
22		czj9shy	WeAreTheMusicMakers		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "

36	czjfwpb	czjg6h4	AskReddit	It's not a rational thing at all, that's just how my brain reacts. Just like how there's no reason I find short women attractive, it's just how I'm wired.	There is definitely nothing wrong with feeling that way. You are genetically attracted to people with different features.

There is literally nothing I--or any other woman--could do according to your belief that would convince you that they are anything other than brainwashed and that makes your stance inarguable and, ultimately, screwed up because it just puts you in a place where you are telling women what to like or think--the same as how things are now. You're not progressive; you're just patronizing and controlling. "	"You're free to sexually fetishize yourself being murdered, if that's what you're worried about. But it doesn't make it healthy or right. 

I'm sorry you're angry, but what does it matter what I, a woman who has seen many more years, think about you? For the record you seem like an incredibly bright person who has great potential to do some real good in this world. So then, what is missing? Why do you feel the need to come in this space seeking validation for lifestyles and ideals that we've already personally experienced and/or extensively studied before you were even born?

No one is immune to conditioning. I think as time goes on, and especially if you decide to read more widely and extensively, you'll become more cognizant of this fact."

Cool. Both of those look great (I own a HyRoad, and have considered adding a DD to my setup also), so no objection there. Opens the path to dropping the !QTF also.

Given that you have a mostly Storm/RG bag (and more importantly a Dare Devil already), I'd lean towards the DDTrick (bigger cover, same core) for that reason. GB2 should be similar just a board or two less overall hook vs the DDTrick.

> And if I decide I want to bowl more tournaments I should pick up a monster hook ball.

Agreed.

> Can you also recommend an Asym monster to pick up?

The Mako and Sure Lock are pretty much leading the field right now for the asym hook monster slot. The new No Rules Exist from RG could also be good, but haven't seen enough from that ball to have as strong of an opinion on it. I personally have a Sure Lock for that slot and love it."	Just to butt in, Sure Lock then ball down to DDT seems like a great combo, granted I've had the DDT for just a week.
62	dkz2oay	dkzubj6	TheMassive	"Ok, so I keep seeing this sentiment (in this thread and others) that being annoyed with our current standing and our performance this year is silly and foolish.

Can someone tell me how fighting for a playoff spot over midway through the season in Berhalters highest PPG year ever is a good thing? No?

So can we stop acting like thats a good thing? The sky's not falling. Its also not raining Supporter's Shields and MLS Cups, and its ok to want that. Stop insulting and putting down fans who are frustrated with mediocrity when this season is exactly that. People see teams like Chicago and TFC who have been historically terrible at the top of the table, and they want the Crew to be there. But fuck them right?

I don't want to hear about point totals unless you can look me in the eye and tell me that 6th in the east (out of 11 teams, so right in the middle) is a *good* team and we should be happy to be in this position. Wanting an above average team instead of average ISN'T A BAD THING, so stop treating fans who want and expect that like they're bad fans."	This. 👏

Transportation planning is a well, planning problem. Its a different field. He has no idea what is going on in that world. Speeding up a tunnel digging machine? Fantastic, that's an engineering issue and I hope he makes improvements. But turning that, into what is shown in the video does not follow. 

This is also true of the Hyperloop. Can he be the person to turn his sketch into technology? Absolutely. Will that invention solve a transportation problem? Not likely in the real world due to many constraints he has no understanding of. "

"Not delicate, really. My job is a lot of banging on shit until it comes loose, it's the troubleshooting that would be the hard part. Someone has to program the automated process. That someone can't think of every possible situation.

I have Mediacom. 100 mb down 20 mb up. 

There are only two (actually 3 isp's) here in the Desert. Two that matter (Mediacom and Verizon) the third is a local isp, but speeds are not their strong suit. 

I have the fastest consumer grade connection available. For 70 bucks, it's not bad. 

My ping issues are from having 3 roku's  in the house, which are always on, plus phones, laptops, tablets, etc... 

My pc is hard lined, everything else is wifi. Which, I turn off when my roommate is out. So the roku's, and everything aren't interfering whilst I play. 

But, Mediacom will not dual connect us, and Verizon does not connect on my side of town. So, I pay for everyone else to use my friggin Internet. Which sucks.

134	czj5n6e	czj6hwp	AnimeFigures	Aye it is and their statues are really great, speaking of which, have you seen the Naruto and Sasuke statues for Naruto Storm 4 that Tsume made in collaboration with Bandai Namco? Gecco has 1 exclusive Naruto figurine which is when he puts on Minato's Hokage coat from Road to Ninja, the other one comes with interchangeable parts for 3 different poses and they are supposedly making Kakashi next with interchangeable parts as well :) are you hunting down all the Tsume Xtra's or just getting Obito and Itachi?	Yes! I saw it. Pricing is a little steep, but I'm keeping my eye out. I'm slowly collecting the Tsume XTras one by one. I have Orochimaru preordered. 
135		dgyv4as	worldwonders		"In March 1958, a B-47 bomber took off from Hunter Air Force Base near Savannah, Georgia destined for the UK to take part in a training exercise. While in flight a warning light indicated that the bomb, called an Mk 6, wasn’t secured properly so a crewmen went to check on it. While he was inspecting he accidentally grabbed the release hatch lever instead of a hand-grip to pull himself up. This sent the 8,500-lb. device crashing into the bomb bay doors, forcing them open and plummeting the bomb 15,000 feet below. Fortunately, the nuclear head for the bomb was in a separate location and the bomb was not armed. The bomb detonated on impact, leaving a 75-foot across, 35-foot-deep crater. It destroyed the home and property of the Gregg family of Mars Bluff, South Carolina. The family of six was injured but there was no reported fatalities.

141	dkzr9pg	dkzrdni	BravoRealHousewives	[verwijderd]	That's what I've read. She didn't resign and/or Bravo didn't decide to bring her back until way after filming had already begun, so that's why she isn't involved in any of the group scenes so far.

If anything, maybe you could have added more shading with the orange or darker yellow, you did a bit but copics looks so great when they are layered up."
143	czjdr86	czje7vw	OutreachHPG	I like to think of him as the grizzled vet who has been playing since closed beta, but can't seem to get out of tier 4.	I don't recall fighting any really scary Atlai recently...
144	dkzm9by	dkzsd5p	Ubiquiti	On this product - is the speaker good enough quality that you'd want to stream with it anyways? 	No it's not.

"	"In order to reduce traffic we would have to ban job density, or at least insure that jobs are not allowed to grow in excess of residences.

Banning residential density doesn't reduce traffic when jobs are allowed to grow faster."
