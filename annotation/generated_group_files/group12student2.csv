47	czgtqcs	czjdqfx	DaystromInstitute	People are not answering the question I posed. I will clarify. When Sisko retook DS9, Dukat was in Federation custody now had the war ended at that point or shortly there after would the other parties convene a trial for Dukat using him as a bargaining chip to force the Dominion to surrender.  Sisko, Martok and Senator Velal could force concessions onto the Dominion by holding a public trial of Cardassia's former leader. My question is not about the outcome of the war rather it is about the methods open to the Alliance in prosecuting the war.      	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sh#t about the Cardassians time and time again.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."

""I think it would be cool if it turned out that there is a real person inside of Stalker's warframe.
He undergone some kind of surgery to build a warframe around his body and when he found out that other warframes are just remotely operated by children he went insane, cause he's stuck with this infested suit forever.
(Maybe he was tricked to do so ? Or maybe it was just some kind prototype method to build warframes and required a host ? He sacrificed his life and body and later it turned out that a bunch of little sissy ass teenagers can operate warframes with ease ?)"""	"Well, it still hasn't been revealed what's in our Warframes, no? We know that they're remotely controlled, but they also seem to be able to act independently, as evidenced by the end of the second dream quest.

According to the [wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Warframe) warframes were, at one point, referred to as ""exo-armor"" (although that seems to have been removed now), meaning that there is indeed something inside the suit, that needs protecting. Could very well be that all warframes are a combination of Orokin soldier stuck inside the frame and Tenno operator controlling it. Which could potentially make the Stalker a 'frame that gained independence from its operator. 

If it's indeed an Orokin Soldier/Tenno Operator combination that would also explain why the Stalker, who'd be one of such soldiers, is hell-bent on avenging the fallen Orokin empire. He watched the Tenno destroy the Empire, unable to do anything against it, because his own Operator kept him under control - and now he wants revenge.

94		dkzwymu	The_Donald		Rodayo clowns
95		czjasp2	NUFC		"Stoke 

what the fuck"
96		dkzs3f9	BigBrother		"Paul saved the word ""friendship"" last season from the taint of s6 and this season he has brought it back down into that cesspool"
97	czje4a8	czjet6u	SandersForPresident	"As an HRC supporter... a lot of people don't realize that she's got VERY similar views to Sanders, they share a LOT in common. Their major differences are that Sanders takes a revolutionary approach and thus goes miles further. Hillary is an incrementalist, for better for for worse. I'm a fan of the ""chip away slowly"" strategy, but I give Sanders credit where it's due :)"	The problem is people don't know which policies they're actually supporting with Hillary. 
98	dkxxyfr	dkzyfgw	Frat	"Armani acqua di Gio.

Or just pour a couple of beers over your hair. Girls go wild for that beer scent."	I've been between that and mont blanc. My other colognes never get used 
99		dgz07a0	buddythunderstruck		I have official run out of ideas to write about, and have thus began meme production. What am I doing with my life? I mean, this isn't even dank!
100	dgyxyur	dgyy3tc	EdmontonOilers	Lol you're telling me [this](https://www.nhl.com/video/silfverbergs-second-of-the-game/t-289075706/c-51773903) goal was Talbot's fault? Aside from the 4th goal none of them were his fault. And if you're going to tell me Talbot is the reason we went 4 down you weren't watching the game. The type of chances Anaheim were getting they would have scored vs LB eventually.	"That 5th goal, if Talbot was playing like he normally does, he would of had. He saw the puck, but didnt hustle enough to get over. He 9/10 times stops that puck.

The idea behind pulling the goalie isnt only because the goalie is having a bad game. He allowed 3 goals on the first 5 shots no matter how you slice it. You pull the goalie to send a message to the team. It was clearly not his night, as depicted by the game winner and the 2 that followed. Talbots one of my favorite players, but he was bad tonight."
101	czjb1l0	czjbmlt	AdviceAnimals	Do you not think that overpopulation is a problem, at both the national and world levels?	Oh yes, definitely. But we won't hit that issue for hundreds if not thousands of years. I mean Macau has the highest population density in the world and is gorgeous. The world will just turn into one big giant city and then just build up. Currently the USA has a VERY low population density so it really is not an issue.
102	dgyv99r	dgyvd5j	Persona5	You need to hang out with them. Also having a matching Arcana Persona improves how quickly you can progress the confidant level. You don't need matching Arcana's for Sun and Moon.	but my question was that if hanging with them even having that text was worth it to get the next rank in Arcana.
103		dkzomjr	INJUSTICE		Not really necessary, sort of defeats the purpose of the multiverse 
104	dgysuup	dgysxn3	SquaredCircle	Odds had Jericho winning, my dude. 	Oops I'm sorry I made a mistake 
105		dkzudlp	healthnet		[removed]
106	dkzo7p3	dkzojum	CanadaPolitics	Is Watts further right? She is pretty good on the environment and transit at least.	She is a federal Conservative and I believe the other two are Liberals. That said there are a few further right than Watts I hope don't end up running. I heard a James Moore rumour as well.
107	dkzrbuf	dkzs5ib	Cubers	Oh, I did it slightly differently. I paired all the edges then inserted them like they are meant to be. In other words the First 3 Layers were solved completely. Like F2L with a 3x3. Was I not supposed to do that?	You can't have paired all of the edges, since several of the yellow edges are paired incorrectly.
108		dkzrhgf	EASportsUFC		NotaMathmatician beats Dusty_Wizard280 by 5 round mauling into a knockout. Who is my next victim u/Allzo7
109	czjackv	czjbawc	AdviceAnimals	It isn't an urban myth, it just takes more than a few chocolate bars to actually cause damage.	"The whole ""die in a fire"" response though?  Someone's got issues"
110		dgyvl7x	FULLCOMMUNISM		Lol that's the most liberal bullshit I have ever heard of haha.
111	dgyw7up	dgywi2t	Catholicism	I don't actually believe that you were confused about this.	Ok
112		dgyrzjn	BattleRite		Hell yeah! Thanks for the feature!
113	dkzmo4c	dkzo5la	Browns	Line up in 2-2-1, then have Duke go wide out	"A CB on duke is not a match up in our favor. 

You really think crow and duke is much of a running formation?  Maybe in the pre 1970s.  Now they will play a big nickel on you. You will have a SS flying into duke on runs. How long will he last taking those hits? 


The patriots noticed the best coverage people on the defense were corners. They took advantage of that by playing 2 TEs or a strong slot wr as the 3rd wr.  The best 2 defenders were on the wide outs.  

By going 2-2, you are basically freeing up one of the better coverage defenders to take away you second best receiver which could be duke or Njoku. Crow basically is a blocker or dump off on pass plays. On runs, you at a disadvantage.  The defense will be playing pass and not afraid of the run because they know a LB or Safety can beat the block by the other RB. Crow doesn't block blitzes very well as it is. Thinking he will lead duke on runs is optimistic. 

Look, I'm not saying we can't go 2-2 a few plays a game. But that is not something you should be a major part of the offense. 

"
114		czj7qaw	OrlandoMagic		One thing I've learnt from this match is that winning is better than losing.
115		dgyxpvk	RocketLeagueExchange		JK i lied sorry do not have
116	czj9w57	czjab89	Silverbugs	Awesome! :) BPM gave a lot of us a hell of a deal!	"And I am very grateful to be one of the lucky ones, but what happened to all the great BPM deals? I haven't seen anything earth shattering since the 1oz monkeys. 

Edit: I don't think this premium is anything new. I bought 1 for a buddy of mine for $27.09 on DEC 9 from JMB."
117	dkzqkqq	dkzr1kb	MMA	Good point but what about Cyborg vs CM Punk? 	Can Cyborg shoot a double leg? If so gameover 
118		dgywkpf	d230		Second
119		dgyw3as	Overwatch		I'll play 
120	cziz7i1	czjfw0q	TrollYChromosome	"us scandinavians ARE known for our trolls
"	"We have a Scandinavian shoppe near where I live that I'm convinced is a ""front"" for something. Mostly because I'm convinced the police would be too freaked out by all the trolls just...staring at them from **everywhere** to investigate the place.

^^^They ^^^definitely ^^^aren't ^^^a ^^^front, ^^^but ^^^walking ^^^into ^^^a ^^^store ^^^filled ^^^with ^^^faces ^^^spooks ^^^me ^^^&gt;&gt;"
121	cziluqf	czj6svb	SquaredCircle	eh. You can never tell. I'm sure Billy knows who to call about it - I just don't think him being a musician holds any sway over that. It's definitely a part of how Grado got over though. The smart money would be to find something *really* dated and cheesy that licences for much less - something like Tubthumping by Chumbawumba for example - and make that his thing.	"""Two of Hearts"" by Stacey Q, too.

(Just realized this'll be the second notification you'll get from me next time you log on. I promise I'm not stalking you, good sport.)"
122	dkzsbdo	dkzsgca	amiiboSwap	"NIB Luigi and Ryu?

Edit: both NIB 1p

Edit: Sorry I was looking at my list"	No thank you, I can still get 1st Print Ryu around my area. Also, I post a picture of the CP Isabelle Card to show prove I have it.
123		dgz06ax	UniversityOfHouston		She can park in the welcome center garage or the stadium garage. Both have adequate visitor parking. There's also meter parking around campus but I noticed that gets busy after 9AM. 
124		dkzokap	TaliyahMains		Taliyah is much stronger than ahri and lux, but not because of her damage. She is strong because of how strong her ultimate is if used correctly, how deadly your full combo is if you can hit it, and how good she is at kiting. 
125	dkzkl75	dkzwaai	NatureIsFuckingLit	[verwijderd]	They also grow to be 400+ years old
126		dgz1dj7	Pareidolia		Who took a bite of of one and put it back? The bastard. 
127	dgyyeg0	dgyyi50	SiliconValleyHBO	Just realized Gavin acquired Piper Chat explicitly so that he could get Barker's chat logs. 	Didn't catch that, that's great
128		czjcsxu	Biochemistry		Depends on the assay. By them selves, hoagie assays aren't necessarily more sensitive. It's the grinder assays magnification of response that yields increases in sensitivity. Like the western blot. One antibody bind an epitope, another antibody bind s that which is conjugated to an enzyme which produces 1000s of activated light emitting molecules. So approx. 1000 x amplification in signal. PBJ assays can, but don't have to, similarly amplify signals.
129	czj5fg3	czj8rm9	PercyJacksonRP	"""And...?"" "	"""And he doesn't know how to talk to her, so we've been working on it."""
130	czj9xor	czjabis	CFB	"check your numbers. per 247:

OSU - 26, 31, 29, 26 = 112

FSU - 20, 29, 22, 19 = 90

that's an entire extra recruiting class that OSU processed "	Those numbers include LOTS of walkons for OSU for some reason. Look for the guys with no stars.
131		dkznoys	LitecoinMarkets		Any where to watch Charlie on CNBC asia online? should be on in an hour right?
132	czitpd6	czjcoif	TwoXChromosomes	Seriously, what the actual fuck. Does this really exist?	In the great state of Arizona any dr can withold information they believe could lead you to terminate your pregnancy. Those fancy tests to detect  fetal defects are only as useful as the spirituality of the person reading them.

134	dgytzss	dgyu4am	CoDCompetitive	"Because you brought it up LOL. You think you're sick because you have people PM'ing you telling you I'm stupid.

That's like, as pathetic as it gets. Talking shit behind people's backs on fucking Reddit. 

Lmao adios buddy, hope you graduate from Reddit someday and realize upvotes and PM's don't mean shit.

I got 3 upvotes on my comment to yours earlier btw, does that mean I'm better than you at Reddit? Ahahahahah."	how do I think im sick tf lmao. I was just stating that people agree that you're an idiot. I was gonna @ you but i didnt know how to exactly spell your name. I should've just @ dumbass tho.
135	dgysq0s	dgyuvb5	Torontobluejays	Hahah what a [classic call by Buck](http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/04/30/1338802883/1493582355280/asset_1800K.mp4). To be fair though that cut buy Jose looks like a no doubter.	"Eh, I was on the 3B line and it seemed a bit low to make it out, I was on my feet willing it up with my screams but  not a no-doubter, but it was definitely the best drive that day.

The bat-flip, now *that* was a no-doubter. I can still see that one soar across the field..."

137		dkzxfjc	CasualConversation		Constantly! I'm 26, but people always think that I'm 21-23. I love the reaction I get when I tell people my age.
138		dgz0lde	FrankOcean		Facts 
139		czjc7ag	AdviceAnimals		I can't even.
140		czjdeex	InternetIsBeautiful		"Not sure why I assumed this would be a timeline of when they flip-flopped. 

This is still really cool. "

they actually have integrity, you only have to visit both to see the vast difference in quality "	As far as I'm concerned echo chambers don't have integrity period, right or left. Claiming one is slightly better than the other is like saying dog shit is a slightly better flavor than donkey shit.
147	dgxzhxw	dgywekt	GolfGTI	Congrats! It isn't often you hear about a deal on an R. I thought they were pretty much MSRP. 	my father almost got a R over his 15 GTI. it had some weird options and had been on the lot for quite some time. i think they offered it to him and GTI sticker price. He said if it had a sun roof he would have gotten it.
