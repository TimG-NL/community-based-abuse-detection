47	czgtqcs	czjdqfx	DaystromInstitute	People are not answering the question I posed. I will clarify. When Sisko retook DS9, Dukat was in Federation custody now had the war ended at that point or shortly there after would the other parties convene a trial for Dukat using him as a bargaining chip to force the Dominion to surrender.  Sisko, Martok and Senator Velal could force concessions onto the Dominion by holding a public trial of Cardassia's former leader. My question is not about the outcome of the war rather it is about the methods open to the Alliance in prosecuting the war.      	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sh#t about the Cardassians time and time again.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."

54	dkznx5i	dkzolsa	AO3	">You can send yourself PMs over reddit, but to my knowledge it has the same shortcomings as sending yourself an email.

I *think* the concept can work, though. I'll elaborate with what I'm thinking how it could work (I seriously need to finish doing my python tutorial, lol). So, I think it has something to do with linking the bot to its own reddit username (or email?), and then making it do the 'if this then that' structure: ""if results of programmed daily scan of <search results URL> feature workIDs that don't match yesterday's, PM /u/username with that workID's <title>,<tags> & <summary>.""

The subreddit mentions bot - it scans *all* reddit pages (idk how often) & PMs me whenever my subreddits have been mentioned anywhere elsewhere on Reddit. To set it up, I needed to send it a PM that configured it/subscribed me to it ([here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Sub_Mentions&subject=Action%3A%20Subscribe&message=%7B%0A%0A%22subreddit%22%3A%20%22subreddit_name%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%0A%22karma%22%3A%201%2C%0A%0A%22filter-users%22%3A%20%5B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%22automoderator%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22totesmessenger%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22autotldr%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22user_history_bot%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22imagesofnetwork%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22sneakpeekbot%22%20%20%20%20%0A%0A%5D%2C%0A%0A%22filter-subreddits%22%3A%20%5B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%22spam%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22redditrequest%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22pariscomments%22%0A%0A%5D%0A%0A%7D)). 

I feel like a similar thing could happen here where I'd PM the bot the AO3 search results URL, which basically orders it to scrape that URL once a day for any new workIDs in the CSS (would need extra coding to 'remember/record' the old workIDs, whereas the sub mentions bot doesn't have to remember anything... but if it can be done by a userscript to remember old workIDs, I think a python bot can... or actually I wonder if the bot could *use* the userscript and it just pulls the title-highlighted fics' workIDs-?). 

Once the bot scrapes & gets the new workIDs from that URL, it can basically do something like what FanfictionBot does: uses http://ficsave.xyz/ to pull all the relevant details of the fic with *just* its workID number, and sends them to you in a PM. 

...I wonder if you could have this hypothetical bot actually just interact *with* fanfictionbot. Like, it scrapes for new WorkIDs, then PMs fanfictionbot with formatting that *that* bot needs in order to pull up all the relevant details of the fic -- you just have to PM that bot with this message in the bodytext, and it can handle more than one fic listing per PM: 

    linkao3(WorkIDNumber) 

Fanfictionbot replies back with those details, hypothetical-bot receives them, copies their source, and then sends them to the user that had configured this hypothetical-bot to receive these fics to begin with. 

That ORRRRR I wonder if /u/tusing would be interested in adding a thing to FanfictionBot where, if you send a PM to their bot (fanfictionbot) with a certain formatted title like ""Send To: /u/stophaunting"" then it won't reply back to the *sender* but rather it'll PM /u/stophauntingme the fics' details-?

That way, the hypothetical-bot would grab all the new workerIDs in the search results URL, PM FanfictionBot with the designated subject line ""Send To: /u/StopHauntingMe"" + all the listings (in the form of ""linkao3(workID#)"" and then from *there*, FanfictionBot would create a new message to the user specified in the subject line & send along the fic details to the right user..."	I don't disagree that what you're describing is possible, I just don't understand why you would do it like that. If it's just for you, then email or writing to a file would suffice. If you want to (and can) provide it as a service to potentially hundreds of people, you could write a web server that accepts an arbitrary ao3 query string, sends a request to ao3, parses the HTML, and serialises it as RSS/Atom for the public.

I probably do need to change my formation. I've been playing 433(4) since day one because it worked for me and got me promoted every time but after the last patch, the struggle started. 

I feel like I need a tighter formation to avoid losing so many balls, like 4-1-2-1-2(2) with all CM's instead of wings. I love using wings :/"	"That one, except this year it *is* 4-1-2-1-2 (2). Apparently the wide one wasn't cutting it. 

I like it cause I get good support in the middle, so it's harder to lose the ball. Also, having a CDM really helps me with defending. And occasionally the wider CM's actually play like wingers lol. Not to mention that front trio, they're usually close together so you can do some quick passing to get through the defense, or use them as diversion. They're also deadly in counter attacks.

Edit: BTW that's a pretty stacked team you got there. How many points or coins did it cost you? If you don't mind me asking. "

117	dijy7w3	dkzxnny	NintendoSwitch	This Pokken offers 5 new characters(who where never DLC) in a fighting game that's huge. MarioKart is the one with the DLC characters & no extra tracks & some mostly seen before battle stages. 	"I see MK8D as a few new characters/content, but
BATTLE MODE, a real battle mode. the one single complaint anyone had with MK8 was addressed, and done justice no less. Anyone who put HOURS into any previous battle mode knows that's worth a lot in itself.
Add 1080p and all DLC on cartridge (like what, 30$ worth?) and portability. I thought personally it was worth it. I can EASILY see how others would not, though."

Ideologically pure capitalism would privatize *everything*, and that has the potential to go to hell in a handbasket rather quickly.  Would you rather have a ""socialist"" fire department maintained by the state, or a purely capitalist one that is motivated purely by profit and would be tempted to cut corners to benefit the stakeholders?  Would you rather have Nestle managing the water supply in your area, or a bunch of socialists?

Judging by your spelling, you're likely somewhere that's more socialist than the United States.  You'll have to forgive me, but given the current administration here, I'm a bit cynical of the notion that captains of industry are more inclined to work towards the common good than technocrats.  "
122	dgyzjbl	dgz1twa	HFY	"Don't worry,  the USA is searching intently for any signs of WMDs, oppression, tyrants, dictators, and terrorists.

Consider finding something useful to do with yourself. In the meanwhile, I find you boring. Go jerk off with the other maladroit weirdos. "
128	dkyyxd9	dkzswzh	MMA	"I'm honestly not a Woodley fan. I wanted Maia to submit him Saturdaynight, because I've followed the brazilian's career for much longer.

However, the way Dana and the UFC are treating Tyron Woodley is hard to watch. This is a TRUE champion who has defended his belt thrice, never dodged an opponent, always made weight, and thrashed some ELITE fighters from arguably the most talented division in the game. He deserves the big money fight with GSP.

For Dana to pull the rug out from under him after promising him the fight upon beating Maia...shitty business, and shitty display of character from the UFC boss."	I agree 100% man. And the worst part is everyone is agreeing with him
129	dgyzbdt	dgz1a93	SquaredCircle	"I'm sorry but ""I'm not finished with you!"" and ripping the door off the ambulance and hitting a pile of boxes was hilarious"	Why are you sorry?
130	czj8vts	czjav0o	AskReddit	I tell you what; come back and read his comment after puberty and see if you don't cringe so hard you pull a muscle. The suggestions are sexism to both genders, vast rejections of reality, and frankly I worry about how that kid is going to function in school. 	"Insult me if you want, but please deal with my argument substantively. 

We're also coming at this from different perspectives. You're assuming sexist advice is always bad advice. When colleges and courts and the news don't assume by default that men are rapists waiting to pounce, then advice telling men to avoid being caught with their pants metaphorically or literally down in situations that put them in a bad light, even and especially if they are innocent will be meaningless. Until then, I think it's pretty solid advice.

Besides, if we're talking about rejecting reality, your proposed solution seems to be ""hope things will work out for the best and that no one will screw you over because they maybe won't."" And maybe they really won't. But it won't cost much to prep as if they will and it'll save you if they do. "
131	czjcr00	czjd1t8	RWBY	"No, it wasn't. Cinder's ""it's horrendous"" was sarcastic. Emerald's tone and expression was 100% genuine. Doesn't mean she'll turn, but she wasn't being sarcastic."	Emerald's an anti villain, she may be willing to go along with Cinder's plan but it doesn't mean she takes pleasure in watching hundreds perhaps thousands of innocents die. She's a thief, not a cold blooded murderer.
132	dgyf4jj	dgysbde	SubredditDrama	"""When you pour water on a ball, what does it do? It falls off.""

This guy has to be making this up, there's no way someone can be this stupid."	The first half of that sentence is true.
133	czj6bra	czj6irw	DenverCirclejerk	So realistically she'll get 2-3 inches	Yeah... (  ._.)
134	dkzt6v0	dkztfns	NintendoSwitch	"Now, does it have the EXACT same functionality as the sensor bar?

/s"	No. In fact, the Wii sensor bar has a Pascal chip inside.
135		dkzosuq	SquaredCircle		"""Never hit it on us. Never hit it on us."""
136	dgyru1y	dgys18l	GlobalOffensive	There has been randomness in map vetoes in some tournaments. Never heard any positive feedback about it. I personally don't see why randomness would be any good. If teams want to play Nuke/Train/Inferno most of the time, just let them. I'd rather watch the teams play their best maps, instead of playing maps they're not as good on.	Randomness is good or bad depending on how you look at it I guess.  Bad for the players, but good for the spectators if they're looking for a little more variety in maps watched.  Over the course of a long tournament, watching the same maps played way more than the others can get a bit stale, but maybe that's just me.
137		dkzsfvc	Drugs		Yup. Sometimes I still do them when they test fake though. The last time I got some bunk amphetamine, I still ended up snorting most of it. I just knew it was some cathinone and slowly worked my way up. 
138	dgyxash	dgz15re	SkincareAddiction	Nope. It's oily, I know. So I just put it on before bed. U can put it on in the morning as well. Do this for a few days and you'll see results soon! A friend did this and the kp improved a lot in 2 days. 	Thank you so much!
139		dkzuq8a	AskReddit		Possibly teleportation to a distance. I believe that the fact of working with a wormhole has probably been made honestly. 
140	czish6h	czj4uvf	Smite	"The only thing wrong with Season 2's current tank meta is that some of the tanks have insane amount of damage outputs they should never have had in the first place.

Also, change Hades his ult to work like Pos his whirlpool and with the current setup of Season 3, Hades can be a top tier Support."	You know, i keep bringing this up to my buddies. The problem with tanks was never them being tanky. They're supposed to be. The problem with them is they share base damage values and %scaling with mages, instead of you know, doing less damage because they're tanks. The justification for this is that supports tend to be behind due to xp and leveling. So what's the obvious answer to these problems? nerf base damage values and change how proximity xp/gold is given, thus putting not only supports, but junglers in a better place to teamfight? No, nerf cooldown, nerf armor and health values, and nerf select CC gods while leaving other problematic ones untouched. It just really really confuses me that they'd absolutely destroy their set meta that was so close to being balance outside of a few problem gods, and instead completely destroy the balance of the game to try something that seems to not be working for the most part. Jungle now seems like a lane partner instead of a ganker, supports end up roaming far more often in order to get more xp to stay relevant, and most god options for jungle have been severely reduced to a key few that offer the instant burst of damage needed to kill someone, then quickly return to your lane partner mid. The entire meta so far just seems like incredible backtrack to s1 early s2 which is what we spent all of s2 trying to get away from.

142	dkzoft0	dkzpduh	FreeCompliments	"There's a great quote from Captain Picard that gets turned into a motivational meme a lot around Reddit, but it's definitely applicable here: *""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.""*  

It's rare to have the feeling and knowledge that you didn't make any missteps, that you did everything you could have, when at the end of a relationship. Rarer still is having the person you're splitting from acknowledge that to you; it takes a mature person to accept that something isn't working out, without dumping all of their problems onto the other person in a mad bid to convince themselves that they're not the one at fault. If you feel the same way about her, then it's entirely possible that no one is at fault here. Sometimes personalities just don't click, or for whatever reason people aren't feeling it. It happens, and it really sucks because you're tempted to spend hours, days, and weeks wondering what you did wrong, what could have been done differently. I'm telling you now, having been there myself, don't do that to yourself.  

The best thing you can do is to accept that each of you have your own paths through life to tread, and while yours may not include her as you thought it would, that doesn't make it any less important or meaningful. Take a little time to be single and re-connect with who you are and what you want. What are your most deepest-held beliefs and values? What do you want more than anything out of life? If you take some time and answer these questions with yourself, it will help immensely when you get back out there and look for love again.  

Humans have been meeting compatible partners for millions of years, I have full faith that you can right the ship with a little time to converse with yourself. Just remember to hold who you are very tightly, and while it's important to be flexible on the small stuff in a relationship, don't ever compromise who you are for someone else. Stay strong, keep your chin up, and stay positive. We're all rooting for you here. :)"	Hey man idk if I can give you points for this but this made my night to read. Thanks for posting.

You're so sweet,  thanks a bunch! "	Glad to help! I'm the same way and someone helped me in the beginning too so I'm just paying it forward :)

147	dgytng2	dgyv069	Bass	I love how it sounds, I love how it feels to physically play it.  Playing the bass gives a voice to my creativity; I don't see it as practice, it's just what I do.	That's awesome! I love playing my instrument too. I want to get next level with it though, always trying to go next level! I want to be able to play everything I head in my head and I get closer every day. Lately I find if I hear something (like a little melody or something) I can just start playing it in the right key immediately
148	czjfb25	czjg4nz	PublicFreakout	Why is this video down voted? This is some crazy shit!	I think cause it's a very recent repost. I think.
149	czj8mll	czjf5re	Flipping	"Yup. This is the sticking point with 90% of the newcomers. They just want to know ""What should I be looking for?!?!?"".... they want a list. The answer is ""You should be researching and learning all you can about lots of categories."" but that's no fun."	"or maybe the answer for some should be ""become an expert in one specific category""
