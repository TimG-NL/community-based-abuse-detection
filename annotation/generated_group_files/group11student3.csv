Subaki is also the most viable lance unit you've mentioned, throw Iote's shield on him and he becomes an excellent physical tank on flier emblem team, allowing you to bait enemy archers into positions where your other units can gank them safely.

8		dgyyves	WRX		I didn't price a limited, but the dealers that I visited weren't hesitant to immediately drop the price well below sticker on a base/premium to get me to the OTD price that I asked for. One thing you could do is get an ambassador from /r/Subaru or from various Facebook posts to give you one of the $500 off coupons if your dealer will honor it. If you signed paperwork stating that you will buy the car at a specific price, you're kind of hooked unless you want to lose out on your deposit.

Think about it why pay a human (who might do a bad job) or pay a robot who will do it perfectly, efficiency, and no benefits. Another thing somewhere it said that the minimum wage was to target black people (kinda like blockbusting except this time it's reversed), and get them fired. 
22	dgyu7uw	dgyvza0	AskReddit	He's right. They share something like 89% of the language, so they would technically be classified as dialects. Obviously nobody could understand each other even a little, so that technicality is pretty irrelevant.	"The lexical similarity ends with vocabulary.

25	czj8cc6	czjapbc	Surface	"Honestly people need to stop expecting devices like the SP4 to be high end gaming devices. They're not, nor were they ever, designed to fill that role.

That said there are *literally* hundreds of thousands of fun games that will run perfectly on them. You just aren't going to get the same experience you do from a dedicated gaming PC or laptop.

My advice to gamers who want an SP4 is to find different kinds of games for it than you would expect to play on your gaming rig. Looking at my steam library I can see at least 20 great games that would run perfectly on any model SP4 and that's just what I've got installed.

They're an awesome device for certain things and it's great that they *can* run some games... I just feel like way too many people bought one expecting some kind of mobile gaming beast and are now disappointed. "	"This. Tons of awesome small/indie/older games out there.

54	dkzkg16	dkztj8y	CasualConversation	What's the difference in this case?	"Socialism is a *very* broad idea about social ownership with many different ways for that to be implemented. The nature of which is very compatible with democracies and capitalism. Hence why pretty much every industrialized nation has many elements of socialism. The US is frequently criticized for having fewer social programs than the other OECD nations, particularly for its general lack of a socialized healthcare system (except medicaid, medicare, and the veteran programs).

Communism is more specific and while it has multiple definition itself, it usually involves seizing (not ceasing, haha) the means of production (and ""the means of production"" also varies by definition). Communism tries to outright remove social classes and typically requires a great upheaval of society (although communist thinkers are somewhat divided on whether or not outright revolution is necessary for the transformation into a communist society). And while we're breaking misconceptions, communism doesn't require that every is paid the same or the likes.

In practice, communism has tended to result in dictators. Probably in part because of the common idea that a powerful, small, transitional government would be needed to facilitate the massive upheaval, and that tends to favor someone rising as a dictator. Not to mention the fact that communism appeals to the working class, making it a rallying cry. Socialism, on the other hand, in practice tends to be used mostly by democracies and is a principle tool of modern liberalism, which heavily favours welfare systems, which are a socialistic idea. Perhaps a common area for confusion is how many communist governments have put ""socialist"" somewhere in their name. But they also like to call themselves ""democratic"" and ""republic"", so you really shouldn't put much weight in names!"

58	czizav2	czj9kvn	ModSupport	I originally came to reddit because I was linked to a relatively small subreddit. The day I discovered the frontpage (which actually I didn't discover until I think almost a year of redditing) was the day I unsubscribed from all the defaults (okay to be fair I didn't unsub from *all* the defaults immediately, just most of them, but when I realised how little content was coming through from the subreddits I actually cared about, I unsubbed from those too). 	I was someone who browsed for a while without making an account.

66	czj4tuh	czj5zv8	StarWars	Yes! What is the context of this?	"An ""alternate universe"" take on Return of the Jedi. The premise of the Infinities comics (they did them for ANH, ESB, and ROTJ) is that ""what if"" that one crucial moment didn't play out the way we saw it. In A New Hope, Luke's shot misses and the Death Star isn't destroyed, leading to Leia getting taken and trained by Vader and Palpatine. ESB has Luke dying that night on Hoth, so Leia goes to Dagobah to be trained by Yoda. Jedi has the negotiations with Leia (as Boushh) with Jabba go sideways, and a shootout happens, changing the chain of events. I'd recommend them, they are lots of fun."

Recently we've gotten into a slump; we had surge of inactive players and only three-quarter-filled chests. Now, we have cut off the fat and we are back to getting max chests, active players (during clan battle 4-12 people were on constantly), and provide many incentives! Let's look at that later.

Clan | Leader | Required trophies to join 
:-- | :-- | :-- 
worstname4aclan | W-Quan | 3000
UsoName4aClan | KeyboardWarrior | 0

**Now, what does our main clan provide for you if you join?** 

- Full chests.
- A private tournament at the end of every month(one hosted 3 days ago). Both clans can participate!
- Friendly battles & Clan battles galore. 
- 33k clan trophies with 48 members. Over 30 players has/had been into hog mountain and many are pushing! 
- 16k season donations, so you'll always get what you want.
- Kik Clan chat and Discord Server is made! Kik: #clashroyalerecruitment | Discord Server is recently made so pm me for more details. 
- Diverse age group. Mostly high school teenagers to adults. Occasionally higher or lower. This means there are minimum restrictions on what you can say!
- A feeder clan if you ever make a second account or want your annoying ass little brother who's in barbarian bowl to stay somewhere that's active. 

Yes, like I mentioned above, we have a feeder clan! One of our mates who got to 4k trophies is helping our clan out, and we already got 21 members. If you forgot what's it is called, here's this: UsoName4aClan, or #L8UPPPJ. If you have further questions you can PM me, type up a comment on this thread, or for a faster response hit my kik up @ystherealone. I'll be expecting you. (;

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**THREE RULES FOR OUR CLAN**

- 10 crowns minimum & 1 win required for both clans to stay. 
- Donate at least once in both clans.

I don't really mind losing points to better teams but to them? It just makes me sad because I always question myself what if we won those games +7 points :(

Instead, communication is important, addressing whatever issues come up and moving past them.
It feels like a lot of teams have spent the past year with solving issues by kicking members, and as far as I can remember, very few teams have reached any lasting success by doing so.

As a counterpoint, would you prefer to be violently raped, become pregnant, suffer physical and emotional damage as a result, develop mental illness, and be forced to carry to term a child you don't want and can't support, rather than be falsely accused of rape and found not guilty? You can't compare two situations by using the worst case scenario of one without considering the potential consequences of the other.

If you switch to a custom ROM, you get much better performance in that area, especially on AOSP style ROMs. I'm on Ressurection Remix at the moment, and I can easily keep 6 or more apps pinned in memory. On Sense, I can rarely get more than three at a time to stick.	I've really been wanting to switch to a custom ROM. I still am unsure how to root the T-Mobile version and install one.

OW players will just feel like a burden to the HotS tryhards and HotS tryhards will have a burden. I don't understand why you can't get the rewards in Play v.s. AI the next weeks. Playing a fair game against bots and actually learning the game was way more fun than having 3 nerds constantly being toxic because you had no fucking clue what to do. And blizzard themselves said that 90% of us will just go back to OW after 5 games and they are right. When I played the games, play vs AI felt like something to do when I was bored. Playing quick match was just a nightmare. Nobody will ever stay in HotS. Whatever game mode you force them to play. I'd prefer spending 1000 currency in OW for each skin rather than playing with this bullshit community. Now I know this will lose Karma and get deleted because on reddit, Differing opinions = Offended, and offended -> censorship.
