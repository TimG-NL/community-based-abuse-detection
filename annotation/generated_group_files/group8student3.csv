I would say that people CHOSE to keep me around. I fucked up all my relationships with everybody during my 10 plus year drinking career.

Just to make life more fun, a tip for cloakies, if there is a dictor anywhere near you, do not try to warp, if you do, and he bubbles, you'll stop. Instead, double click in a random direction, cloak, mwd, then change direction by 90 degrees, but not too sharply or you'll stall."	"A small detail to add - there *is* such thing as ""too much speed"" when you're trying to decloak smaller ships, and I'd recommend not overloading your MWD when trying to decloak.

First, a few basics; then, an illustrated explanation:

 * Use the Centered Tracking camera setting to always get a reliable angle on their position when they decloak.

 * Always double-click in space instead of clicking the decloaked target and approaching, because once an object ""no longer exists"" in Eve (destroyed, cloaked, warped off-grid, etc.) your vector of movement gets messed up in most cases.

OK, so:

**1.** [Here you are in your Sabre](http://i.imgur.com/IGaCz0I.jpg), which has its own collision model. The covops also has its own collision model. Your goal is to get within 2000m (global decloak radius) from the *edge* of the pinata's collision model.

**2.** [You start burning at the guy (let's assume meh skills and a nano)](http://i.imgur.com/Btiso70.jpg). The covops will only decloak if *during a given tick* your collision model intersects with their model+decloak radius. In the case of this Sabre, there are two ticks during which you'll get a decloak, so that's good.

**3.** You might be tempted to overload your MWD so you can ohmygodgettohimbeforehegetsoutofmybubble. Thing is, [when you overload your MWD you are basically spreading apart your collision-per-tick spheres farther](http://i.imgur.com/feMKByN.jpg). In this example it doesn't look so bad, because you had a really good vector in the first place. 

**4.** But yeah, don't do that. Why? Well, say that your trajectory is a little bit off. [In fact, here's the closest possible edge case](http://i.imgur.com/jnRRFwa.jpg). Basically you can see that you are actually passing too quickly through the sphere formed by the covops's modelRadius+2000m. For comparison, [here's the exact same vector without your prop overloaded](http://i.imgur.com/0vO9PBL.jpg). The more you increase speed beyond a reasonable number, the more you start counterproductively decreasing your allowable margin of error for your approach vector. Going too fast might even mean drifting out of heated scram range despite getting a successful decloak.

**5.** It seems like a really pedantic point to make when you consider the range of speed of Interdictors, I'll admit. If you need some training wheels for a bit, just drop a second bubble along the way. But keep in mind that it becomes *really* important when you're in something like a fleet ceptor, though, since those are so fast and their model sizes are too small.

----

**Summary:** You want the ""right"" speed for decloaking, not the ""highest speed"": decloaking is tick-based and &gt;3km/s~ you might actually start fucking yourself over. Fleet interceptors may want to attempt to decloak at below max speed.

108	dgytyom	dgz2c7o	PS4	If anyone is concerned that this game is too Souls-like, I just want to say that the game being broken up into missions (instead of open world) makes it much less stressful to play.  It's also a fantastic game.  Sure, it's just as clunky and unresponsive as Dark Souls (which I guess is on purpose), but once you get a feel for it, it is a lot of fun.	Wait what? Since when is dark souls clunky and unresponsive? Unless you're talking about the older games. I don't think Nioh is clunky at all though.

Rank 105, team cost 120

Current Team:Divine Warden U&Y, Duke Vampire Lord, Princess Valkyrie, Enchantress of the Sea, Siren, Lilith

Non IAP

Stopped playing for a while, only checking in to collect stones and occasionally roll. Wondering if there's a better team I can put together/target with what I have now. 
"	"Yes.  Yes there is.  There are, in fact, several better teams you can put together.  Your 120 cost is still going to slow things down until you rank up, but we'll work with what we can.  

1.  Devil team.  You have 2 red sonias, therefore you have a devil team.  Sonia / Sonia / Vampire / [King Baddie](http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=688) / Zuoh / Lilith or Lucifer // friend Beelzebub is a great devil team.  Now, it's way too expensive, so you'd need to rank up a lot.  Tone it down a bit and use Sonia / Vampire / King Baddie /  Big Baddie / Lilith // friend Beelzebub for a 103 cost version that'll get you started.  

2.  Urd is a great fire team leader.  Urd / Cao Cao / Ares / Yamato Takeru / Chiyome is a solid fire TPA team.  100 cost in the current forms you have, so you can run that, too.  Evolve your monsters as your cost increases and you can afford to - Urd first.  

3.  Bastet.  You have a great Bastet setup: Bastet / Vishnu / Meimei / 2 from [Susano (for shield) / Freyja (damage boost) / Meimei2 (more boards) / Vishnu2 (more TPAs).  Pair with Verdandi or Awoken Bastet.  This is actually an endgame-potential team, once you level up, evolve, and awaken everything.  The current iteration is right around 100 cost, depending on which flex subs you take, so it's also affordable.  

4.  Freyja.  She's got a new buddy in Sylvie, so if you can find a Sylvie friend and run them together, she's very powerful.  I'd go Freyja / Michael / Meimei / Bastet / Vishnu // Sylvie friend.  Also affordable for you.  

5.  If you can evolve your DMeta, you can run DMeta / Satsuki / Persephone / Lucifer / dark flex (whatever you can afford, this will be hard given ult DMeta is 70 by herself).  Ultimate Dark Metatron is extremely powerful, so this would be a ""something to work towards"" team.  

Try out those teams, get a feel for them, and see what you end up enjoying most.  It's good to work on a few teams, since sometimes one breezes through where another gets stopped, but you really have a lot to work with.  "

117	czj1qaw	czj8swf	OSU	I really like Haverfield. The quads have enough room if you keep it neat. You probably won't be getting exactly what you want in the new dorms as a freshman though. I put only new dorms as my preference coming in freshman year, and I was placed on south campus as a result (which, as an engineering major, made for a long commute to all of my classes). Now I live in Haverfield, and it's a great location for all of my classes.	Anyway as a frosh I can get north campus quad?
118	cziqk41	czjbzf8	AskReddit	"Nobody on the receiving end of this views it as dominant.

Most (depending on culture) are trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with you.

I cannot stand when men do this shit on dates."	"You mind explaining that? What's creepy, or makes you uncomfortable, about people looking you in the eye the whole time you're talking (not head forward, eyes wide, no-blinking stare)? If I'm looking at other things than the person who is talking, it's because I'm not really interested in anything their saying. If I am, I look them in the eye because it's easier to understand what they are trying to get across, whether that be the words themselves or the subtext that they aren't specifically saying. 

What do you prefer? A person that looks you in the eye for 2 seconds, then looks away, then back again? To me that's rude and shows a lack of confidence. Unless it's a cultural thing"

122	dkzi9x2	dkzsay2	MMA	I like how people are pretending Rumble sucks in this thread based off of his last fight. Look at what Rumble did to everyone he fought except for Cormier at 205. /r/mma's boy Gus got demolished by Rumble and Gus looked like a world-beater against Teixeira. 	Rumble clearly isn't fully motivated in MMA anymore. Rumble just wants Dana to offer him $500k to get in the Octagon with Jon, throw a flurry, get taken down and then submitted.

131		dgz1v7j	PlanetDolan		I had just gotten up for school and I had about 10 minute until I had to got to the bus. My little brother was addicted to coffee to the point where he would drink our creamer. We caught him drinking it and took it away, so he started raging and screaming and he was so mad he his his head on our coffee pot and broke it. He layer down on the ground and just stared at the ceiling, after some time he just fell asleep and I had missed my bus so my mom did the same thing.

145	dgyuvyu	dgyv679	SkincareAddiction	Hi can you tell me what product exactly do you mean by oil cleansing? I use Stridex currently and it does reduce SF on my nose, but there's still a good bit. 	"Oil cleansing is exactly what it sounds like-/ instead of a traditional face wash, you use some kind of oil to cleanse your face. [the wiki has lots of useful info on OCM](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) although I have a small disagreement with the How To: you should apply oil to your *dry* face, not wet. Massage the oil gently into your skin, then rinse away. If you are using straight oils you may need to use a damp washcloth to get rid of residue. If you're using a commercial oil cleansing product it probably has emulsifiers in it so the reside will rinse away. 

I myself has used various different oils-- from straight up mineral oil or olive oil to store night oil cleansers. I am currently obsessed with [this Palmer's](http://www.target.com/p/palmers-skin-therapy-cleansing-oil-face-6-5-oz/-/A-49111078?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;amp;CPNG=PLA_Health+Beauty+Shopping&amp;amp;adgroup=SC_Health+Beauty&amp;amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;device=m&amp;amp;location=9003386&amp;amp;gclid=CNf3utXCzdMCFQSHswod2SAI4Q&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) cleanser and have been using it for the last year or so.

Yes, Trump looks like an old arm chair fucked an even older potato and they had a baby in a cheeto factory, but I'm not going to say that. It would be childish.
