He looks amazing when playing in MLS, but besides a few bright moments he looks mostly average when playing in international games so far. I think he doesn't have as much confidence. I really hope he can adapt and become a key player for the US.

5	dkz4mby	dkzobbh	AskReddit	"Not political propaganda, but Rick and Morty brought back szechuan sauce.

Ever since the season premiere of Rick and Morty, people have been repeating szechuan sauce at each other like a pop-culture Freemason handshake. Lo and behold, at the start of the season proper, McDonald's creates a limited release of this obtuse dipping sauce from 1998 most people don't actually remember tasting (if it were really that popular at its release, McDonald's would have made use of it since then). 

People are high-fiving thinking ""we did it"" when McDonald's announces the sauces return (around the same time as the proper season start). This is classical cross promotion at its finest. McDonald's get a PR spike in a demographic it has been spending a lot of money, [and making stupid commercials to court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTxJZyKymA). The premier might as well have been a giant focus group to turn attention their way. If it all had backlash, then it would simply be a gag from a comedy show, but it didn't. 

Rick and Morty advertised for McDonald's, and now we're seeing a very traditional cross promotion and everybody is patting themselves on the back like they made it happen and weren't manipulated the entire way through. "	I totally agree it was an advertisement, but I'd like to counter with this: Who cares? If it was a good part of the overall show and the viewers enjoyed it... Does it really matter? Should we completely avoid using companies just to stop them from potentially advertising?

21	czj6cmy	czja87d	APStudents	From what I heard, Bio is considered harder than Environmental Science, that might be very ignorant, I am not sure, though I rather have Calc instead of Environmental science in Senior Year and have AP Bio as my science.	"You're not ignorant. Bio *is* harder than Envi Sci, that's a fact. Only 5% of people get a 5 on AP Bio. 

Don't waste your time taking AP Envi Sci, stay with AP Lang.

AP Lang and Comp will definitely improve your writing skills, but you need to be willing to put in the work to ace that exam and get your writing up to par. I absolutely loved it last year. Don't worry, it's not creative writing at all. It's a legitimate college composition class, teaching the basics of the English Language and basics of good writing. I entered AP Lang with terrible writing and left it with a 5, so I am living proof of its powers, haha. It also helps with writing on other tests like the SAT and ACT.

You will come out of that class wishing you were back in it."

But if you think a pair of shoes will help you lose weight, then you deserve to lose the 80 bucks you spent on those shoes, because it's pretty  common  knowledge that there is no magic weight loss thing..

But you shouldn't need a healer in dungeons, fractals and open world content as in those game types, if everyone knows what they are doing (dodge at the right time, perform the right combos, use their self healing skills) then you don't really need a healer. But if you are running dungeons/fractals with people that are not very skilled at the game, a healer can really help to carry those people. 

So in conclusion, only raids need tanks and healers. As for the other content in the game, you shouldn't need those roles, but very low skilled players might make use of it."	To be fair, druids at high level fractals can be very nice. Not necessary, but very, very convenient.

37	dgyoq2c	dgyrwj1	pie	OP, can I get a recipe? I've tried the two in my Pie Town, NM cookbook but they both turned out too dry	"Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)"

2. when making a healer team, how should i prioritize the different forms of healer skills? i'm guessing that skills that can trigger every x notes are better than skills that can trigger every x seconds, and that skills that can trigger from an x combo are better than skills that can trigger from x perfects, but i'm not sure how to compare skills from the first two to skills from the second two. also, how important is actually having high stamina on this team? unfortunately most of my healers only have 3 stamina..."	"Events are actually calculated so that getting the base/free sr takes the same amount of lp.

As far as healers go, I'd avoid the combo and perfect ones, because if you're getting a long combo or a lot of perfects you shouldn't need a healer team :P note-based are usually best, and timer-based isn't too bad unless you're tanking expert.

For health, as long as you have about 30 total you should be fine"
86		czj5bue	SwagBucks		I thought for this one you had to get the + one, the 29.99 one. is that not the case? can you get the 19.95 one (plus S&amp;H) and still get the 3000SB?
87	dkyqe7g	dkzwovv	AskReddit	I answer questions with questions *all the time*. I honestly didn't even notice I did this, until my brother got annoyed that my little nephew picked it up from me. 	I can relate. I play devil's advocate all the time too and it drives people nuts thinking I'm arguing but I just reeeeaally like discussing things and play the other party subconsciously.
88	dkz5j64	dkzvtuc	TheSimpsons	Simpsons Sing the Blues was the first CD I owned. I never knew it came out on vinyl.	Same here!!
89		dkzqysk	LanternMTG		You gotta take a deep breath and just ask yourself the best questions you can. Was I as prepared for the blind meta as I responsibly could have been and what were my mistakes and how do I learn from them? Past that, you can attribute it to variance and you have to take solace in the fact that you literally did the best you could. Unlike the other people on here I do view not making top 8 as unsuccessful. But I also believe that if you can get 9th, you can top 8. And if you can top 8, you can top 4 and if you can top 4 you can take FIRST. Never doubt yourself and your potential. it gets in the way of sick plays.
90	czjfqsx	czjfxac	NoStupidQuestions	But the laws are harsh. Wouldnt that act as a deterrent to people thinkingbof consuming drugs. 	"In most states the laws aren't that harsh for consuming.  Plus your chances of getting caught consuming drugs are practically zero.  Additionally opiate addiction isn't something you ""think about"".
Also in criminal justice in general deterance doesn't work.  "

92	dgyw9yj	dgywizx	Nerf	"I think you have quite a bit of missing and/or wrong information

Adding brass will not substantially increase accuracy in a spring-powered blaster - no matter which one you're using. Accuracy mostly derives from the darts you use. For example, if you use Elite darts fired from two similar blasters (one with brass, one without), accuracy will not change between them, at least not enough to warrant the use of brass at all.

Use accurate darts and your accuracy problems go away. No need to over-complicate with brass, especially in an underpowered blaster like the Recon."	What would you consider accurate darts?
93		czjb59c	DebateFascism		"&gt; Could you elaborate on this point?

There is not much to explain, you say that eugenics can not be effective as many would expect it to be because science simply isn't advanced enough. Once we develop genetics to a certain point your arguments lose their weight.

&gt; I will also point out that certain characteristics are still selected for even in a society where people will die (i.e., fitness, social skill, intelligence, etc.). To say that natural selection is irrelevant simply because people don't die (rather than not having kids) seems to be incorrect to me.

You could be right. I am not *such* a strong advocate of eugenics. In theory it sounds great and I am willing to defend it here, but when it comes to applying it to the real world, it always becomes tricky and it is difficult to determent where to draw the line.

But even so, is there any real reason we shouldn't take baby steps? Doesn't it seem sensible to slowly implement something similar to what /u/KuribayashiTadamichi is advocating and move from there as science advances with enough time between steps to decide which way we should go?

EDIT: spelling."

109		dkzs3l5	OctoberBumpers2017		Oh just tearing my house apart and calling it cleaning. Also buying elastic to fix a cloth diaper. 
110	czj8yd0	czj90ls	CasualConversation	I've dropped my LG G3 a few times and it's just fine. I even dragged it across concrete on accident while biking and it's still fine, not a single hint of damage.	Good to hear - thanks!
111		dgyuiiy	FireEmblemHeroes		"Honestly, since you have already spent so much, might as well go all the way and get a +10. It's worth it. You might get another one with the perfect IVs for a Vantage build (+Atk -Hp). 

Otherwise, take the +Atk -Spd one, with Fury your Ryoma will hit 60atk with the Atk seal and still have a very respectable 38 Spd."
112		dkzqgyg	PersonalFinanceNZ		Yes, but I shouldn't worry about it. It'll only be a problem if you have a history of bad credit. NZ credit checks aren't really like the States. - for the most part they just want to see if you have a history of missing payments more than anything.
113		dgz1d82	GlobalOffensive		It just renders models as wireframe, it's not made for wallhacking or whatever, but for model and level design.
114	dkzqfyj	dkzwc3h	NatureIsFuckingLit	Nemo, don't you touch that boat!	He touched the butt!
115		dgyu7t9	SquaredCircle		Wtf, Cesaro floated like Peach in SMB2
116		czjck88	Fallout		How much would you pay for such a mod?
117		dgz0a37	BabyBumps		"I tried it for about seven babies in my family.
All but one were correct."
118	czjef5u	czjfati	Piracy	[verwijderd]	"Same here, including the switch from utorrent. Zero issues. 
 "
119		dkzpa6o	GlobalOffensiveTrade		"you can go for a good m9 - specialist glove forest ddpat cambo for less then 100 k
"
120		dkzs8gr	OverwatchUniversity		"Sound barrier and transcendence are most often used in the same way: to counter enemy ults.

Most often you will use them to cancel ults from Genji/soldier/Zarya/Phara/reaper etc, and you should hold your ult for when one of these heros uses theirs. A good enemy will wait for your trans/barrier before using their ult. Try not to to get baited into using it until they ult.

Don't forget the delay on sound barrier it can be hard to react to a phara or reaper ult in time, and a (really) good genji can combo you before you can finish the cast. 

If the enemy team doesn't have one of these heroes you can use them to save a valuable team member who is about to die or use them as an engage to help your team push in. You can use trans just for the heal, but only if you get alot out of it, and multiple team members might die if you don't. If your tanks are really low you will get alot of value out of it in terms of healing (but still better used as above).

-----------

With nano, you want to combo with a solider or a Genji mostly but you can also combo it with Phara or reaper. 

Nanoing any of these will allow them to dps though a transcendence or sound barrier e.g. your Zarya gravs and the enemy pops trans, you can nano your Phara and it will kill everybody in the grav but the zen.

If you don't have anybody to combo with you should still use it in every fight (unless it's lost already) as it charges fast, best to use on a good dps, or Winston (it's ok on Dva or a Rien if he is in melee range of their team). You could favor the nano on the Winston over a combo if he's getting 1 shot when he tries to engage. this works well low elo nobody can deal with a nanomonkey.

It's also pretty good with McCree, it will make his ult cast faster and he will be harder to kill while casting, and the dps increase is very good if he can hit his shots."
121	cziuud0	czj663v	PokemonShuffle	[verwijderd]	Because it's a free match 3 game.  It's like getting upset when someone cheats in solitaire.
122	dgyx5de	dgyxvmw	MECoOp	">Considering the loot rewards in ME:A are garbage, sure.

Yeah, they're about the same in ME3, and that was satisfying to plenty of people. If you're not in it for the gear rewards and just want to ""complete"" the game, plenty of people cheat. Many many other people just don't play at all, and play something else for more than the grind."	"I took issue with ME3's loot system too, TBH. It felt massively unrewarding in the final DLC when it became apparent you had to run 10~ games for one rank of a random UR. The only reasons it wasn't as widely hated as ME:A's, I think, were there were many excellent guns in all rarities (so the grind to max everything but UR was extremely rewarding), and the game was just a blast to play. You could play with purely the objective of trying new builds or just popping some heads or playing some space wizards and it was all gravy. This game currently lacks both of those things.

But yeah, never liked this loot system ever. It'd make oh so much more sense if the entire game/mode were free to acquire."
123	czja8hp	czjajqy	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	Nice, that's somewhere between more-than-respectable and fast! 	stopped the speed reading unless i absolutely need to anymore though, last time i did that the migraine got so bad i threw up :(
124	czj0qk0	czj4seh	GoneMild	Good as in you will still be a little naughty?	Ooh goodness, of course not..😉
125		dgyu0iw	LiverpoolFC		Its probably the fact I've been well on the piss all day, but I reckon the reds are going to be sound today. Up the Reds.
126	dkzn4nl	dkzsj1y	Catholicism	"I learned in martial arts class that in real life the right approach is usually to run away.

(I also learned how to take a katana away from someone; but I doubt that is a skill I will be using anytime soon.  Fun, though.)"	Same here, but emphasis on usually. It's entirely different if other people are in danger as well or if you can't get away.
127		dgywybs	TheLeftovers		Fucking brilliant episode. Stuck the landing
128		czjgcbb	Digibro		"1. I think I'd get paid for all 6, as long as you did in fact watch the ad and video all 6 times. I think youtube doens't count views when the person clicks away before a certain point. 

2. I have no idea if there's any rules regarding IPs tho. Youtube doesn't tell us ANYTHING about how we make money through ads, it's all stuff people have figured out largely through conjecture.

3. The ones that appear in the sidebar of the videos themselves I do make money from, but outside of that I have no idea."
129	dkyq4et	dkzp0xu	Barca	Show me a player who gets less money at Barca than where he was before	That's kind of twisting what you initially said. I didn't say they don't get raises. I said not everyone on the team is making MSN money. 
130	dkzs6se	dkzs86f	BigBrother	Okay well Mattress must be broke af because all he cares about is that $8K.	Jessica: he needs a job 
131	czjdgqu	czjdv2w	IsItBullshit	How do I ride a bike?	Well, you need to make sure it is another brown bike.
132		dkzuhs1	Ice_Poseidon		8k by the way
133		dgz23v3	AskReddit		Thanks for nothing, how about some real cash?
134		dkzovdh	Showerthoughts		"Interesting that you use the term ""viewers"" to describe people who listen to songs. "
135		dkzngci	WahoosTipi		[removed]
136	czj85ni	czj8b9s	AskReddit	Many people who are homeless have mental problems or addiction problems.  Giving them that much cash would not work out well. Not only would the addicts squander the money, Criminals and others would prey upon them.  	...Or they would just get an apartment and a nice meal every day.
137	czj0vr8	czjf92j	Watches	If you're looking for rugged might I suggest luminox? Almost unbreakable!  And at your price range. You could get a top of the line one.	"They're all enormous though, won't work at all with 6"" wrists."
138		dkzwdu2	The_Donald		HA!look! the ol limey bastard is back. rinsed penis got gamed
139	czivpsh	czjcyp7	Games	It's funny because the game has plenty of bad game design as well. I love the game, but it might just be a tad overrated.	[removed]
140	dkzobs5	dkzynp1	AskReddit	"""How are you?"" Most people really don't give a shit, so stop asking."	"There was a good Dilbert on this several (many?) years ago (paraphrased):

Person: How are you?

Dogbert:  Do you mean an actual interest in the state of my life and all of it's dramas, tragedies and minor squabbles?  Or do you mean the shallow social idiom?

Person: Uh, I guess I mean the second one.

Dogbert: Fine.  And how are you?

----

I simply have no internal mapping for this social play.  

I answer in some way (""Fine,"" ""getting along,"" etc.), with no appended question.  Yet they don't even notice and answer anyway, ""Doing good, thanks."""

But yes, we should definitely get deranked/losses every time the Ubisoft game/servers fail which is completely not at your fault. That's the logic of Reddit right? According to these down votes I assume that's what the people wants. Seeing as how you guys think, maybe we should get banned for a day every time the Ubisoft servers fail, and you get downranked to bronze. SeemsGood."

You can just plug in the interface and use it, but don't you need to install the manufacturer's ASIO driver or ASIO4ALL? Otherwise you'll be using the  normal Windows audio stack, which has a lot more latency. CoreAudio also has an aggregate audio device feature, which could be useful to some people. The only way to do this on Windows is ASIO4ALL.

Of those 4, only he and Knight Yuri reduce HP to 30%, thus enabling some Desperation passives for certain units/gear (you do lose passives for 50% HP and above, like GE Edna has, but those are easy to use anyway and pack lesser multipliers too).

Also, back in the era pre-Phoenix&amp;Marta of almost no-bash finishers available, he could equip one for those that picked his SA last year (even tho his dmg is low, he could get the job done in the Tower of Trials)."

169	dgyz0si	dgyzwuf	Libertarian	Let me get this straight? you're saying if I write a novel and want to publish it, the publisher is under no obligation to print my name anywhere on it because my thoughts transferred to paper aren't my property? Are you high?	"If you are stupid enough to hand over the manuscript, without signing any agreements, then yes. Albeit they can be sued for fraud, if they sell it under a different name and you have proof that you wrote it.

But if you are a rational person, you will sign an agreement with them, which will specify that they must publish your book under your name and you get a certain percentage of the profits form sales. "

1. Washington, father of the country blah blah.  Also, I hear he had like 30 goddamn dicks.    
1. Adams, Alien and sedition acts, feud with Jefferson  
1. Jefferson, writer of the declaration of independence   
1. Madison, wrote the constitution    
1. Monroe, the last of the founding father presidents   
1. Adams part 2, his son.  Swore his oath on a constitutional law book instead of a bible.   
1. Jackson, trail of tears, beating people with his cane, etc.  
1. Van Buren, The Petticoat affair
1. ""Tippicanoe and Tyler too"", being William Henry Harrison who died only 30 days into his term after giving his inauguration speech in the rain and catching the flu  
1. and his vice president, Tyler, whose grandsons are still alive   

1. Polk (nobody remembers)
1. Taylor (nobody remembers, but he died in office)
1. Fillmore (nobody remembers)
1. Pierce (nobody remembers)

1. Then there's Buchanan, who was almost certainly gay  
1. Then we're into the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln  
1. Andrew Johnson was his VP and took over when he got assassinated, and was impeached but not removed from office  
1. Grant, the civil war general, famous for a horribly corrupt administration
1. Then we've got Hayes, who nobody remembers  
1. Then Garfield, notable for being ~~the first one~~ assassinated
1. His VP, Chester Arthur  
1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers
1. Benjamin Harrison, who nobody remembers
1. Grover Cleveland, the only man with two numbers
1. McKinley, the second assassinated president  
1. Teddy Fucking Roosevelt, trust buster, national parks founder, all around man's man  
1. Taft, mostly famous for being fat and becoming a supreme court justice after being president  
1. Woodrow Wilson, the last president to keep his campaign promises (at least his first term).  President during WWI, had a stroke, and his wife kind of took over.  
1. Harding, the undisputed worst president, until \*ahem\* recently  
1. Silent Cal, his vice president who took over when he died  
1. Hoover, mostly famous for not getting us out of the depression.

1. Eisenhower, the WWII general.  Sent in troops to desegregate schools
1. Kennedy, who slept with Marilyn Monroe and was assassinated  
1. Johnson his VP, who promptly reversed course on Vietnam  
1. Nixon who likely won because Bobby Kennedy was assassinated prior to the election, and of course he resigned in disgrace
1. Ford, who was never elected -- was appointed when Nixon's VP (Agnew) was forced out.  
1. Carter, the peanut farmer, double digit inflation and got the Iran hostages released  
1. Reagan, who took credit for getting the hostages released and played dumb when he got caught doing illegal shit.  He also liked jellybeans  
1. Bush, who famously said no new taxes and then made new taxes  
1. Clinton, who banged an intern and got impeached for lying about it, and set up the conditions for a future economic meltdown  
1. Bush Jr, who created enormous deficits then blamed democrats for deficit spending, also 9/11 and mission accomplished and almost choking to death on a pretzel.
1. Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for not being Bush Jr.  

After that, I forget."	I love your little summaries for each one.

[This is what most of the notes in game look like.](http://loadscreen.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fallout4-2015-11-16-21-09-15-138.png) There's not really a lot of official documents but these notes are common and they mostly look the same, so I suppose he will recognize the style. You could make your note look something like that, and add a Brotherhood of Steel symbol somewhere to make it look more official.

192	dgy6thh	dgytddk	Chinavisa	That's ok, I looked into this and their German passports should work for 144 and 72.	Great.  One other thing to worry about with a TWOV is convincing the cruise line to let you board.  Airlines have deferred keeping track of all the visa rules to [Timatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timatic).  However cruise lines in the past have generally required you to have a visa for all the countries at which your cruise will visit.  This has caused some friction between passengers who don't want to pay for a Chinese visa when a transit should work and the cruise lines who want to keep it simple and require passengers to have a visa.  So you should check with the cruise line to make sure they can board without a visa.

194		dkztcs1	ForeverAlone		I often wonder what women in other states look like. My town is one of the fattest in Texas, so going outside, it's mostly just women with those weird over-hanging beer guts to obese women. When I was spending all week in New Mexico, especially in Roswell, there was a lot of pretty Hispanic girls. I imagine other states only get better.

196		dgyu1ay	MakeupAddiction		I'm very fair with neutral undertones but prefer foundations that are a little yellow over my redness plus I have dry skin so drugstore foundation is pretty much a no go for me too. I do think it's worth it to splurge on a foundation that works for you!  Plus you could waste a lot of money buying foundations that don't work for you so sometimes it's just worth it to buy something you can sample beforehand.

There are four types of people you encounter.  

1. People who like you for the wrong reasons.

2. People who like you for the right reasons.

3. People who dislike you for the wrong reasons.

4. People who dislike you for the right reasons.

Group 4 is the only one you should be concerned about.

I'm cheating, because this is advice I have given to my kids, but middle schoolers are obsesses with all four groups.  Hopefully it'll sink in over time."	"It's perfectly fine for people to have right reasons to dislike you. I'd generalize and say a world where everybody is acting  because of right reasons is a damn fine place. Being concerned about whether people like you is a waste of time. 

People liking you for the wrong reasons are what I would be most concerned about because you never know when they'll realize they're wrong and dislike you. This unpredictable loss of support could be costly in the wrong circumstances. "

221		czjaze9	AskMen		"I go the lecture route. I also think it's a very good idea that you stopped spanking. Everything I have read seems to say its a bad idea, especially long term.

For context I have 2 boys aged 6 and 7. When they mess up my first course of action is to make them feel like I understand them. I don't believe they will listen to me as well if I don't do this. I say things like ""it makes sense that you are angry at your brother, cause he hurt you, but that doesn't make it OK that you threw a rock at him"" then I talk about using words and other ways to deal with anger without lashing out. I also talk a lot about "" how would you feel if your brother did that to you "" kind of thing in an attempt to cultivate some empathy.

I know the listen to me based on how they change and grow. I try not to lecture too much or punish too much because they are kids and they are just learning these lessons. But they probably will end up avoiding trouble just so I don't bore them to death with another bs dad lecture. But hopefully my understanding and compassion is an example for them to follow. Because as well as punishing them I am also teaching then how to deal with conflict resolution, so I want to set a positive example."

229	dkzoey9	dkzqhw6	BitcoinMarkets	Agree.  I first noticed the slide when he mocked anyone who said the halving was priced in (which it was).	"*(Record scratches)*

Say what? I definitely didn't like the mockery, but I also don't think the halving was priced in. I think knowledge of the halving was priced in, ie. it wasn't a surprise to anyone that a halving would occur. But the actual process of pricing in the halving was a gradual one, for two reasons: a) it wouldn't be fully priced in until post-halving, when the threat of negative halving effects would dissipate (e.g. miners dropping off en masse), and b) the post-halving supply shock (of sorts) takes months to price in in and of itself."

232	dkzt53y	dkzvung	BigBrother	"Helps: Jessica, Elena, Kevin

Jessica is getting a lot out of this. Anyone in the house who was on the fence between Jody and Fucktwat United will definitely lean towards Jody after Thursday. They saw how immature, conniving, and idiotic Fucktwat United is, and will want Paul out as soon as possible. Elena will be helped by this as she was a fly on the wall, along with Kevin. They have no true ties with anyone, and nothing will be associated with them.

Neutral: Matt, Cody, Jason, Mark

Cody is in the same position as before. Mark is still safe, and isn't as much of a target, but still is enough of a target that it didn't help him. Jason and Matt are on the majority side right now, but once Fucktwat United falls, they'll be associated with them and will have a hard time assimilating. However, they still are in the majority so they aren't hurt right now.

Hurts: Raven, Paul, Josh, Christmas, Alex

Where to fucking start. Well for starters, Alex made a complete ass out of herself, proved that she isn't trustworthy, and lost all respect from live feeders so she will probably be in hit water after the season. Josh is still an idiot, and made himself target dos after numero uno (Paul) is gone. Christmas has no real ties apart from Josh, who is useless, so anyone present in the room when she was being a raging bitch about Cody's military background will relay it to Jody with no moral qualms. Raven completely shed her image as the poor little dying girl, and is now the immature brat. Also, she still currently exists as Raven Walton, so that fucking sucks for her.

And Paul. Sweet, lovable Paul.

Someone better upload this to Pornhub, because he just got completely fucked. There is literally no way to express how fucked he got."	your Hurts section was a work of art. can you make a bb podcast?

235	dkzqf5v	dkztb5v	IDontWorkHereLady	"I can see how that would be upsetting to see first hand the mistreatment of animals that are under human care and unable to defend themselves or get their own food. This is interesting because this is exactly where the ""angry vegan"" stereotype comes from. Try reading my first sentence again but thinking about factory farm animals. 
Honestly watch someone like Ask Yourself on YouTube who isn't afraid to show factory farm footage while he's making logical arguments or watch Gary Yourofsky's speech
[speech](www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4) 

I can promise you a better understanding of vegan perspective and there's a 90% chance you'll turn overnight.  "	"Please do not assume I am ignorant of the treatment of animals in factory farms. And please notice I said nothing against *humans* eating a vegan or vegetarian diet, only against feeding carnivorous animals a vegan diet.

In fact my only comment on human diets was that not eating at least some vegetables is unnatural for humans. And I was originally replying to your statement of
&gt;I know of people with cats and dogs who feed their pets vegan pet food. It's not too extreme when you think about it. Yes the animals naturally eat meat but when you buy pet food that isn't meat is it?

Edited to add, that trying to paint  the situation as a choice between factory farmed meat or a vegan diet, is as invalid an argument as using crappy  bargain brand pet food to justify feeding obligate carnivores vegan diets, or  someone using vegan junkfood to justify not eating vegetables. 

Picking the worst possible example of something you disagree with, and comparing to a really good example of something you agree with just makes it look like your position can't stand on it's own, and like you  think the people you are trying to convince are too stupid to see through the way you warped the facts.

Nevertheless, *you personally* aren't really contributing to the conversation by lobbying out little ankle-biter comments like ""Who said the US is a highly developed, first world country?""  That's why you're being downvoted all over: for being oblique, for stating falsehoods, and for unnecessary condescending hostility.

Having a political point of view doesn't mean that you can deny reality.  Having any point of view is pointless when you do not actually communicate it, as you did not do here until your second comment.  I honestly had no idea you were on about the wealth distribution.  For all I knew, you were upset about the lack of single-payer.  And finally, if you want to avoid downvotes, stop referring to your fellow redditors as ""sheep.""  From the evidence of your comments, you don't have a deep knowledge of anything, so please do not condescend to others that you do not know."	"Which falsehoods did I state?

I was downvoted way before I called people sheep.

261	dgydx2a	dgz2gv8	Games	"I wasn't the impression that Bioware was gutted of talent, I was and am under the impression that Bioware's talent is mismanaged.

I don't doubt for a second that they are immensely talented. But when you look at their more recent games, its obvious that their talent is not being reflected on all facets of their work."	"The Javik DLC from Mass Effect 3 is a good example of why management and publishing is a problem. They kept needing to extend and got pushback. Javik was supposed to be a bigger part of the story, but they had to cut it to work on other things. They kept a bit of it on disc because they wanted to finish it after the game was ""finished"" (already rated etc). After that, they finished From Ashes and it was ready by Day 1. So it looked like Bioware decided to cut a chunk of the story out for a few bucks when it actually wasn't the case at the end of the day. 

I do feel that Andromeda was mismanaged by both dev and publisher though. It's so obviously a rush job in the areas that were hard. Like branching story and those little details. They worked on combat and open worlds instead. 

So they spent 40 million on it, which is a bit too low honestly. ME3 was 40 million. Andromeda was a whole new engine AND a revamp of everything gameplay related. "

If you're so frightened by a bit of offensive graffiti, I hope you never enter a public restroom stall."	"&gt; For all we know, it could have been some 14-year-olds who thought they were being really edgy and mischievous.

The problem with this argument is that it's just as likely that it was a KKK member in a hood. Either way, it's bad. Either way, it's hurtful. Either way, it's disgusting. What difference does it make?"

276	czjb8s5	czjc0iy	ADHD	I didn't know it was free for a year as a student! I just started going back to school and have been debating getting ynab for about 5-6 months! Thanks you may have just saved my financial future! 	Oh, I'm glad! If you can't find the student discount area on the website, you can email their support team with your student ID info &amp; schedule for this year and they'll give you a 1-yr activation code. You can repeat yearly as long as you're in school! Hopefully by the time you're out, you can easily afford the official licence, since you'll be a great money manager by then :)
277	dgyxue6	dgyyegz	iRacing	"Not really, I keep hearing stories of how some of the top racers are still using G27's etc.

However a nicer set of pedals and a good wheel might help with your enjoyment of the game."	"They might be using g27 as a wheel (think some of them even turn off the FFB), but they are definitely not using the stock pedals for it.

If any equipment will help, it'd be better pedals."
278		dgyte76	Fantasy		I can't bloody stand them.  It's input overload for me, I find the background noise to be so distracting that I can't even process the words. That being said a lot of people have enjoyed them, and I'm glad they did, I just can't stand them personally.

280	dgysxea	dgyt7dd	DotA2	They get it, and so do I when I play offlane, but it makes their laning worse until PMS is complete. Pretty sure they would prefer being able to get 200g Stout Shield->PMS rather than 300g Slipperies->PMS, or even get Iron Talon+Stout Shield.	For sure, it would be better, but PMS adds so much value in lane, that most of the time I take risk of having less regen and rush to that 200g and complete PMS in lane.
281		dkzojg6	Warframe		"The [Prime Vault](https://www.warframe.com/prime-vault) will be available until sometime August 1st. In my opinion ,it is worth picking up. It contains a lot of good weapons. Rhino Prime is very strong, and Mag Prime is average.

Prime Access is so-so right now. Oberon Prime is pretty average. Silva &amp; Aegis Prime and Sybaris Prime are good.

The Steam Packs are not worth it at all."
282	dgyt6s4	dgyu4cw	Jeep	You don't need Rigid for a backup light or a light bar for that matter, you can mount any old led like this one - KAWELL 2PCS 18w LED Work Light Off Road Led Lights Bar Fog Driving Bar Jeep Lamp (2 Pack Flood Black) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HT642WY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_khObzb20004HT	so any led will fit im guessing?
283		dgyvrez	MakeupAddiction		"I have oily skin with acne scars and redness, and some lingering adult acne. I also have minor discoloration from psoriasis around my eyebrows. I have had good results using Clinique's beyond perfecting foundation--it's pretty full coverage on me (without looking cakey) and has never irritated my skin. 

For a low-maintenance, everyday work look where I want sheerer coverage, I LOVE Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC cream. This has a very natural finish but still enough coverage to tackle covering blemishes--and never any skin irritation. I'm on my second tube of this now, I get it at CVS and they always offer promotions for PF products. I think it's a great value product for the price point! 

I've also found Too Faced's Primed and Poreless primer to be a great daily primer for smoothing out the look of textured skin for acne scars, and this also hasn't clogged my pores. 

Edit: additional info

286	dkzn6s3	dkznovu	Roadcam	"> Show your working then?

I did. You said that normal overtaking would take 7 seconds if I'm going 120 and other car is going 80. You also said that this includes 2 seconds of buffer space before and after the car, this leaves 3 seconds to cover the 5 metres of the actual car itself. That's wrong and the numbers are taken out of thin air. They're not related to the real world in any way whatsoever. 

>Why does the video say you need half a mile of overtaking space then?

I don't know, maybe it's because that video is almost fifty years old? Cars were a lot shittier back then than they are today. 

>Seems like your link applies to motor vehicles and not bicycles?

Google Translate skips a few lines for some reason. 

What it says is that it's illegal to move livestock, ride on horses, ride bicycles, mopeds, all versions of quad bikes and all other modes of transport except for cars, motorbikes, trikes and cars with trailers, unless their top speed due to their construction or mechanical state is lower than 60km/h. 

>Cyclists ride on the road just like trucks do.

Cyclists can cycle on the side of the road, making it a lot easier to overtake them safely, because you don't have to go all the way into the oncoming lane. "	"&gt; They're not related to the real world in any way whatsoever.

The safe following distance for vehicles is 2-3 seconds. This is not some number out of thin air.

&gt; What it says is that it's illegal to move livestock, ride on horses, ride bicycles, mopeds, all versions of quad bikes and all other modes of transport 

This is all roadways or *motorways*? There is a difference between ""motorways"" and ""country roads"""

293	czio29a	czj9x2c	AskReddit	"To be fair, many washing machines are different and have lots of different, crazy and seemingly similar settings with vague explanations. 

Most of my friends don't know how to use my microwave oven even though they've used their own for the past 10 years. On my microwave oven, you first have to choose the ""mode"" you want to use. For example, microwaving, heating, defrosting. If you don't do this, it defaults to some kind of strange setting that starts at 90 seconds, and I have no idea what it is. 

[I recorded a video of my crazy microwave for you guys](https://vid.me/MNzN)"	"Oh my god, so much this.  I'm studying overseas right now and living in a dorm, and some of the native students were making fun of us international students for needing to have instructions posted on the washing machines on how to use them.  They kept going off about how we're rich assholes who have never even done our own laundry before.

No!  I've been doing my own laundry for years.  I just don't know my way around the washing machines in this country!  Yes, once I figure out the buttons it's fairly simple, but they are not the same buttons on an American machine and thus it takes a few minutes the first time to make sure you have actually set the machine to clean the damn clothes."

296		dgz12tx	RPGdesign		Just my first unfounded impression -- I'm skeptical of a system like that, because it could too easily be utterly pointless or vastly overpowered. Think of Quidditch - the regular game is utterly pointless because catching the Snitch (or whatever it's called) is vastly overpowered.
297		czj7h28	GrandTheftAutoV		"As much as I know everyone hates it, lately I've been driving around in the armored kuruma purely because recently I've been heist hopping.

301	czi86ed	czjeqr7	Flipping	Is it just the Sony's that sell well? Or any portable cd player?	Sony products sell loads quicker than say Panasonic, Coby, Phillips or unknown brands. If I see a Sony cd player, I don't need to really think, I just throw it in my cart. Other cd player brands, I always check the exact model before I buy and most of the time don't end up buying. People have a very strong preference for the Sony brand over all the others.

*He pauses for a moment, thinking.*

Are you still that...that Quarian girl? Or are you someone  different, someone... new?"	"We have both the memories of when we were Quarian and when we were Geth. Although, our memories as Geth only date back to our Quarian birth, as it was found that memories from before the subjects birth increased rejection rate and subsequent death by 57.35%. We now realize that we had to be stopped. Such a waste of life...

*She takes a moment to collect herself and moves on.*

And we are both that quarian girl, and the Geth that created us. And we are neither. We... are our own being. A blend of the two that made us.

304	czijv76	czj5g10	MachineLearning	Way more than 99 percent. Fan Hui, who it readily beat in five games out of five, is ranked something among the thousand best players in the world IIRC. So at best/worst, it can only be beaten by a thousand people of many millions of players.	Based on the description though, I think Fan Hui would likely win the next best of five.  It seems he spent some moves testing the machine, plus he's used to teaching amateurs and made a mistake or two from that.

309		dkzrt6g	Monitors		"I just bought the AOC AG271QG as an upgrade from the ROG Swift PG278QR. The AOC has everything in your title for $650 (plus overclockable to 165hz), and sturdiness from metal parts. It comes in Wednesday. I'll update this comment then.

Update: The AG271QG is a great panel. You can immediately tell it's an IPS, and loaded up with Overwatch, I didn't notice any dropped frames or screen tearing. Secondly, I went to lightbleedtest.com, and found no excessive light bleed anywhere. However, the top right corner of the screen does glow more than the rest of the panel. Thus to say, it's inconsistent, but the bleed isn't horrendous. Lastly, it's designed really well. All the stand pieces are metal. I feel confident it can survive a desk bump. It also has a hook behind the monitor as a headphone holder, and there's a hole in the middle of the stand for cable management. The title is 27"" 1440p 144hz IPS G-Sync, and it sells for $650. All in all, sensational."
310	dgyssc8	dgyt561	InitialDvideos	"He went beyond youtube, he's ""big"" on twitch now. Not streaming right now but here's his link: https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985.

Basically he stopped doing youtube for his own reasons, it like became boring to him, but he still wants to do non-gaming-related projects IIRC ([further explained here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvOeZa4uvI)). He has a [second channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL7DDQWP6x7wy0O6L5ZIgxg/videos) where an editor dumps a highlight of past twitch streams. He's happy and entertains people weekly on stream, so if it works for him, all the better. He's got a girl too.

If you followed Star, the same kind of thing happened to him too, at around the same time. [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Niichts/videos), [2nd channel with highlight streams](https://www.youtube.com/user/4O4STAR/videos), [twitch](https://twitch.tv/ster)."	Yeah I know star got popular on twitch. Good to see that jerma is doing well for himself. 
311	dgynjms	dgyvn9p	StardustCrusaders	Thanks for your compliment. I guess I have ended up making a full volume cover with the new border design [here](http://i.imgur.com/x4APwiP.jpg), it is a shame that I never got to post this version here early since it took long to make it.	Yeah that is a shame, it looks really nice.
312	dgyuwed	dgyv03x	AskMen	We need another qb to take over in the next couple years, but I don't know if Dobbs is the right one. Undersized for the duel threat that he is, and has accuracy issues. Still, if the steelers can coach him up, he could be good.	Nobody is the be all end all right when they enter the NFL. Look at Brady Quinn's career for proof. Just because you were who you were in college doesn't mean your pro career will be similar. He went nowhere while pro, and even though Dobbs has shortcomings, he can absolutely be tuned to be what we need.

As long as you are keeping lines of communication open, you will find the satisfaction that you are looking for.

(Wouldn't be surprised if wrestling was 99% of all of his camps for the past few years) I really doubt Masvidal's takedown defence is going to hold up against Maia's style.

If he can get it to the ground Masvidal will have nowhere near the ""success"" there Gunnar had. (Gunnar got dominated but not submitted, I would be shocked if Masvidal lasted more than a few minutes)"	I believe in maias takedowns but i also think masvidal has good defensive bjj.

345	dkzxzzv	dkzy0cy	CasualMTG	"A good way to think of Magic cards is like this;

All cards with a mana cost are spells.

When you cast a spell, it 'releases' the spell onto the battlefield from its card, like cracking open an egg. This is why spells like [[approach of the second sun]] still trigger even if countered.

So when you use up your spell, the shell goes into the garbage (graveyard) and whatever the card had 'locked inside' is now released under your control, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

What the spell contains is not bound by the same restrictions as the spell itself.

347	cziwkqs	czj56tc	Mavenfall	"Yeah, ""if"" you have a gem draw champion, which I don't. Plus even if I did have him I'd have to make a comp with him in mind since atm he'd take a spot away from someone else. Its not like having him just magically makes everything better, it means you can build a comp that is good against/abuses the same stupid shit as the comps with Bone Knight most likely. I mean I also own Song Maiden, because everyone gets her, but she doesn't fit into my current comp, and I don't mind most people trying to play the card, I dislike the bugs associated with how the card currently works. Once he's on the field for example, Viper Slayer simply can't attack past him properly the game just freaks out and doesn't do anything correctly."	I agree, once the bugs are fixed, it'd be good to see how the card really is.

362	dkzs9q9	dkzspu2	IronThronePowers	"Regulus was content to breathe in deep and peaceful and simply enjoy the moment. The way her curls tickled his face and chest was pleasant  as was all the sensations, but something more brought him calm; the feeling of loneliness and isolation melting away in the hands of his tiny princess. How one person could do that, he did not know, but he was content for once not to question it. 

His eyes started to grow heavy but they snapped open at the sound of Helaena's voice and concern flooded his body as she spoke. Honesty? Truth that would hurt? What on earth did that mean? 

His muscles tensed unconsciously with the foreboding that filled him, but his answer was simple and honest. He was who he was. He didn't think he had the heart to lie to her. ""Of course,"" he whispered. ""Although it would pain me to see you hurt, I couldn't lie to you. Why are you so concerned?"" "	"""It's not...It's not that I'm concerned. Or that I expect you to lie, I just...""

She just needed to hear him make the promise. But that wasn't what was important here. Perhaps he would be honest, perhaps he would not. She wouldn't blame him for being hesitant in his honesty, or in lying to himself as much as her. 

She took a deep breath, and clung to him more tightly. 

""I was wed, and married for seven days. I was fond of my husband, I desired him, I enjoyed being with him. I gave him my maidenhead, and we made love every night of our brief time together.""

Another deep breath, this one shaky and uneven. She was fighting off the tears that seemed ready to fall. 

""Does that bother you? To know that I was another's?"""

374	cykcwso	czjdr49	Games	With another pretty popular fighting game, I hope this wakes NRS up to fix MKX for PC too. Netcode and optimization still an issue.	As of this, seems they've all but dropped PC development - Kombat Pack 2 might not even make PC? Nor MKXL? Netcode has been tweaked for the upcoming update, though PC purchasers are left with major outstanding issues. A really bad reflection of promised development, being heavily weighted to consoles. Even the mobile game is getting more attention.

Ordinarily one would think that this is because the OP who allegedly knew the girl wanted to remain anonymous, yet the OP fully described her occupation, work schedule, and salary [in another post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ll4rw/people_who_dont_work_normal_3540_hrsweek_jobs_and/djv80hb/)

Perhaps this is irrelevant, but I find the staggered activity on the account peculiar, particularly when the OP claims to have seen the girl and be associated with one of her friends.

think about the what the cult would want to keep hidden, or lie about. he might know how a cell is organized, but his knowledge of how to contact a cell might have been all lies. he might not know who heads the cult, or if he does, only knows them as a shadowy figure giving out kill orders. if the cult higher ups say, intend to offer up the footsoldiers to tiamat as a snack, he might not know that, because the cult would want to leave out details that might break the narrative "

I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.

That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session.

Unless, that is, they paid even *more* money to have their kids stay in the bogus class.

**TL;DR: I could only handle three days as a call-center con artist.**"

446	czjczee	czjdt4a	AskReddit	"I think it's a little simplistic to suggest that they're basically different side of the same coin, I think we're past horse shoe politics. But, yeah, I can see what you're saying about both coming across as honest, which is refreshing to anyone. In fact I think they both poll very high in people perception of their honesty. Both are also definitely playing politics. Sanders definitely avoids saying things he believes for fear of bad press. I'll give you that Sanders ""demonizes"" the rich (even if that's not what I might call it), but he doesn't fear monger people with death like Trump does with terrorists. 

Getting rid of Muslims in America is not really on par with providing tax payer funded health care, which many countries already do. First, there's the matter of scale. Health care affects practically everyone, and I can't imagine that ISIS has been involved in more than 100 American (civilian) deaths. 

Maybe this is unfair to say, you tell me. Conservatives have a higher/better fear response, and consequently, the more successful conservative politicians will be those that fear monger. I honestly don't think you can say there's an equal opposite for the left. It's a stretch to say that Sanders is advertising free health care using fear. Being on the left and having nearly my entire social circle being on the left, issues like health care and minimum wage and wealth distribution in general appeal to my peers and I because of issues of fairness and opportunity, not fear, exactly.

I also think it's inaccurate to say that Sanders is money or power hungry. Sanders came from politics and social work basically promoting fairness (whether or not you agree with that or his/the liberal interpretation of ""fairness""). Trump came from being a business man. Granted, that means he has already come from money and power, and might not necessarily be seeking it in running for president."	Sanders himself doesn't need to do the fearmongering, but leftists are always like 'if the government(taxpayers) doesn't pay your healthcare, then you'll be bankrupt after 1 ER visit!'. Still, the socialist tactic seems to be more pity based. Like those stupid sad puppy Sarah McLaughlin commercials.
447		dkznleg	DotA2		"While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out.

**EDIT**
Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation: 

* Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.
* ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info!)
* Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.
* While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and *maybe* it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.
* All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead.


So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE  WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED!"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before."

452	dgz1102	dgz2dso	EliteDangerous	Small ships only sounds shit. And the amount of time in between each date is huge. 2 days to travel 500 light years? That's doable in 15 minutes. 	"The goal behind having small ships only is twofold: 1 is a very affordable expedition so many new players can easily join in, and 2 is to provide an interesting alternative to the traditional ""aspaconda"" expeditions. It gives a challenge to people to try and engineer their ass off with the small ships. It was a huge success last year (we had over 300 people register when we were expecting 50), and was a real blast. Sometimes quite literally."

"The complaints that turned me off the most were with OnePlus not the phone itself. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I've read it seems that OnePlus seems to drop support to phones quicker than people are comfortable with. In addition, the customer support is shotty, but that can be anecdotal although it still does worry me. The phone specs themselves are about what I would want in a phone and are a big upgrade from what I currently have. I dont mess around with cameras that often so the fact that the camera on it is one of its weakest points doesn't bother me too much. 

All in all, I am just trying to shop around for comparable phones and was wondering if there was something similar or more powerful than the OP5 whether the price is higher or not."

Last years Samsung Accom lasted for like *four or five months*. This one lasted for like four or five *hours* (well... ten hours, but still). \*facepalm\*"	Yes it is bs because with only 1,000 coupons and 1,026 stores there are entire stores that didn't get even one.

488	czba7se	czj6ui0	MakingaMurderer	"The problem with this theory is the profile and psychology behind Steven Avery. Killers fall into two main categories (which of course are broken down further but these are the two main differences) of organized and disorganized. This theory has SA organized one moment, and disorganized the next and switches his profile several times. 

SA is a man with an IQ in the 70's, highly disorganized as seen in his home and workplace, and has never shown any of the planning and awareness of an organized killer. 

This theory has him cleaning the gun and placing it back into it's original place,  cleaning up blood, DNA and other forensic evidence, using plastic sheeting, removing his fingerprints, being in full control in a kidnapping and he is able to fully burn a human body knowing exactly how long and what type of fire he needs. This shows SA as organized and intelligent. 

However at other times during this theory we have him bleeding all over her car and not worrying about it which shows he also wasn't wearing gloves, he decides to place the body and car on his own property even after having her in another remote off-site location, he throws keys and a license plate in a random place instead of disposing of them properly, and he leaves her spare key on the bedroom floor of his trailer. 

To make this theory fit, you have to change SA's way of thinking and personality as well as his intelligence and skill level. It just isn't plausible that at one moment he is cleaning a crime scene and the murder weapon, and the next he leaves a body in the backyard and leaves blood all over her vehicle. 

And before the arguments of who knows why killers do the things they do, or that killers are dumb and make mistakes, I do agree with this. However profiling and criminal psychology are powerful tools in investigating and forensics, and this theory just doesn't fit SA's profile. 

Also I didn't see where this theory explained the spare key on the bedroom floor or the fact that her body could not have been burned in the fire-pit. Even if you believe it was, it doesn't fit with much of the theme of an organized killer or a killer who would move her bones, as no killer would move the bones to a more obvious and persecuting location. 

Tl;DR - Steven Avery can not be Dexter Morgan one minute, and a bumbling idiot the next. 

Edit: I also want to add using his past crimes to build a profile to debunk this theory. In none of his other crimes he was convicted of (ignoring the rape for obvious reasons) he never tried to destroy or hide evidence, nor was he able to hide and food law enforcement. He never showed this sort of planning and intelligence that would be required for this theory to work. If SA did murder someone, it would be very sloppy and very obvious what he had done, and he would not be able to go for so long without slipping up and either admitting his guilt or saying something that led to his guilt.

All of them had 2 valid forms of ID, got SoCal gas utilities, and then swore under penalty of perjury that they were citizens? And they did all that without leaving even a single piece of evidence that they did it? That would have to be extremely coordinated, and if you're gonna put that much effort into it why not just get actual citizens to show up?

Don't hold back your tears. They aren't sadness, but instead a longing. A longing to be back there when we attacked life, when we were conquerers. 

Some men like us think they miss freedom and parties and ex girlfriends and young women but that's not it at all. 

What we miss is ourselves, that feeling at 16 and 18 and 21 that we were ready to take on the world, and we couldn't wait to stick our dicks into the whole world and watch it cum. Confidence for days. Chiseled abs. Pecs that made the girls gasp when we took our shirts off. We had it all but somewhere along the line it went away. We stopped fucking the whole world and it started fucking us. 

But we never stopped longing to be ourselves again, back when we had the whole world ahead of us"	Reading this awoke something inside of me. Definitely feeling some typa way right now.

523	czj6ea5	czjc661	AskReddit	"Well.... a few years ago my best friend at the time got mad at me, and went sort of crazy, for getting a boyfriend (the first guy I was actually serious about). She and I were living together (separate bedrooms) attending college and she was so weird about it that she didn't even want to be there if he was there and would leave the apartment any time he was over and text me wondering when he was gone. Keep in mind I would only see him every other weekend because he was also attending school at the time.

She started to get crazy and told various lies to my mom like I had been drinking and driving among other things when I hadn't. Oh and she told my mom I was having sex so that made things awkward. She kept feeding my mom lies and it ruined my relationship with my mom for awhile too.

She also essentially tried to turn all of our mutual friends at the time against me and became the new best friend to the person I hated most. They would search through my room and my stuff when I wasn't there too.

It sounds like something out of a Mean Girls kind of plot but it really sucked at the time. This all started right around when we moved in together so I had to deal with it for an entire year until our lease was up. I didn't find out about the room/stuff searching with my arch nemesis or her telling my mom a ton of lies until later on, but I had my suspicions. She and I have been friends for a long time but ever since that it just hasn't been the same really. We still talk and everything. Oh and I'm still with the same guy too."

539	dgyxho6	dgyzbiy	AskReddit	"Not true, what im going to say next sounds counterintuitive, but would be effective in taking the power and money out of the hands of people that wield that much power and influence.

Legalize drugs,  tax them, and take the money earned for taxing the drugs and put it toward rehab centers for people with drug problems.  Contrary to popular belief,  people who are addicted to drugs, are going to do drugs, and have much deeper problems  than the drugs they are addicted to.  If you offer them, safe, regulated places to buy and take the drugs,  you cut down significantly the amount of money el chapo is making.  

And with a national treatment center, funded by the people buying the drugs,  those people who need the help can get it.  

Those who are using them for recreational purposes will also fund the rehab centers. 

We as a society can insure those who use drugs might not die from bad drugs, and that those with real problems can get help.

Oh also,  people that control govts with drug money will be out of business and power.  

EDIT:

Winning a war on drugs in itself is an unattainable goal, as drugs will be done,  its in the nature of humans to use substances to escape stress/monotony/problems.  The war on drugs created the environment that the people OP mentioned can thrive in. If we remove that environment,  we remove them. "	The only way we win the war on drugs is to stop thinking of it as a war and start thinking of it as a social issue.

Usually this is in reference to dating. Stereotypically the asshole gets the girl, and she kicks the nice guy to the curb. The last sentence is saying that it is not the nice guys that are not getting what they want, but the boring guys. You can be nice and interesting and easily attract a mate. You can be mean and interesting and attract a mate. If you are boring and uninteresting, it doesn't matter how nice you are, you are not likely to get the mate you desire.

Once upon a time there was an 18 year old man who really *really* loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it.

Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her.

'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love.

Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well.

Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak.

The man knew what he had to do.

""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything! The wedding was saved!

""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment.

""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan.""

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Primal boss chance is the best relic stat in terms of soul farming efficiency. Other abilities that add to capped ancients are also good.

Primal chance >>>>>>> Primal souls (if Solomon under ~5k) > Double rubies (if decently active/scripting) >= Hero cost >> Primal souls (if Solomon over ~5k) > 10x gold ~= Double rubies (if not very active) >> Treasure chests > Boss life > Skill durations ~= Primal hero souls (if Solomon over ~20k) >>>>>> Other things

Primal boss chance is by far the best relic stat, and should be the main attribute you should look out for. 4% primal boss chance alone beats 3% primal boss chance with every other possible attribute at max level, for example.

604	dkzns9f	dkzx35x	Games	Not a very good defense, but the first 6-8 or so hours of the game are pretty mediocre at best. It picks up a lot after the first planet though. The game just leaves a terrible first impression.	I mean, they decided to stop the free trial right before you go underground on the first planet. If the game gets significantly better after that planet, then the free trial failed to sell me on the game. It's mediocre up to that point, and while it's not terrible, there's some weird writing choices that take me right out of the moment. The rest is just not grabbing me. Sounds like another bad decision to stop the trial before it gets good, and I don't think it's worth buying yet on blind faith until it falls under $20. And, maybe not even then.

i think that if it was on raw with maggle, jbl and byron/king i would have been completely uninterested.  the commentary team on LU is not the greatest, but striker and vampiro are reasonable good and helped me enjoy the match.  too much choreography and flippiness, which as i said is just not my cup of tea.  but solid work.

also, it helped that i had no clue what Puma's finisher would be and wasn't sure if Mundo is using his same old finisher from WWE.  so that added some element of suspense which improved the experience of the match.

it feels like it's too soon in the series to be bringing in the heel owner/authority figure storyline.  like, we don't even know the characters yet, it feels like this oculd have been a season one finale type of revelation or something, but whatever.....i'm not used to this format of seasons anyways, so i'm not going to get hung up on that.

631	dgypl53	dgyxezh	TrueAtheism	Thank you for this attitude. As a somewhat unorthodox Mormon, I always hope that people are kind when missionaries come to their door. Many of these missionaries are 18 or 19 year-olds fresh out of high school and have little or no experience with the real world. They get rejected at pretty much every door they knock on, and meeting someone who is polite, or even getting invited in, would be the highlight of their week. Certainly be up front with them about being an atheist (if you don't, they'll consider you a potential investigator and will probably come back the next week), but I'm sure they'd appreciate just talking with someone. In fact, if you're feeling extra generous, maybe offer to let them call their families. Missionaries only get to call home twice a year, so getting this offer from (gasp!) an atheist would probably do more than any religious discussion you could have.	Oh they must have me flagged as an investigator then because the Mormon girls that stopped by last time have been by like 3 times this past month. They're sweet though and like I said, I enjoy talking to them. I told them I don't believe in God when they asked the first time they stopped by, so I guess they're just trying to help me see the light. I was very religious for a long time myself so I get where they're coming from and don't feel insulted or anything like a lot of people do.

But yeah, I think in this context the unisex bathroom was a way of reducing inequality. However, I think this was only because of the accountability. We all lived on the same floor, we had an RA responsible for our safety, and if anyone had done anything sketchy it would have been noticed by the whole floor. 

I think you don't get those advantages in a truly public bathroom. Public bathrooms aren't a place where a community meets. They're composed entirely of random strangers. I think it's the anonymity that creates the danger. 

So anyway this was super rambly but I just thought I would toss out the idea that maybe not all unisex bathrooms are a bad thing (but at a museum? Yeah that's pretty unfortunate)"	Yeah, that's closer to being something like a home bathroom that gets used by all the family.

I sometimes get a headache from all the camera motion when looting quickly in 3rd person... I can't imagine how bad things will be in first person only mode.

He's squishy if you can catch him though."

i have found EIS to be pretty good on this phone, nothing spectacular but if you just pan around slowly with the phone, and try and have steady hands , videos should come out looking fairly stable and good, coming from a Edge +, not too much of a difference in my case"

707		dkzpwv4	Parenting		My child is almost 3 now and I still have those thoughts of wanting a different life. One where I am only responsible for myself. As a stay at home mom, my entire life revolves around someone else. I don't trust others to care for him so I bring the seclusion upon myself. And while I am depressed at times I can't imagine a life without the love of my life. It may sound selfish to some but everyone is different handles things differently. So even after 3 years I still sometimes get regretful. But when I think about losing him, I bawl my eyes out and I know I would never trade what I have now.
708		czj4pe1	Sverige		"Det här är inget nytt. 

Många av de steg r/sweden tagit vad gäller reglering har syftat till att strypa debatten. Först införde man ett politikfilter, sedan osynliggjorde man röstningssystemet, sedan införde man en politikfri månad just när invandringsdebatten gick het, och sedan bannlyste man politik helt och hållet. Inga sådan åtgärder togs eller ens diskuterades när det fortfarande var vänstern som dominerade.

I'd love if this was normal. However, the dislike button is kind of like booing at someone. It takes little effort, it's anonymous, and will always feel justified since there's no discussion over it.

718		dgywsxy	NintendoSwitch		I loved gen 5 and I thnk 2d would be great but I don't see many agreeing. Some people automatically think that the 3D graphics make it better. The pro to having a 2D game would be the size as it could be larger. Also the recent 3D games have added very few Pokemon and I think a 2D  game would add many more.

721	czj1evq	czj8fsq	AskReddit	"One of my favorite moments of dialogue comes from a deleted scene where Mal and Zoe just finished losing the battle of Serenity. There's fire and dead Browncoats lying everywhere. They're waiting for help and they see ships coming.

**Zoe:** Whose colors are they flying? ... Are we really getting out?

**Mal:** We are.

**Zoe:** Thank God.

**Mal:** God? Whose color is he flying?

I really feel like this is immense character development for Mal and should never have been cut. Throughout the series they never really explain why he is against religion, and I feel like this one little clip is an extremely powerful way to justify him.

That being said, seeing that clip after watching the entire series made it a lot more powerful. I think they should've included it somewhere in the middle of the series after they've established Mal's distaste for religion."	I thought it was pretty heavily implied in the pilot that Mal was religious prior to and during the war and became disillusioned with religion after losing the war.  IIRC in the scene at Serenity Valley during the pilot they show Mal kissing a cross.
722	czimcpn	czjd2vw	AskReddit	"I was ushering my class outside for field day, and everybody is joking and having a good time, when suddenly I hear ""You Dildo!""   I pull the culprit aside and ask them if they knew what they were saying.  They said they didn't know what the word meant, and I believed them - a lot of kids that age parrot what they hear without understanding the meaning.  So, not wanting to ruin the kids's day, I talked to them about not using words we're unsure about, and had him sit out of the first two activities. No biggie, problem solved.

We're having fun with the class when the principal walks up.  The principal had been talking with the kid, and asked me why the kid was sitting out.  I explained the situation, but the principal still didn't understand what the problem was.  The principal thought dildo was referring to an armadillo.

Yup, I awkwardly explained what a dildo was to my principal."	"My mother-in-law was a teacher for a lot of years. She had a principal that didn't know what a condom was. She had confiscated some from some students for some reason and presented them to the principal, he didn't understand what the big deal about the kids having some brightly wrapped candy was.

She had to explain to him what they were."

733	dkzvpif	dkzvqkl	SquaredCircle	Didn't anticipate an Enzo promo to close out RAW tonight.	I did once I realized it hadn't happened yet and that Cass/Show was the main event... Yeesh.
734		czjfs7v	The_Donald		Hear hear!  I'm probably the one guy who likes both Bernie and Trump (though I'd vote for Bernie).
735		dkzw6r9	Overwatch		Damn this is some smoooth footage
736		czj7nx5	AskReddit		Can't find the appropriate sub, maybe ladies of reddit could point me at the right direction?
737		dkzseeh	Waxpen		Don't go higher than 8 watts and you should be good
738	czjd8x7	czjgjlq	GifRecipes	I would think the second reheat would lessen the convective tissues greatly enough to allow much easier eating. 	"What you're thinking about only comes with bbq, sous vide, and braising. The 2nd reheat would slightly warm the inside, but not to the degree that it would break down the connective tissues you'd want.

All in all, this is a waste of food and time."
739	dkzx9ql	dkzxgv9	DarkSouls2	"Totally. I'm pretty rusty at DS2 but I used to be pretty nasty at it. I admit it's a change of pace from DS3, but I had a thousand hours in SotS before DS3 came out, so I'm up for whatever. 

Assuming you meant, ""do you really want a real opponent"" and not ""do you really know what you're doing."""	"actually i meant both and also ""I don't really care about winning""

anyways if you want a tougher opponent just make a sl150 character and streamsnipe a good twitch streamer when they're in the arena"
740	dgyokxu	dgyxf2x	NintendoSwitch	"Which is why items exist so that the people in the back aren't forced to staying in the back, and the people in the front don't get to cruise along.

It's an equalizer."	You're not supposed to equalize skill, otherwise what's the point in staying in any place? That being said, just make it an option, not the default.
741		dkzwbbo	The_Donald		She's a dog.

German is not a race retard! Germans are White. Jew is a race. Jews arent White. Get it? I explained it like youre 5.
Race is more than skin color.. how stupid are you? Are Black albinos part of the white race  because they have white skin? LOL"
744	czixh50	czj4hcg	GlobalOffensive	"when esports gets more views than ""pro skiing"""	"Her point had ZERO to do with viewership, she's not saying it shouldn't be allowed because of viewership. You're not arguing on the grounds she's established, and your point is completely irrelevant. Breaking Bad had more viewership than esports, should it be in the x-games? 

viewership doesn't define what should be in the x-games. I personally like e-sports in it, think its fine, and think everyone knows the difference between an esports medal and a snowboarding one, but I think you're argument is on the wrong grounds here. "
745		dkzrs96	AskReddit		"""no one has ever died from pot"" 

No one has died directly, car crashes, high firearm accidents and heavy machinery. Most alcoholics don't die from an overdose of alcohol they die as an indirect cause. "
746		dkzodi9	GuitarHero		frets on fire tune posting forum. 
747		czjeclx	TotalDramaTheGameshow		(wait. Where are we at and what do we have available to use? That'd be important to know for gathering water)

752		czj7pg4	SandersForPresident		If those are your options I suggest Vegas or Miami if possible.  Nevada is coming up after NH and will soon be in full campaign mode.   Miami would also be good because you can drive up SC before their primary after Nevada and still help with Florida canvassing after SC.  I would say move on to California from Nevada if you have time, however, California is a late primary state and there may not be much campaign infrastructure here yet.

756	dgys8pp	dgyschn	DarkSouls2	You mean your health bar? Just use a human effigy. 	No, I mean the number of total souls picked up which determines the toughness of summons and invaders. If you pick up 30,000 souls, and lose them, your soul memory is still 30,000, so your invaders and summons will be that much stronger than you.

I don't know why you're heckling me, but numerous others have pointed out ITT that the condi engineer numbers don't add up. Perhaps instead of asking me to record my memory reading DPS meters in action so anet can fix the loophole that allows me to have it working, you could do your own tests and confirm it yourself.
763	dkzqqzz	dkzqr28	PrettyLittleLiars	It really was... I feel like they should of revealed Alex 1 or 2 episodes before the finale.

764		dgywyhw	Ice_Poseidon		99% of other streamers don't fucking sit on a plane and say what airport they are at, also what gate they are at and the actual flight they are on. I love ice but he is pretty fucking dumb sometimes. 
765	dkz8vg4	dkzscc8	GlobalOffensive	And because s1mple was promised he'll be able to play whatever role he wanted and then was told he had to rifle even though s1mple was much better than koosta	I don't blame them. Simple is god tier with the rifle and the awp. Koosta is good with the AWP and thoroughly meh at rifling.
766	dkzplfa	dkzpp8v	SquaredCircle	Man maybe it's just me but I am just not a fan of Aliester Black. The 2edgy4me Shadow The Hedgehog character is just kind of lame to me. Plus his finisher is pretty underwhelming and I think it was originally Rich Swann's? Anyway, all the stuff that gets him good reactions in NXT I just can't see the larger stage audience caring that much.	To be fair, that's not a character per se. He has had an interesting life. 
767	dkzitvz	dkzr5he	Drama	"There is absolutely no evidence that Brown lay dieing in the street while the officer waited. In fact,  he was shot in the chest and twice in the head.  Evidence supports he was shot dead. What does BLM koolaid taste like?

>One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

The paramedics were actually on the scene within a reasonable time.  This  also while a unruly crowd began sweeping the scene,  they had to bring in more than 10 units just to control them,  and a swat team. 

The largest complaint about the body in the street is that locals complained the body itself was there too long while detectives rushed from other jobs to clear the scene and collect evidence,  all of this as I said with the beginnings of the riot happening.   

Edit: i just realized you don't want to talk about something that conflicts with your argument.  Lol nevermind"	"what you don;t realize I have never brought that up. We're talking about one thing, and you bring up something unrelated. We're talking about the kid who died because of meth, and here you are typing paragraphs about Brown?

Wut?"

769		dgyvlpa	Awwducational		Is there any evidence that flying animals have fewer vestigal body parts to avoid dead weight?
770		dgyxztt	SquaredCircle		Well that happened I guess.
771	czj9636	czj9f3w	CLG	Better use of his skill? They won the split lmaoo	Well, when immortals wins with better winrates or places better at worlds, they did use bis skill better, or, you know, the other parts of his new team are upgrades.
772	dgyz6ur	dgyz88l	SquaredCircle	So, who won Y2J Vs KO?	Jericho

775	dkzwv4r	dkzyjln	DCcomics	When talking about what each character brings to the story, he said Starfire is Sci-Fi (or Sapphire in this article, whatever that means), Raven is horror, Damian is Detective stories, and Beast Boy is comedy. He's said this multiple times, and again, anyone who thinks that comedy is all Beast Boy brings to the table does not get the character.	I think the person didn't realize he said sci-fi and typed sapphire, which is honestly hilarious. I also agree on the Beast Boy thing. In the NTT, Beast Boy was a tragic character who hid behind jokes to battle his depression. All he is now is this comic relief. 
776	dgoqj3n	dgz0bvv	EarthPorn	haha I live in Lethbridge, although I do spend some time out in Aetna every now and then (very very small village near Cardston).  I *almost* managed the Thirsty Bear at one point and declined that job like an idiot.  I still wish I would've taken that.	You might have saved yourself quite the headache. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.

782		czjejah	SS13		"I remember way back when on Hippie Station, before they beefed up security. I was playing a security officer, and I remember this shift as the day the greytide went worldwide.

They stormed the brig. Broke as many windows as they could. Blew up IEDs and fuel tanks outside the brig. Stole weapons, beat officers, and thrashed security in a great grey tide. It was the day the good security died, and the shitcurity harmbatoned their way out."
783	dkztkvn	dkzxlhk	PS4	Can you expand on this please?	"(Not /u/trickdaemon, but I've played the game...)

Aiming and movement were both done on the same joystick. I actually prefer it, since the grappling hook is how you do most of your movement anyway, but people whined, as they're wot to do. So now there's a dual-stick option.

The game is great, but challenging. I picked it up on day one and have put about a dozen hours into it. Look up a video of the opening cutscene and tell me you're not pumped!"

795	dgyn59z	dgz09c9	CFB	One of the big benefits of getting a bunch of commits now is you can get these guys to bond with each other early on. That can be a major help in getting guys to stick during the ups and downs of the season. 	Exactly... plus these are kids that make lives in college. Freshman year is when you build that foundation of friends you're going to have in college (I mean kids you meet a few months in, not those first 10 weirdos you happen to meet -- I still love those weirdos btw) and perhaps forever. It's hard to just transfer to a different school, I feel like you have to feel super neglected on the field *and* have a bad college life to decide to leave.

I am printing boat and canoe hulls with the keel down, default Cura supports and it almost looks like a little shipyard. It's easy to see entire ship hulls being 3D printed in the future. The Navy wants to do 3D printing on the go, especially things like 3D printed underwater surveillance quadcopters, print on board, deploy along the way, it returns, dumps data.

Didn't help almost my whole family is white collar women with business degrees. I actually make more in salary than they do and have ten years experience, but for whatever reason my family considers this a waste of potential and that I'm a dead beat because of it. I work seasonally on an island as a sous chef and co-run a successful food truck/waitress at a high end restaurant in the off season. I have a life I can afford and travel with, a great social life and I want for nothing.

I'm happy and don't consider that a waste."	I made the mistake of going against my gut and becoming a corporate guy. I think I'm still young enough to turn it around. And, while it wasn't all a waste, it was a waste. 
799		dkzsrrp	Smite		"Early game: khepri has better clear and lane pressure, along with a stronger level 1-4. Get suffers in the early game due to lack of clear and pressure, since the shield is garbage early. If you are looking for a snowball duo lane then pick khepri over geb. 

Mid game: khepri's mitigation becomes very useful, and his pull can guarantee a kill. Geb shield starts to come online and can provide better peel  

Late game: here is where the 2 gods separate in role. Geb has a much better initiation and can set up team fights and picks more easily than khep. Khepri is better at extending team fights because of his ult and can provide better late game peel from the root/pull, where as geb can guarantee more survivability. 

Conclusion: both gods are top tier supports. They both provide different things to a team comp and can be picked on preference. I think it is very ignorant for you to say that khepri is bad since he has one of the biggest pick ban rates in the spl and can change a team fight in many ways. If you are looking to snowball out of the duo lane pick khepri. If you want to farm until late game pick geb. They both do their role well, and because of that u can't say that khepri is bad. Kuzembo is a bad support because he lacks everything. Sure u can say that one is bad compared to the other but that doesn't make him unpickable which is what u seem to be saying. "

I dunno for some reason strangers make up violent crimes that I've committed."	"&gt;Except the only hate group here... is people who hate video gamers. What don't you understand about that?

Everything, because it's total and complete bullshit. No-one has done anything to you, but your group has terrorised women for a year and half. Don't try and pretend to me it didn't happen, I've watched it happen. I watched gamergaters publish the addresses and phone numbers of my friends to intimidate and threaten them. I still see it every day.

&gt;I dunno for some reason strangers make up violent crimes that I've committed.

You fly the flag of a group and you have to answer for what it does. You can't just say ""no I'm one of those moderate KKK members"".

Look, you seem to be working very hard to create this pretence that you did nothing wrong. It's not gonna work, you know what you did.

The good news though is the internet is anonymous. You can just walk away and leave your victims alone, and the only person you'll have to lie to is yourself."

I don't have a pack in the powder room, there's just no place for it. After seeing all the responses I think I'll figure out some way to include a pack. Just in case.

If you have your patterns, try taking some 3/4 inch dowel rod (or other small scrap) and cutting it to the beam length at each station (measured from your pattern), then wedge the dowel at the appropriate location to spread the hull.  it might take a small amount of sand paper between the rod and the hull for friction so it wont slip out, also might try some hot glue hold the rod in place.  best I got for ya.

I agree they have an incredible network and the disruption they've brought to the table is noteworthy, but I just don't see them as a great value long term. Netflix doesn't have any capabilities outside of its core business, and to me there is no huge distinction between the value Netflix provides in its original content versus that provided by Hulu and Amazon.

I find myself using Hulu more and more nowadays, and Amazon has the advantage of rolling a ton of value into the prime membership, versus Netflix offering you a very narrow service.

I don't think Netflix is a bad company and I use and enjoy their service. I just think that they are insanely inflated in value."	But fang...

I had wanted to learn for years but always let myself be convinced that I was too old to start learning.

After finishing the show, I decide if a klutz like Yui could pick up the instrument, so could I. I've been playing for about a year and a half now but only started taking lessons with a good teacher about four months ago.

I'd seriously doubt it's a re-lume. Does it glow at all? For a watch from the mid 60s, you'd either expect no glow at all, or a very faint glow for a short amount of time.

Thanks! You have a seriously great watch. I'd say wear it. Unless your job is seriously dangerous for watches, I'd go for it. It's a tool watch after all. Best way to enjoy it is on the wrist :)

939		czj8dpo	Aquariums		"This is a Finnex 12x12x12 cube that came with a Planted+ light.  I had this tank set up before, and had issues with algae (the light is strong for the tank, and sits very close to the top.)  
  
I wanted to add some snails to the tank, and wanted a lid to keep them from escaping.  I also wanted to slow evaporation (I have very hard water, and hate the calcium lines I get), and keep the bubbles from the sponge filter from popping and splashing on my monitor.  
  
I went through a couple samples and tests and ended up with this.  It was printed with PET+ (basically same stuff plastic water bottles are made up of) which is hydrophobic - so I'm not too concerned about toxins or breakdown.   Pretty happy with the results.

944	czjf6t5	czjf9u6	DestinyTheGame	"My wish list for the Crucible:

• Double the spawn time of special and heavy. 
• Add just a little more flinch to snipers.
• Reduce aim assist on all snipers.
• Bring Thorn's damage in-line with legendary weapons. The DoT should be what makes it exotic, but it shouldn't do so much extra damage. 
• Bring TLW's damage more in-line with legendary weapons. This thing is way too strong. 4 body shots for a kill, and 2 to the head (hipfire). This thing shoots faster than MIDA and doesn't even require headshots for a fast time to kill. Reduce the extra damage. 
• Since TLW gets bonus damage while hipfiring, shouldn't First Curse at least get some sort of bonus damage while First Curse perk is active? Why can TLW kill someone with max armor in 2 shots, but First Curse can't? (Assuming TLW doesn't get nerfed.)
• High impact auto rifles need crit damage increased. Higher impact autos should have the farthest range as well. 
• Focus Fire perk on high impact autos should make crits at a minimum of 39, and not the current (33).
• High impact pulse rifles should be restored to their former damage. 
• Fusion rifles should be effective outside of shotgun range. I'd say about double the range is good. Tightening stability goes hand to hand with effective range. 

I know it's a pretty ridiculous list, but I think I'd actually be able to enjoy the Crucible if these changes were implemented. We *need* variety. I'm just tired of being killed by the same six weapons every game. TLW, Thorn, MIDA, 1000-Yard, Party Crasher, and Harrowed Quillim's Terminus.

Edit: Of course I get downvoted because nobody agrees with a TLW rebalance. I've been on the receiving end of that weapon for a year now and I can say that I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was already perfectly balanced. "	"I think these are all good except the TLW nerf. It's a shell of its former self, and it just straight up dies outside of, like, twenty feet. I never feel like I've been unfairly killed by it any more. If I get melted, I had it coming.

If it gets nerfed again, it becomes unusable, and I don't think that's necessary."

It's obviously worth it since I was at zone ~3500 after a year before transcendence and my HZE is now 25k+. To speed things up, before you transcend try to have a mercenary quest for 10+ relics complete, 50 or 100 rubies saved for quick ascensions and at least 1 clan boss reward but I go for 2.

After you transcend, hit 1 quick ascension and go for the ancients you want, if you don't get any of them hit another quick ascension hoping that you can get the ancients you want. Then collect the relic quest reward and equip the helpful ones if there are any, then use your Ancient Souls, don't forget to use them!

958	dgynpw2	dgyz9js	TrueReddit	"Oh, wow.  There are so many things, that it is hard to narrow down.

First would be manners, those raised in middle class families usually have a much greater understanding of propper manners, how to dress, how to act, when not to use vulgar language, appropriate things to talk about, etc.

A huge one, though, would be *frugality*, which I think is an entirely middle class ideal.  All to often those from lower class homes, even when making decent money, would be ""rich on Friday, broke on Monday."". The idea of being frugal and saving money is not common.  Usually those, in my personal experience, from the bottom of the spectrum where those most likely to buy expensive electronics, clothes, cars and such rather than saving.  Another example is that in my early twenties, I knew two types of people who would go blow $300+ at a nightclub:  rich kids from wealthy families, and poor guys from poor families without education.

An intangible difference is a feeling of dissatisfaction.  As I was working and poor, I knew I was poor, and I knew I had to do something about it.  I had an idea of how it should be.  I could not imagine trying to have children or other things while in that situation that would hinder me improving.  For those who have never seen better, the first time they had any amount of income above living hand-to-mouth, they considered themselves well off.

I know this sounds kind of arrogant, it is not my intent to blame people for being poor, but these differences are apparent, and it is likely because those raised in the lowest social and economic classes do not have a concept of how others act.

Also, I believe in general, most all of the poor people on reddit are more similar to myself, even if they have poverty or working class level income, they likely have a middle class background and a good portion are educated, though perhaps with useless degree and a heap of debt.  Socially, though, this site is in vast majority middle class."	"&gt; All to often those from lower class homes, even when making decent money, would be ""rich on Friday, broke on Monday.

I think about it in terms of food. If you're poor, when you get your paycheck you don't think ""Wow, now I can buy two months worth of rice and beans"".

No. It inflates your psychological (and literal) appetite so you crave steak."

Of course, I didn't think so at the time). Now, I had been a fairly sheltered kid. I had no idea why she was doing that or what I was supposed to do. She dancing a little, going up and down, looking back waiting for me to do something. 
Then it dawned on me, I knew exactly what to do. 

I turned my back to her, backed up into her, and we rubbed backs for a solid ten seconds. She turned around with the most wtf look on her face and disappeared into the mob of people. 
We never spoke or saw each other again, and I'm glad we haven't."

1017	dkzq3wa	dkzqc58	BDSMcommunity	">Also, in the future, I think calling someone a ""stickler"" for safety and protocol will not help your argument that you are in full control. 

Well, I'm sorry my opinion gives you a false perception about me - I suppose what I find annoying is different than what you find annoying. "	"I was only trying to help. I fear you've posted a question without preparing yourself for an honest answer and criticism. 

Seat belts can be ""annoying"" when I'm trying untangle myself to reach something in the back seat, but I don't not wear it or complain about something that will literally save my life if the worst case scenario happens."
1018	dgyt0e1	dgyyg8z	AskReddit	"I received a letter after donating blood years ago with a big PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL and IMPORTANT on it. Letter states I had a false positive on the necessary HIV screening. It had huge markers insisting I did not have HIV but they were required to notify me. 

Apparently certain auto-immune diseases (which I have) can cause the pre-screen to test false positive but after all additional testing, they confirmed it was negative. Considering I had no risk factors besides medical procedures, it was a huge heart attack day for me. Took a while for me to calm down and a few more blood tests. "	"That sort of thing sort of says ""FUCKING OPEN IT"" to most people who aren't the intended recipient. "
1019	dgyuwk4	dgyz4u4	MMA	Not sure why it's called an oblique. Maybe that's where the kick is usually thrown in that that boxing. I do know that it differs from a side kick in that the toes face to the outside of the kicker instead of towards the inside.	"&gt;Not sure why it's called an oblique.

Same here, oblique sort of means ""at a slanted angle"" and I think oblique kicks are unique because you connect while the knee is still bent."

The problem is that it is not official and anybody that uses it is both exploiting and cheating and then trying to dignify it by saying ""It makes these useful"" and ""Everybody is doing it"". If I see a Kapkan use an invisible trap on my team I put a bullet in his head and I will keep doing it until Ubisoft comes out with an update making it official."

1036	czj22wl	czj7tcw	Python	"The hashes do not come from the server.

PyPI displays (unsafe, unreliable MD5) hashes of packages, but that is not used in any way by this feature of pip. What's going on here is that you, the end user of pip, will manually obtain a known-good copy of the package you want, compute the SHA-256 (or other stronger hash of your choice, so long as `hashlib` supports it) hash of it, and put that hash in your requirements file. Then pip can -- locally, on the machine pip is running on -- compute the hash of the package it downloads, and compare to what you provided. If it matches the hash of the known-good package, installation succeeds. If it doesn't match, installation is aborted.

So while it's not full-on package signing (which would be nice but requires a whole different kind of infrastructure), it does give you the tools to avoid ""malicious index server giving me a bad package"" problems, so long as you're using it responsibly.

(also worth noting that PyPI does actually support signed uploads -- I do this with all my personal packages, and Django has been doing it for years -- but the end-user package-installation toolchain doesn't have the infrastructure to do full web-of-trust verification of those, hence my parenthetical in the above paragraph; if you're interested, click [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.9.1) for example and scroll down to the file list; you'll see both the display-only MD5 hashes of the files, and links labeled 'pgp' which are the signatures for those files)"	"&gt; PyPI displays (unsafe, unreliable MD5) hashes of packages, but that is not used in any way by this feature of pip. 

*Not by this feature, but pip does check that the hash given in a fragment of the package download url (which will be the same as that displayed on the page) matches that which it calculates on the package downloaded. This is purely file-integrity checking."
1037		dkzqeyo	AskReddit		"We adopted a cat a few months ago, so we're still getting to know him. He's about 18 months old, give or take. When we brought him home, he seemed like a regular cat, but we quickly realized that he's super smart. 

He can open our shutters; he works a paw between two of the louvers and pushes them up or down until the whole shutter is open, so he can watch the birds in the backyard. 

We've got a wall niche where he loves to hang out, so he's up off the floor. There are light switches on one side, and after seeing someone turn on a light ONCE, he pawed at the switches. Of course he got a reaction from us, so now he regularly plays with the switches to make us laugh. 

Any door or drawer that is even half a centimeter open is likely to end up being opened and investigated. He's ended up in some pretty interesting hideouts. 

He's amazing at playing fetch -- his favourite toys are pompoms from the dollar store, but he'll retrieve just about anything if he's in the mood. 

He knows what birds are -- if you say there are birds in the backyard, he'll go to the window to watch (his favourite thing). Better yet, if I grab my laptop and ask him 'want to watch birds?' he will start meowing, then run over to curl up in my lap and watch a youtube channel I found that shows birds and squirrels at a feeder (it's actually designed for cats to watch when owners aren't home). 

When we realized how bright he was, I decided to deliberately train him to do some things, to keep his mind busy so he wouldn't be bored and wreck the house. Within two weeks he had learned to 'come', 'sit', 'beg', 'shake a paw', and 'gimme five' -- he's a cat, so he'll only work for treats and only if he's in the mood, but it's still astonishing to me that he's so incredibly trainable. 

Edit -- I forgot his best 'trick'; he saw one of us turn on one of the roombas, and because he LOVES to chase them around he figured out that he could push the button on top twice in a row and make the vacuum start up any time he chose. Now every once in a while we'll hear him take off downstairs and pounce on the vacuum so he can stalk it. People tend not to believe us until they see him do it, but he seems to like to show off this particular trick for guests. Several times now we've been visiting with someone in the living room and the cat will just appear... meow... swat the vacuum... then deliberately paw the button. My mother-in-law went nuts, she just couldn't believe it -- 'that wasn't an accident, he had to push the button two times! Oh my god! You need to get that on video!' We're definitely going to try, but it's tough since most of the time he does it at 1am when we're asleep! :D  "

1073		dgyrvo9	TheLeftovers		I don't think most of them actually believe their theories to be correct- they're just having fun with the show. The fact that Lindelof has said that we wouldn't get an answer to it, leaves room for people to create their own theories. I don't see the harm in that.

I'll be junking on Doritos and DVD on Valentine's. no SO, no problem, no date though. If someone invites me to go on a date that would be cooler then ;)

Timeless games, backwards compatability from the previous station every time (GBC-GBA, GBA-DS, DS-3DS, 3DS-Switch, Game Cube-Wii, Wii-WiiU), and from my own personal experience great customer support. "	"How do you even buy a Switch from Nintendo? Walmart and Best Buy don't carry them. Amazon has them at twice retail from scalpers but Nintendo doesn't actually sell them at retail. 

It was pretty messed up how they botched the NES Classic. But at least the Raspberry Pi exists, and RetroPie.

Still wouldn't say they're evil, but they're not very pro-consumer. I'm just glad Breath of the Wild is 'out there' and Cemu is being actively developed. I want a Switch, but there are some major issues Nintendo needs to address before I can consider one."

1085	dkzf4dl	dkzoxwm	AskReddit	"By that measure then, the Persians never lost to the Greeks when they invaded Greece.  They simply didn't win.  You can very easily see from the point of view of those being invaded how it would seem like a victory.  

The US invaded a British colony, got defeated and repelled, got pushed back on all fronts, and was forced to sue for peace.  That seems like a pretty clear cut British victory to me."	The Greco-Persian wars are a lot more complex than how your presenting them, by the Greeks did actually gain from the end of the war due to the establishment of Greek colonies throughout Anatolia.
1086	dgz19rq	dgz1fhq	Libertarian	owner not author.	Owning something doesn't mean you have the rights to distribute it for profit, those rights belong to the author (unless given away).  If intellectual property laws were removed, everyone would have full rights to distribute and so anyone could call themselves the author.
1087	dkznv3r	dkzqow2	StardewValley	"I had the opposite experience last night. The lady with the cart had cookies. I have gestational diabetes and have to ignore all my cravings. When I saw the cookies I was like ""omg! She has cookies!"". I spam clicked to purchase all the fucking cookies and wasted a bunch of money and then realized: wait..these are not real cookies, I cannot eat them."	"Oh nooooo!! That's like dreaming it's Friday and waking up to find it's Monday! Will you be able to eat cookies when your term is up? My piano teacher had a major issue when she was expecting and for the second half of her term couldn't eat anything with fat...basically. I think she was on a straight like...lettuce diet. 

The good news is, you can do what I do, IRL...which is give the cookies away to people to make them like you. 

...wait....did you say lady? I thought that was a dudebro."

As a note, amendments aren't accomplished by voting on bills, but rather by Congressional voting on an amendment proposal, and then it being handed to the states for a referendum."
1090		dkzw7ak	CODZombies		I love shadows and playing public matches too. It would definitely have better games but i love watching what develops in random games. Shadows is great for this, for example (Im generalizing like a mofo rn) noobs will learn/do the civil protector over pack a punch and sometimes the shield. Camping by the box in footlights is the popular place to be. And of course due to the lack of pap for them the raygun is actually something they want. 
1091	dkytbjr	dkzw3q8	OutOfTheLoop	You can get better pasta from take-out pizza joints... let alone actual restaurants.  Want inexpensive soup/salad/breadsticks -- hard to beat i guess.	Yeah, the draw for most people is the unlimited soup/salad/breadsticks thing I think.

1095	czj8bqr	czj8d3g	CasualConversation	I play the...piano/synth, guitar, bass, djembe, cajon, melodica, ukulele. I think my favorite is the melodica 'cause it looks so weird when I play it in public. The best use of melodica for me is in the acoustic version of [Der Kleine Vampir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p72mFG9DchI) by We Butter The Bread With Butter	Do you watch the Late Show w/ Colbert?  His band leader plays a melodica all the time.
1096	dkzobgl	dkzoya3	DnD	"If your party is expecting you to soak up damage, then absolutely; however, if you have the lowest hit points in the party that's probably not necessary. If you have another idea for a feat that would let you be an effective member of the party in a supportive role, it sounds like your team will be meaty enough to allow it.
That said, if you'd like to be in the thick of combat you should take tough."	"I think i can handle the damage with the Lay on hands, plus the fact i have an adamantine plate armor that will help me in case of crits, so i probably won't fall that easy on battle.
And thanks for helping!"

1101	dgysjwg	dgyu7el	HappyWars	"Just because you challenged us months before dont mean SHIT lol.. 

first of all it usually takes awhile to really get everyone on, n as i said several times, i made SURE that PTC was going to play the devs, that was top priority..along with wanting to get neeg to play, which the hours he got on was always different...n when we did play...it was fucking random...wasnt scheduled..lol..if that had happened earlier, we would've..but around that time, was time, because we had just got done smacking the devs..

REGARDLESS..you STUPID FUCKS trying to use that as any leverage?? ""it took months""

SO FUCKING WHAT??? WTF does that have anything to do with?

so that gives u the right to play one game?? and dip, and NEVER come back to the system??

u call yourself a great player?? play ONE MAP?? if you are GREAT, you should know..a FUNDAMENTAL thing..such as different maps, is different strategies..

We all played warrior...LOL...did this kind of out of tactics..i wanted to say we beat u guys with all warriors..but the lag was more then expected...Han n Atom both using dash attack warriors??

point is, we did things i knew we shouldnt have...BUT i knew, when shit hit the fan..if we didnt win the first game..then shit was going to get changed up...dash attack warriors..vs laggers..like shaymin, n pInda..n jin...are USELESS..

i didnt care, it not like i wanted to lose the game..but i knew, that if set up correctly, we would have a better chance of winning...i wasnt going to lose the match...but i wasnt showing all the cards..im to tactical for you to get...to wise

PTC was better, YES i can say that..and more legit

Noble, including yourself WAS a bunch of cowards..and i say this, because of your own doings.. n your lack of acknowledgment of how u, and ur team approached the game..

you started playing with AKira because he was good??? LOL???

COME ONE NOW

How about Pinda???

Jin?? he was just a real good mage!!! he wasnt laggy at all!!!

LOLOLOLOL 

shaymin? one of the laggiest 1v1 warriors EVER??

supernice?? a brick wall

defending YOU...one of the laggiest players EVER..

all you laggers..surrounded yourself around other fucking laggers..

and you KNEW IT..

STOP acting like you didnt know LOL..you aint that fucking stupid...u just dont want to accept it...n mad because i brought it to the proper attention..

that is because if u or anyone gona sit there, n say Noble was the best...LOL its just laughable..when putting everything into consideration..

IM the best player ever...I KNOW legitimatizes... where YOU obviously dont

Think about all the players i mentioned in Noble..all the laggers...jin, shaymin, you, pinda, supernice, akira, oooalmightyoo (when he switched, didnt switch with us)

along with SEVERAL other laggers..that i forget their names..

and then...you add the Japs???? LOL which was basically Noble...???

everyone of those players, are laggier, then PTC's laggiest player...

PTC laggiest player, woulda been less laggy then Nobles least laggiest player...

the lag wasnt in comparison..

PTC was as legit as you're going to get on a team...aside from when you joined..lol....but u were put to use against other laggers, so it was a trade off to some degree

Im always logical, always rational, but when you miss simple shit, i become irrational with ignorance..

when you KNOW how u approached the game in comparison to me...

you KNOW the amount of lag you played with on your team

this is a good word for you...

COMFORT...you KNOW when you have that type of lag, it gives u a COMFORT..

that is why we couldnt play with Goosie any more...or at least couldnt have him push...because his lag...was to comfortable..to easy..u give me laggers like that??

just isnt fun...in a group..?? u know this comfort level im talkin about..

and u ignoring it...and not accepting it...is why i emphasize on the word coward..

ALL these things into consideration..

then..

you play us...in...One...

game.....

not a match...so dont say MATCH..remember now...its cowardess to not acknowledge simple things.. (as we just went over)

a GAME..

think of it like this...

boxers, schedule fights..months ahead of time...more then months..

it would be like fighting a third of the fight..the first 3 rounds out of 12...and be up by points...and leaving the arena...and being like

""Im the best ever"".. when he was barely winning...

where is the LOGIC in that??

it is STUPID that i have to explain this..

not acknowledging this..is ALSO cowardess..im trying to prevent u..from falling into cowardess train of thoughts..realize when you know you have done wrong, in what ever way it may be...accept it..and learn from it..

U can NOT argue..that Noble was as good...n sure as fuck not better...when u played ONE game...and Noble NEVER came back to the console...EVER AGAIN

I KNOW you got tired of me saying im the best...im the best...so u started saying Noble was the best...

but u forget..THEY ABANDONED YOU..lol...like???????


??????

n NEVER came back...supernice in that party...said something along the lines of 

""im never coming back again""

u can NOT compare yourself to someone, or a team...when you RUN SCARED...LOL...

THAT is ILLOGICAL...

there is no rebuttal here..Furthering defending what Noble did, and what Noble was...is just pathetic...not accepting fundamental shit..

N on top on it...LOL

WRITE MUSIC, IN SO MANY WORDS, CONFIRMED BASICALLY ALL OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING....

n HE was the MAIN GUY in NOBLE..LOL..


AT LEAST HE ACKNOWLEDGED...ACCEPTED....AND NOW RESPECTS

the words of WISDOM, the words of TRUTH that i speak...

i put to much time into the game..i have to good of a understanding..

that aside...what Noble did...is blatant...BITCH shit...plain n simple...

PTC was a REAL team...pretty much the only real team the game ever had..lol...

#Logic+rational=Strapz"	"Write Music was the main guy in Noble.... Far from. If anyone was the true leader of the clan it was Super Nice and me and him co lead it. 

Stop trying to suck up to him, just because he's essentially telling you what you want to hear. It's what I used to say you did with Dragz. You overate him as a player so much. It's because he was a big part (even essential) in creating the modern PTC. 

Write music simply told you that noble is filled with cowards.... so what 1 person (who btw hardly played with noble) now proved everything. Ever thought about how he clearly has a grudge with me?? It's why he said all that stuff. 

You completely overate how laggy Noble was while discrediting PTCs lag. 

You fine well know inspire, steez, Dragz, Han and keytro have been called laggers time and time again. 

You also have NO IDEA. who was in Noble. If your going to take 1 thing from this stop telling me who was in noble. Japs didn't play with NOBLE. I used to play with japs along with Dragz and supernice.... BEFORE NOBLE. 

Almighty was never in noble. 

Pinda wasn't either. 

Also you don't understand how people like Akira came into the clan. Of course he wasn't recruited. But it was when Titan split up. Players got thrown around, people's were friends etc. You couldn't split everyone up. Noble black was nobles top 8 players. That 8 has as much lag as your top8

Straps stop trying to discredit me. It's ridiculous. You fine well know what you said to me while in PTC. about how people overate my lag. Y don't you make a fuss about inspire?? He used to lag TERRIBLY and you knew it. 

You had months to fight noble. MONTHS it does not take that long to set up a match. If both parties want to play a match, regardless of time zones/jobs/school. The time can be found. I've played enough clan matches to know. 

Noble or PTC were not better than each other. 

There were weak links and carry players. 

PTC was nothing without you, me of steez. SS was right they absolutely would of beaten PTC without those 3 players. Same with Noble of it wasn't for me and Supernices defence the clan would of been nothing, obviously would of been a great clan, but the best? no. 

So forget the clans. The clans don't hold any value really. 

I didn't get tired of you saying you were the best. It was your constant discredit of Noble. Most of the stuff your saying straps isn't true. Of course noble had lag like pretty much everyone. but it was exaggerated, exactly the same with PTC. 

Noble was NOT a clan when we fought. It's the same question, why was flukes PTC when we clan matched??? because Noble wasn't a clan that's why. "

The two then talked about how each other had been and played but the major moment of talk when Tawn explained that he lived in a box when he was younger. After that, he noticed Amethyst's weapon and showed her he used something similar in the form of a sharpened wrench that he made for ranged capabilities. Their social short comings kept them from connecting until they played. After a short round of roughhousing that left Amethyst unable to move on the floor. The two talked about their experiences and lead Tawn to invite Amethyst to a pasta night with him and his team after giving her one of his sharpened wrenches that the girl was enamored with earlier.

*****
&gt; Ivanka Trump, the president&amp;#039;s daughter, and Jared Kushner, her husband, had pushed the president to hire Mr. Scaramucci, seeing him as a way to force out Mr. Priebus, the former national Republican committee chairman, and his allies in the West Wing.In that, Mr. Scaramucci was successful.

&gt; Mr. Scaramucci&amp;#039;s swift departure is an early indication that Mr. Kelly intends to assert his authority over the operations of the White House, and that several of the big personalities there - including Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump and Mr. Bannon - may be inclined to defer to him.

&gt; The president still values Mr. Scaramucci, according to people close to Mr. Trump and his family, and is hoping to find another, less high profile, position for him in the White House - although it is uncertain if Mr. Scaramucci would be willing to accept a demotion.

That being said, he's definitely shown somewhat of an understanding of the character when he's written him as a background character, so we will see where it goes I guess.

I could launch into a nice long paragraph describing the history of Public Housing policy in the United States, how urban tenements first gave rise to building codes, and the first public housing projects. How these projects failed when they became to grand in size and scope, which lead to alternative policies such as use of section 8 tax credits to try and increase the supply of affordable housing, which eventually culminated in Mortgage Backed Securities being pitched as a tool that would allow lenders to serve clients they otherwise wouldn't touch, because other banks were willing to absorb that risk, and thus these lenders wouldn't be as leveraged and could afford to write more loans, and give those loans to middle class people who otherwise could never afford a proper down payment.

The thing is, I find these super polarized people like you on reddit to be laughable. You are no different than these Trumpettes screeching that Orange Mussolini can do no wrong. Basically, you believe the world is completely black and white, and that all banks are evil, and everything is the fault of corporate greed. It is a fucking joke. Reality isn't a movie. The truth is most people in that industry are good, morally sound, hard working people. Sure, there are individual instances of greed and douchiness, which you could find in every industry. If you want to actually have a serious conversation about the multitude of systemic structural flaws that led to the Sub Prime Mortgage crisis that is a conversation that can be had, but having it with the Occupy Wall Street hippie crowd that not only doesn't even understand what the banking industry as a whole does, but just wants to point fingers and screech platitudes, well that isn't going to be very productive.

1212	dgygtr6	dgyt87e	OverwatchCirclejerk	[verwijderd]	"A guardian angel to those who come under her care, Dr. Angela Ziegler is a peerless healer, a brilliant scientist, and a staunch advocate for peace.
After obtaining her MD and PHD in Switzerland, Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.

Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.

During her Overwatch years, she once dressed as a witch for Halloween.

Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. One example was the development of the biotic rifle by Torbjörn. Torbjörn provided assurances that the device was only intended for healing, but Ziegler maintained that this was setting Overwatch down a road that could lead to the weaponization of biotic technology, and that she had only conducted research in the field on the condition that it would not be used for offensive purposes.

Seven years before the present day, Ziegler was involved in an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander Jack Morrison to end the King's Row Uprising in London, England. Earlier the same day, Ziegler argued with Morrison over Overwatch's inability to intervene in the conflict due to the English prime minister expressively forbidding of any Overwatch action within the United Kingdom. Dr. Ziegler expressed her concern for the thousands in the city who needed medical aid, and lamented how Overwatch was made to help people, not sit on the sidelines. After Jack authorized the mission, while preparing to board an aircraft, Ziegler welcomed Cadet Lena Oxton to the team. She commented on how her inspirational words convinced Jack to authorize the mission, and how he was very invested in her career, and had asked Ziegler to keep an eye on her. Zigler then told Oxton how she could call on her if she ever needed any help.

In Overwatch's final days, the group was faced with a series of allegations, and Ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the United Nations. In light of the fight between Overwatch members Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, Ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable. They had drifted further and further apart ever since Morrison had been chosen over Reyes for the position of strike commander, and that rift had widened despite her efforts.

Mercy helps the innocent
When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by war. Though she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled, hoping to make a more peaceful world.

When Winston issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Mercy was in the Middle East. Mercy was unsure if Overwatch should be restored.

Hope that helps.

1219		czj5z1f	HaircareScience		Don't desparage. It took me years to get my rotine down, but it is possible to resolve an itchy scalp. When my scalp gets flanky/itchy....I will actually lose sleep and when I did sleep, I'd scratch my scalp till I'd find blood under my fingernails. I've gone to dermatologists, removed sulfate shampoos, tried natural ingredients  (tea tree, neem oil, etc), tried salicylic acid shampoos, coal tar shampoos, the zinc compund head and shoulders uses, selenium sulfide shampoos....the whole friggin gambit. Here's what works for me: first thing, i never wash my hair the same way twice. Mixing it up somehow helps. My shower looks like a crazy person's because I use so many different products in rotation. Then I do a multi-step process that seems to work. First I use a generic shampoo in a quick and dirty way that kind of breaks up the oil in my hair. Then I use a salicylic acid shampoo (dermarest, specifically.) The chemical exfoliation helps the next step work better. Then I rotate between a 4% rx ketakonazole shampoo, coal tar shampoo and head and shoulders. Hope this helps.

1260		czjg84u	AskReddit		Even though I had been to Vietnam with high school, it was pretty scary/exciting going to Italy alone and spending a month there before university started. Book a ticket and have plans of where you're going to stay before you go! I rented an airbnb place for 5 days when I arrived but had nowhere else planned to stay for 3 weeks afterwards. I sorta wished id planned ahead but it was fun searching whilst knowing I was running out of time. Luckily a guy id met once in Australia who was back in Italy allowed me to spend a week with him and his family.

1309		czja7dc	LearnJapanese		"So I've found this post about the same topic, discussed from a Japanese speaker's point of view:

http://cpplover.blogspot.jp/2012/12/blog-post_18.html

There's a link to this /r/anime thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14z01e/looking_for_instances_of_an_often_used_quote_that/c7hqldn

Which leads us to this /r/bestof thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14zw76/alayavijnana_explains_the_meaning_behind_the_he/

I don't have the time to read all these posts so here's my answer.

殺す is 'to kill' and 死ぬ is 'to die.'

「彼は殺しても死なない」 literally means ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""  

You will find translations like ""You couldn't kill him if you tried"" because the English sentence I gave above apparently doesn't sound natural.  Literal translation would still be ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him.""

The Japanese sentence 「彼は殺しても死なない」 is as self-contradictory as ""He wouldn't die even if you killed him"" but somehow feels natural.  In short, I think it's more about what kind of a sentence feels natural rather than the implications of the words 殺す/kill and 死ぬ/die.

I haven't thought this through but this might somehow be related to the ""Japanese doesn't have sarcasm"" trope.   Or I might be completely off the mark.  I must go out now...

When I was training as a runner one night, I was going with my FTO to relieve someone for a break. I had left my water sitting on top of the water cooler in that POD. When we entered the POD, I saw my cup slide off of the water cooler, hang in the air for a split second, and splash onto the ground. I turned and saw my FTO who looked unnerved, so I asked him if he saw that? He told me, ""I didn't see shit, Dude."" He refused to talk about it after that.
One time when I was a runner for the building our isolation unit was in, I heard the bars shaking in one of the units. It was after lockdown, so I was a little perturbed by this inmate making noise. So, I pulled my keys, unlocked the cell, and saw the bars shaking, but the inmate cowering in the corner crying. After a couple of seconds, the bars stopped shaking. I hung out with the inmate for a while calming him down. I made up some bs about how we had water pipes that were causing the bars to shake. Unfortunately, that cell was pretty notorious for being ""haunted."" 
Finally, me and several other runners were called out to search the building for someone who was seen entering our visitation lobby around 11:30 pm. I checked the only doors going into the lobby and they were fully secured. We searched for a good 30 minutes, even climbing into the false ceiling, and never found a person matching the description given."	That's crazy stuff! Thanks for sharing.

Hence the **point** of gradual ban time increase. idk how many times I have to explain myself. seems like the only ones being stuck up are the ones that have crashing problems. you guys should spend more time coming up with a fix and mess time arguing this great ban idea 	"I only said you seem like a prick because you're asking ""what is wrong with you people,"" as if we are at fault for not wanting people to be unfairly banned. 

This just isn't a good idea. You have to attack the problem at it's core. Rage quitters are not the issue you are trying to address here. It is salty/toxic players. 

For example, you miss a save. Your teammate ""what a saves"" you and votes to forfeit. You don't vote and so he just leaves. That player is clearly willing to give up 15 minutes. If we include some time of increasing time length ban and that person then isn't willing to give up 2 hours (or whatever) of time, in all likelihood they're just gonna stay and be toxic. Play against you. Drive around aimlessly. Talk trash in chat etc. Is that any better than if they had just rage quit? You have to understand that if someone who doesn't want to play is forced to play, in most cases they aren't really gonna try to play productively and win. Additionally, we can't forget about what will happen to all the people who have an unfortunate week of power outages, wifi drops game crashes etc, and are suddenly hit with an hour long ban even though they never rage quit once.

There's nothing wrong with pitching a new idea. But you shouldn't be so agressive against others when they suggest to you reasons why your idea wouldn't work."

The past 30 days has seen the Euro (Finlands currency) weaken from about 1.13201EUR:1USD to it's current 1.18433EUR:1USD This is not quite 5%, but still fairly significant.

Currently NOK is at 5.38 Euro, which would be 6.39 USD. On US exchange, $NOK ADR is $5.36. This is within 1% of the exchange rate. 

If you overlay the NYSE and the HEL charts, around june 30th the NYSE ADR appears to be doing better. That is because from the period of June 26th to the 30th, the Euro weakened considerably vs the USD ~1.8%

In addition to currency exchange rates, the discrepancies in the highs and lows can be explained by the timing of news releases. Generally the Helsinki exchange and the NYSE track each other within a few percent, but Nokia releases many PR and their earnings reports after market close in Helsinki, which is premarket in the US.

There is also most likely a difference in perception of the company between European and American investors to take in to account.

Seoul responded to Trump's comments by saying that under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it. Do you have any evidence that that statement is false? You say the THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA. THAAD is no exception. 	"Did you even read what I wrote? Or are you just trying to strawman me? 

&gt;under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs US military presence in the country, South Korea would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it

Yes, as I said the THAAD deployment was ""negotiated under the SoFA"" but it is not specifically stating that the U.S. must pay for the THAAD system. Go, ahead read the SoFA and find me where it says the U.S. pays for all military infrastructure because you won't find it. 

&gt;THAAD deployment is not in SoFA, but as far as I know, every US military endeavor on SK soil falls under the regulations of SoFA

Like I said it was negotiated under SoFA and falls under the regulations of it, as every military operation is, but it is not a part of the SoFA so if we decide to not deploy it or demand payment for its deployment nothing is violated.

Example: if a car dealer sells a car he must include a warranty under law, so that sale is covered by law, but then if the dealer says no actually you have to pay an extra $x or i'm not delivering that car he can do that and is not violating any law."

I disagree. Knowing that the studios are driven to seek the highest return for their film means they'll constantly be searching for corners to cut. VFX has been one of those corners for a long time, and the fact that there hasn't been union representation has helped that. Establishing union agreements for the industry will change that.  
 
When that happens, they'll continue to try to make their product for the cheapest possible and sell it for as much as possible, as many times as possible. It just won't be on the backs of the VFX artists and studios any longer."	"I honestly don't think we have the same understanding of supply side economics.

This seems like the most important point. Games just rarely go that late anymore (assuming average to high MMR games).

That said, it doesn't impact me too much, unlike the removal of FotM—with right masteries, you used to be able to get 40+ regen by stacking health regen tank items (FotM + SV + Guardian's Hammer), all for just 6k in gold, and can conditionally bypass Warmog's in favor of other items that are more useful in team fighting.

I am _really_ curious how the midseason update next week is going to affect the tank and bruiser builds, though, especially with the addition of those two superb tank items (Adaptive Helm for anti-skill and DoT spamming mages, and Gargoyle for multi-man resistance gains). For one, I expect the likes of Cass and Teemo to see some drop in win rate over the next few weeks."	"I think a big reason for me is on most AD tanks/bruisers i can usually utilize regen. If there's a few enemy AP's i can build visage and titan hydra. Lots of ap add banshee's. 

On any tank who has any built in heal this is so much better than mogs. It gives you the versatility to build more ad like black cleaver, armor/hp items, or just sheer hp. And you continually scale into more damage dealt, while getting lots of hp and regen. You just get so much synergy with useful buildpaths mogs feels less ideal as a third item. 

It would be dope if it got reworked, even in ARAM only, to be a pure HP item with a unique benefit. Get rid of the regen and CDR and come up with something unique. Maybe make it give you either bonus armor or bonus MR depending on what you have more of? 

Idk you could come up with something fun and balance-able."

For example, a couple where both spouses make 50k/year will pay less tax than a couple where one spouse makes 100k/year with the second spouse having no income. 
As I understand it, spousal RRSP's were designed to allow the higher income spouse to put RRSP's in the lower income spouse's name in order to lessen the income gap and thus reduce the couple's taxes in retirement.
Since then however, those with a qualifying pension can elect to split their pension (for income tax purposes) and thus reduce the couple's income tax. A more direct and sure way of evening out a couple's income.  
Thus, it appears to me that since the introduction of pension splitting, spousal RRSP's have lost most (all? I am not a tax expert) their relevance. "

If you have already leased the tower you have probably provided them an easement (and probably access to it) but that may be a question for an attorney who would need to review your contract with them. 

For example, this is not very clear:  *It is only accessible by bypassing my property's main/only entrance.* if your property is not the entrance then how is it accessed? May need to upload a drawing for us to view. Or aerial image from google or something.

So not really sure what else they want, now? 

It surely will impact your property value when you sell, how much is a very market specific question. You'd need to talk to knowledgeable local agents or hire an appraiser. You'll get a bunch of guesses here but that's all they will be. 
 "	Thanks for your input! We acquire the 40yrs lease when we purchased. Currently, they want to buy out our lease with a lump sum, but have perpetuum easement. (so I can't change my mind and not give them access? Lol) My property is land locked with different businesses on each side. The entrance/front area closer to main street are mix-businesses, and the tower sits on a small corner in the back of the commercial property.

I should've said ""It *came* true. Now what?""

And I still want an answer to that. Your ""False prophecy from Satan"" came true, and built up the body. Now what? Do we add to the Bible? No. Because Scripture DOES in fact carry greater weight than some specific Word for a specific time and place. Scripture (aka your precious ""canon"") is for all times and all places. Not all of God's Revelation is. Otherwise we'd have a record of what those poor, ""falsely prophesying"" 70 elders said.

1520	dgz1e9f	dgz2a68	PoliticalDiscussion	[verwijderd]	"Grow up, dude. I answered your question respectfully.  If you disagreed you could've addressed me respectfully as well. However, I will be the bigger man here and respond to you like a human being.

(1) Many economists tie the 2008 recession directly to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.  The lack of separation between commercial and investment banks is likely tied heavily with the Recession. Things along these lines are difficult to prove though, as are many things economically.

(2) I, individually, don't have the right to limit power. But, as an American, I support and elect the people in the government. And the government does have the power to tax and limit power.  A tax on the richest of us (read: Wall Street) can be used beneficially to help the poorest of us. Robin Hood took from the rich to give to the poor. And the average person doesn't care about the globally economy of they're still dirt poor. And, because of income inequality, they're getting poorer, while the rich are getting richer. A Robin Hood tax could alleviate the wealth gap slightly.

(3) The fact that the media is owned by so few large corporations. The fact that in many areas you only have one choice for cable providers. I could go down the list. Monopolies exist. Many monopoly laws aren't being enforced. I don't need to create new monopoly laws.

(4) Yet, somehow, politicians still get paid tons of money from corporate donors. Look how many politicians on both sides of the isle are in bed with certain industries.

(5) Profits not being spent on improving the company should be taxed. They're doing no good and not helping the economy by sitting there. Do you really think that Exxon needs as big of a profit as it does?  Money should be put to use improving society, not locked away where no one can touch it.

(6) People do store their money in places like the Cayman Islands all the time. People, using creative tax ""loopholes,"" find ways to avoid paying taxes on their money by keeping it overseas. That needs to be stopped.

You don't have to agree with me. And, as I said, it's possible not all my ideas would work. I'm not an economist or an expert on the subject.

Now, rather than saying you disagree with my philosophy (it's clear that you have a more libertarian economic philosophy, which I don't agree with for a variety of reasons), why don't you say what you believe should be done to eliminate income inequality. Do you even think that's something that should be eliminated?"

1579	dku306j	dkznpni	OutOfTheLoop	"He is a relatively new rapper that comes out of South Florida. A couple things gained him attention:

Many of his songs feature aggressive lyrics and yelling. This is unusual in the mainstream hip hop genre and appeals to some of the more aggressive types.

He was punched on stage by a Rob Stone supporter (the guy who made Chill Bill) and consequently set off a rivalry.

His most popular song, ""Look at Me"", has an extremely. similar flow to an unreleased Drake song, nicknamed ""KMT"". If you want to look up a side by side comparison, they are in fact very similar. Xxxtentacion called out drake for this alleged copying. 

ASAP Rocky shouted out him on social media I believe, which gained him a huge chunk of attention.

During his time at prison, where he was charged with assaulting a pregnant woman, (a charge which he denies heavily and there is no concrete evidence for) he heavily increased his cult following and people were saying ""free X"", most notably Lil Uzi Vert.

I listen to him and went to his concert, his music is kinda fun if you're a fan of the loud angrier type stuff. However he does put out slower songs, more so before jail, and other songs like Riot which have a different style overall; if you're into that.

1598	czjcje0	czjgev5	Christianity	"> I'd say atheists could learn from Christianity how to be more humble and cautious about proclaiming the accuracy of the popular scientific models.

It's certainly true that some atheists need to follow this advice, having based their rejection of Christianity on scientific results. (I recall one time being broadly rebuked in an atheist forum when I suggested that the theory of evolution might eventually be replaced by a better theory.) 

Some other atheists, however, reject Christianity on its own (lack of) merits, science being irrelevant. I'm a former Christian in this category, who after a long struggle had to give up on Christianity because its internal workings simply did not make a bit of sense. I couldn't tell what I was supposed to believe.

"	Evolution wouldn't so much as be replaced as it would be refined.  You would have to ignore all the current evidence for it to replace it completely.  Instead, it seems more likely that that evidence could be interpreted in a slightly different way.  The observation already happened.  Though, the understanding could change.

Where things begin to get complex is that this conveyor (actually a scroll with conveyor underneathe), Will be stopping and starting quickly in a way that the robot cant control. The manufactures I've talked with (Fanuc and Denso) all have issues maintaining accuracy in the accel/decel phase. 

Also I'm in search of a good/simple VR physics sandbox for modeling alternative solutions to this problem, if there are any recommended programs for simple brainstorming/animation. "	"The robot arms are modeled in Blender and then the IK coding is done in Unity. Yes, velocity and acceleration are specified on a per-joint basis, along with the appropriate limits of rotation.

Vallejo is very forgiving in terms of brush strokes, but they're bad at sticking to the plastic (the primers are better, but still not great). Tamiya is harder to get an even finish with (retarder is supposed to help), but dries quickly and bonds well. With gunpla you're assembling painted pieces and posing, so being able to stand up to scuffs can make a difference. That said, the suggestion to use lacquer thinner is a good one if you don't mind the fumes. Vallejo does have a great color selection, plus lots of primers, varnishes, mediums, washes, etc. Whatever you choose I do recommend using a real thinner; water/alcohol aren't quite as nice.

I'd say get some cheap brushes that aren't bottom of the line, different sizes. Always use the largest brush you can for a piece, to minimize brush strokes. Invest in nice fine tip brushes for smaller details -- I like the gsi creos ones, you can get them thru Amazon. Strong, even bristles and predictable behavior will save you headaches when trying to paint the little stuff.

I use the alligator clips on sticks. I hold them by the clip while painting (sometimes challenging to find a place to clip it on) and put them back on the stick to cure.

No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful. I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit? Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it. 

So yes, you're a troll. "	"&gt; No, you're a massive troll because nobody could have so many horribly offensive viewpoints. Nobody could possibly be so hated as you are on these subs (from what I've seen) and not get the message that your comments are rude, unwanted, and unhelpful.

My viewpoints aren't even remotely offensive. If you've got a very thin skin, then yeah maybe my comments are rude and unwanted, but they certainly are very helpful comments.

&gt; I mean seriously? Vegetarians are inconsiderate for not eating meat, nobody should own pets, fuck women because they're all worthless piles of shit?

The views that I have aren't horribly offensive at all. Regarding women, I never said that they were ""worthless piles of shit."" It's just that Western societies like ours are under siege by feminists who say they want ""equal"" rights for women when they actually want female domination. Women are mentally and physically different from men and thus should not have the same rights that men have.

&gt; Nobody really believes this stuff, and if they do, they'd learn pretty quickly that nobody else wants to hear it or takes anything of value from it.

Despite the number of downvotes that I get from cowardly, close-minded people like yourself, there are still a lot of people who agree with the things that I say. I believe everything that I write, and I'm sure that there are people out there who appreciate what I have to say.

&gt; So yes, you're a troll.

No, I'm not."

If you do not move into that slowly and deliberately, the penance for the first week or so is more olfactory than dietary.

I mean swimming is probably the closest, because it can be dangerous, and you might find a pool at your friends house, but swimming has been taught in schools. However you don't go over to a friend's house and find a rock wall high enough to seriously injure you and a bicycle doesn't kill you if you sit on it wrong. 

I make the sex ed argument again. Would you say ""don't have sex"" is a good enough sex education? No because it's not. People are going to have sex. Guns are cool and when kids (and adults) see them they want to look at them and touch them, even if they know they shouldn't. Yes you teach not to play with the gun, but you should teach how to safely handle one in case they do anyway. "	"&gt;However you don't go over to a friend's house and find a rock wall high enough to serriously injure you and a bicycle doesn't kill you if you sit on it wrong.

You are far more likely in life to encounter steep drops then guns. 

And more likely to encounter a bike than a gun.

So your saying it makes more sense to just avoid those things if your not trained to use them correctly and safely?  You should avoid the edges of sharp drops, and not ride a bike in the street?  A rock wall isn't the only thing a kid might try to climb.  trees, buildings, bluff faces, fences...  shall I go on?

Kinda like you shouldn't handle a gun, and the solution is the same thing, but for one you want mandatory training?  So rather than waste money so morons can be justified not locking their guns up properly, how about we continue to teach kids not to touch them.  It works for most children, after all, its the exception, not the rule, to have a kid playing with a live gun."

Truth of the matter is that this woman had no idea whether this was the case or not, only presumed the cop guilty, and she herself drove distracted shooting video while admittedly speeding, endangering everyone around her that she so self-righteously claimed to be protecting from a speeding cop.  

Get off your high horse. Nobody anointed you into some police oversight position. Drive safely to the station (you passed right by it off I-95) and file a formal complaint with the desk sergeant if you're so concerned. "	Seriously, she even says in the video that she has the the police car's vehicle number. She doesn't even have to go out of her way and drive to the station, she can just call them at home and report a dangerous driver. I guess speeding while filming a youtube video meant more to her than solving the issue in a safe manner.,

1765		dkzporv	ADHD		"I'm dual diagnosed.  Was on Vyvanse for 1.5 years, till I realized it was making me panicky and jittery...  (Think panic attack but the entire day...  But I just thought it was stress, since I only really take it during the academic year.)  It also was messing with my sleep, I think.  (I've never complained about it, thus never diagnosed, but anxiety is typically comorbid in ASD.  And Vyvanse is known to exacerbate anxiety in people who have anxiety issues.)

Since they are so often found together (ASD/ADHD + anxiety), I'd probably look more at how the meds affect people with anxiety (if this is also a problem for you), rather than how ADHD meds affect people with ASD.

No side-effects on Adderall (XR and IR), though it doesn't give me the energy that Vyvanse does.  I kind of wish I could combine them, but my psych said no.  :(  lol

Neither medication ever left me ""hyper,"" and both increased focus.  Though Adderall doesn't quite work as well as Vyvanse for me in that regard...  It's all about how each med affects you, specifically, because everyone's biology is different -- even if we have the same disorders. 

As an aside, even people who *don't* have ADHD or similar will still usually get increased focus from stimulants. "

Don't get me wrong I am tempted to pay the $10 to try it out for a month... but I don't particularly trust BPG to run the game properly, and to be honest I can get the same thrills I use to get in DF in other games that are not nearly as life draining.

I just don't want to watch the game slowly die again, be it from the game simply being out of touch with what the MMO crowd expects or because BPG runs it into the grounds.

Before you say anything I have the same predictions for DnD.  I think both are doomed projects, although each I have different thoughts on why / how.

1776	dgyvvij	dgyxcb3	ClashRoyale	Goblin gang, zap, log, skarmy, skelly (keep those tho), thombstone, cannon, ice golem, and ice spirit to name a few	"I agree with Log, Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, Skeletons, Cannon and Ice Spirit being very powerful for their costs. 

I personally think Ice Golem is good where it's at, as a cheap mini tank/distraction unit/skeleton killer who does very little damage and no longer has a ridiculously large frost nova.

Cannon itself isn't too strong in my opinion, it's just that it's too similar to Tesla and thus replaces it any time someone looks to add a non-Inferno tower defensive building. To me, the solution is to buff Tesla, maybe by allowing it to hit two targets like Ewiz (no stun effect) and slowing it's hit speed accordingly so that it's DPS doesn't get insanely good.

Tombstone I feel is fine, definitely an annoying card especially if you're using Hog Rider or Elite Barbarians, but it's low hitpoints make it reasonably strong against ground tanks and troops. Maybe a slightly slower stream of Skeletons would be good, but that might kill the card's usage entirely.

Zap is a weird one because for the longest time it provided too much value, but after the damage nerf I think it's found a good niche as a reset card and Skeleton Army killer. The problem with Zap of being an easily overleveled common won't disappear unless the developers address that problem, so unfortunately overleveled Zaps will continue to be a nuisance. But in challenges, Zap is pretty balanced because it doesn't kill too much and the duration of it's stun isn't too long. The most frustrating part about going against Zap is how quickly it's deployed when compared to Arrows, which did receive the deploy time buff recently but still feel considerably slower. So perhaps a slight nerf?

Let me know what your reasoning was with the cards you mentioned!"

oatmeal and couscous simply need hot water to cook and are pretty cheap if you're looking for warm carbs. Peanut butter sandwiches won't need refrigeration. Neither does fresh fruit. My mom volunteers for a food bank that depends on the discards of a local grocery store, and you can't believe how much they throw away. Trust me, you can eat fairly healthy if you're willing to ask for help.

If you're in a suburb or smaller city, some grocery stores will have a cafeteria area *with a microwave*, so (also check out hospital cafeterias, open to public until dinnertime - last time I had to spend a lot of hospital time, it was open to the public until 6 or 7p). If you're flexible about your mealtimes, you may also be able to plan the ""big"" meal of the day for when you're at work.

Also, I wanted to let you know that there are some amazing shelters specifically targeted to the working poor. [This](http://www.ccsww.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homeless_reachout) is the one that my church hosts for two months a year and &gt;50% of the participants have jobs. Some guys are employed full-time. Even if shelters are not of interest, please ask around for spare camping gear that will make your car experience more comfortable. I see a great interest in warm socks/hats/gloves from folks in your situation.

Since you have food stamps, I'm guessing you're already ""in the system"" for social services - if not, I'd strongly encourage you to look at the library for direction towards resources for resume/interview prep.

good luck! and take care!

But I am pretty sure it won't be less than $200 because it includes a whole other camera (which I hear they're also having issues with) and two controllers. I'd imagine it might even cost up to $300. Vive is seriously your best bet.	Don't get me wrong I want a Vive it just depends on how much it costs up front. I don't see the camera being that much on the touch, it's a camera ya know? They are pretty cheap these days. I hadn't heard about the tracking issues but if so that's a definite issue that would change my opinion.

1835	dkzq64c	dkzqxiu	PersonalFinanceCanada	No I meant guaranteed. The essentially was to summarize the info. Sorry for the confusion.	"&gt; They offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.

I'm reasonably familiar with seg funds in general.  Not so much in the specific anymore.  So take it for what this is worth, I did a 2 second drive by because my initial suspicion is that your statement is false.

The 5% your talking about applies to increases in retirement income - they're saying your income is gtd. to go up by 5% a year once you retire.

That's not the same thing as saying they offer a guaranteed annual return of 5%.  

It's also not saying good or bad.  It's just saying, I don't think 5% guaranteed annual rate of return."
1836		dkzs1df	FORTnITE		I played on PC since the Alpha and it acts as my main account but I also have friends on xbox to play with so I purchased it again. Similar thing happened, I played for a few days and finally got an error message when logging in via Xbox and when I went back to PC it wouldn't let me in either. The fix for me was unlinking my Microsoft account with my main epic account that I play with on PC. Then creating a new epic account for the Xbox, and linking it to the new one. Signed out of the new one, signed back into to the old one. It eventually let me back into my PC based account. Went back onto my Xbox and it also worked and I still had everything I had obtained from the past few days. The whole making you go through the tutorial again I didn't have to deal with so that sounds scary.... I don't know if my fix will help with you... but if it does, yay?

1838		dkztdu2	Entrepreneur		"&gt; Am I listing the wrong products?

No, but you aren't listing enough. Generally speaking 1% of your stock sells per day. You would need 100 items to get one sale every day. With 3 items, you're looking at over 30 days per sale. You gave it a week.

I would expect your numbers to be slightly less, probably about 0.5% of available stock per day because basically the only customers you'll get are the ones too lazy/stupid to do a simple search and find it on Walmart's website.

&gt; How can I get to where I can actually start making some money?

To be frank, you need to get off your ass and do some work. You're not going to make money listing a whopping 3 products, and that shouldn't have taken a week to do. If it were that easy everyone would list 3 products on eBay and retire.

You need to use all your available listings. If eBay gives you 100, you need 100 products listed. Next month you pull what doesn't sell and you add other products. You repeat until you make money. But this whole listing 3 products and expecting to make money? That's not going to happen."
1839	czj8we6	czjap00	AskReddit	Really, I'm American and ever since I learned about the GB pronunciation I thought it made more sense. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any other elements that end in -um that *don't* have an i there. Francium, Cesium, Iridium, Lithium, Magnesium, Uranium, Plutonium... so Aluminium fits right in.	"Platinum, Tantalum, Molybdenum, Lanthanum are the only other four elements that end in ""um"" but not ""ium"". Though Copernicium could have ended up being ""Copernicum"".

What's more interesting is the original, and now obsolete, name of Aluminium was ""Alumium""."

2) to cover, my process is first find midi versions of the song, and load them into a daw. Identify the imoortant/memorable parts of the song, and delete the rest. Make an arrangement that will work on the POs limited polyphony and number of patterns. Take advantage that you can repeat patterns if possible. Dont try to make a note for note cover.

In some cases, the U.S. has major corporations paying nothing at all with the current tax code.  That makes no sense whatsoever given that corporations use the nation's infrastructure more than citizens do.	"Those loopholes and exemption aren't cost free in an economic sense. Deductions and exemptions in the tax code influence behavior. The new behaviors aren't always the most rational.

In many cases, entrepreneurs will make bad long term decisions in order to chase a tax break. Lots of companies will relocate operations to sub-optimal places in order to attract a one off tax subsidy. Think of how much time NFL team owners spend trying to lobby for a subsidy. Right now, Apple is sitting on a huge pile of overseas cash and is simultaneously borrowing money in order to issue dividends because the foreign cash is taxable while the interest payments on the debt are tax deductible!

We want companies to think about how to maximize profits, not thinking about how to minimize their tax bills.

We know that inefficient tax gaming happens for individuals. Look at how many people buy a house ""for tax purposes"" or choose a poorly performing 401K plan because they get an upfront tax deduction. *Many* people put money into a flexible spending account only to lose those funds the next year because they didn't spend enough on health care in time."

1. Black cleaver is a great item for the cdr and utility and you should probably build it every game. In the early game, you sacrifice a little bit of dmg compared to ghostblade but you should still be able to win lane with bc. The health will keep you alive esp vs true dmg opponents and 20% cdr is a ton. Can also buy a tiamat in between there if you feel you need more dmg. BC also helps transfer riven into the mid game.

2. Spirit Visage is still a viable option as it is gold efficient and offers really good components. However Maw and Scim are most often times going to be the way you want to go. The AD and MR offered by Maw is huge not to mention Moar armor pen, and the passive will give you more sustain than SV however you have to reach low health for it. Scimitar is also useful with the QSS tons of AD and lifesteal.

3. Although it definitely makes sense, it was a little surprising that everyone had the same exact answer of early hexdrinker vs ap match ups. SO DO IT

4. Deadmans is good for vsing a team without a lot of crit, and the moves peed passive is good on riven and helps with flanking. Randuins is good for the crit Champs like Yasuo, trynda, and some ADC aoe slow is really nice too.

5. This guy is still not someone you really wanna fight. I'd definitely recommend reading all the posts for this one but basically you want to kill him pre 6. Nidalee posted the build of BC&gt;Lifeel steal item&gt; Lord Dominik's Regard (LW)&gt;life steal item with lucidity somewhere in there. Try to roam.

6. It's more of preference. I personally like mid because most of your apponents are squishy but will often have cc to lock you down. Again hexdrinker is good here and QSS for Champs like Annie or Tf. Jungle riven is doable and fast Qing the minions is how u do it. However you should look to get rolling early as you fall off if you dont.

1907	czj4l3j	czj4sy4	MapPorn	Are there any blacks-only, Coloured-only, or Asian-only towns in South Africa? I know the Bantustans were supposed to be monolingual black-only territories, but they were explicitly the product of apartheid.	There are many blacks-only and coloured-only towns but not on purpose. These towns simply haven't had any non-blacks or non-coloureds move into them. Orania and Kleinfontein are intentionally whites-only. If you're looking for examples: here's the town of [Bullettrap](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/364006) - a 100% coloured town in the Northern Cape and here's the town of [Allandale](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/276132) - 100% black. I have never found a 100% Asian town in South Africa, because, like Whites, they are never a majority in any municipality and therefore when apartheid ended a lot of non-Asians moved into their areas because they were of a better economic standing. Very few whites have, for example, moved into Soweto or Tembisa because they're usually from a better economic background and Soweto is generally poor

1915	czivtte	czj9aan	AskReddit	"my husband is 240 lb, and he's strong and very muscular underneath the fat because of his job, but he's still fat.  he's always been fat as long as i've known him.  he's got the beer gut, the man titties, the jelly rolls.

i'm 110 lb.

honestly, he's hot.  he doesn't have to be a skinny doe-eyed model to be hot.  his look and his style is... really good.  being fat is honestly part it.  that's ok.

i can speak for any skinny person porking with a fat person when i say, if you love the person, you're gonna love the body.  if you don't love the person, you're just there for the body, and if the body isn't your cup of tea, why the hell are you there in the first place.  my guess is that fat women will put every effort into their appearance and being sexually pleasing to try to ""make up"" for being fat.  but again, if you love the person, you're going to love the body.  they shouldn't have to make up for it at all in a loving relationship.

i can say for the record, my SO never ""retains"" body odor when he washes up, and doesn't have a bad odor to begin with.  different people have different hygiene habits, fat and skinny alike.  i can't speak for fat women, but fat men can be a great fuck.  they have a lot of thrusting power behind the d.  just had sex an hour ago and i'm a happy camper.  high five!"	Very well spoken. It always worries me when someone focuses on the physical attributes of someone they have been in a relationship with.

Natural 5's can come from heroic for sure. Not sure about heart summons. But they probably do too. Basics can only go for 1-4 stars IIRC.

On natural vs fused, naturals have generally higher stats than fused, hence why they are stronger. You'll see this once you get to compare your first natural and fused. You are guaranteed a natural 5 start in a month of playing.

1956	dgyh84g	dgyx9zn	BlueJackets	"When you need an anchor on your blue line to eat tough minutes against the opponents top skaters, Jack Johnson is... not it.

But playing middle tier minutes with a great skater like Savard alongside him, he's looked better. As has been said, he is almost certain to be our expansion draft loss, and that is just fine. He will do good there, could be their captain and possible face of their franchise at the start. Good for him.

As for us, we have Nutivaara and Carlsson who can play the minutes, and Ryan Murray is simply a lot better than Johnson with the puck. He makes better passes and reads the play better (although admittedly not as durable). Subtracting Johnson and adding Carlsson makes us better defensively. Plus if Johnson is picked, it means Anderson (who will likely replace Dubinsky in a few years) and Karlsson won't be. 

I'll thank Jack for his service. I won't pretend I always liked his game but I will sincerely appreciate the effort he gave this team and city. "	"I wholeheartedly disagree with so many things in this comment. First, if you offered Ryan Murray a million dollars to do this with a puck he couldn't: https://twitter.com/NHL/status/848695374076420096/video/1 . The only thing Murray is better at is stretch passing and stick checking. His positioning needs a ton of work. His speed is light years behind Johnson especially since the knee injury.

Second Nuti and Carlsson at this point in their careers could never skate the minutes and responsibilities JMFJ does. Do you wanna see Nuti on the PK? I don't. Maybe you didn't notice that sometimes Nuti played 10 minutes a game because he was flat out not being defensively responsible. I like the guy as a future play maker but come on. Carlsson is good and promising but far from a sure enough thing to bail on what was an elite shut down pairing this season. Defensemen aren't nearly as plug and play as offensive guys.

Third Josh Anderson is a winger, so he can't replace Dubinsky ever. I love Wild Bill but he, and even Andy are 10x more replaceable than Johnson. Perhaps you haven't heard about this Dubois guy we have, or Kolesar, Abramov, Milano, Stenlund, "

Star Citizen will take the best of all possible worlds, ranging from a permanent, persistent world similar to those found in MMOs to an offline, single player campaign like those found in the Wing Commander series. The game will include the option for private servers, like Freelancer, and will offer plenty of opportunities for players who are interested in modding the content. Unlike many games, none of these aspects is an afterthought: they all combine to form the core of the Star Citizen experience.

1978		dkzy9fs	AskThe_Donald		"Net neutrality basically means that the people who control the guts of the internet have to treat all data the same. It doesn't matter if the packet contains a few seconds of a Netflix movie, some text headed for Reddit, a gamer's data, Skype call, encrypted mystery numbers — it all goes in the same pipe as everything else; it all moves at the same pace.

The reason this is so important is that ""the people who control the guts of the internet"" are now a very small number of very large corporations who would really like to inflict *horrible* things on us, but are being prevented from doing it by these rules. ""Oh, you wanted to Skype your family? Let's just slow that data to a crawl so it basically looks like you're tunneling through 1995. But if you upgrade to our *premium* plan, which includes Turbo Skype, only from Verizon, you'll enjoy crystal clear quality for only $19.99 more a month!"" Basically, without net neutrality, your ISP would receive legal permission to digitally torture you for money.

The better solution would be to have robust competition, so if your ISP ever tried this, you could switch to one of the many others. Then we probably wouldn't need net neutrality rules. But right now, many people only have a couple ISPs they can use, so that's not much help.

Net neutrality is not a philosophically ""correct"" thing to do, because it represents a lot of intrusive regulation in the tech sector where that's not desirable, but in the situation where we find ourselves, it's better than the alternative, which is frankly horrifying."

You can't get rid of a CI!)

I don't agree with the thought of *fixing*. It's a way of improving your life. You may not think that and that's fine.

By giving the children a choice do you mean having a final say on it?

* Point two
Actually we get that alot ""oh you can't drive! You're deaf!"" ""Oh, sorry you can't be a server, you're deaf."" Etc. Usually (at least for me) causes a ""I'm-gonna-fucking-prove-you-wrong"" attitude.

You're talking as ""we"". If that happened to you, I'm sorry. Dumb people say dumb things.

If that causes you that attitude, GOOD. But don't do it because of them. Do it for you. Prove it to yourself because at the same time you're showing them that you are capable and this disability does not define you.

* Because of the school I went to and parents and employers etc. It was basically the only way my high school would let me finish my junior and senior years and my parents wouldn't let me go to a Deaf school or learn sign language.

That and they aren't cute, but that's the last and least important of my reasons.

how did they not help? are they're the ones behind the ear or the smaller ones that goes inside?"	"I mean just let children be part of the discussion, it's irreversible and ultimately their body, their life. I sure as he'll also disagree with sheltering deaf kids in a Deaf bubble (but that may be my mainstream upbringing speaking) 

School I went to was a private school and they were very much anti-signing (so we're my parents) my parents refused to let me learn sign language because they said me being deaf was God's way of punishing me for being gay. And alot of employers are surprisingly not that educated on Deaf people, which is reasonable if they don't see Deaf people all that often.

Yeah hearing aids basically helped me sort of hear sounds but for them to be even remotely intelligible I had to basically put all my concentration and effort into it and so it was more a hinderence then a gift."

Miracle was the top dog mid during OG's previous roster, the literal first 9k, but despite his skill he doesn't look anywhere near as good on Liquid. It's all in the captaining and decision making, and that is where Fly is the best.

People trash talked Fly when he got removed from Secret, where he wasn't leading, but clearly there was more to him than just his play making."

I'd say the chance of the latter happening is exponentially better than the chance of the former right now.

Since when is linking to an article ""circlejerking"" and ""sucking each other's dicks?""

I get Silver's appeal, and yes, there was the embarrassing Unskewed Polls fiasco. But IMO, the article I linked raises some legitimate criticisms of Silver's analysis that aren't just ""boo hoo, he's picking the candidate I don't like."" Silver's a smart guy, but he's not infallible."

2035		czj4sf6	Truecels		"Humans as well as other animals have more 'biologically programmed' mating strategies, but basically they divide into two categories
1) have as many children as much as you can and with as many man as possible so that your children will be as diverse as possible. 

This is the main mating strategy for women in underdeveloped societies: south america, africa, etc.

2)pair-bonding strategy. Have one make that will take care of you and your offspring and offer him sexual exclusivity so that he will be sure the children are all his and will take care of all of them and stay with you. This makes the man to feel so-called 'love' for the woman. Marriage was invented for this specific strategy. It was invented to encourage people to use this mating strategy so that man will not focus on competing for women but focus on science, writing and advancing of society. That is why societies that were more traditional managed to become much much more technological advanced than the ones that had the 'fight each other to pump and dump women'.


If a woman already had sex with many men, she knows subconsciously that the pair-bonding strategy is less and less likely to work for her as man are programmed to bond with females who are only theirs because they do not want to end in a situation to provide for a child that is not his.
In this case the instincts of the woman 'switch' to the first strategy- be pumped and dumped by the most strong, the most seductive men and have as many children as possible to make sure at least some of them survive. She needs to have more children because without a man to provide for her a lower percentage of children will have chances at survival. Thus she becomes what we call today a 'slut'.

This two types of strategies were vastly studied and appear in animals and also in humans.


In a civilized society a 'paid-bonding strategy' is the norm and allows the society to advance. 
A society that has 'pump-and-dump' as a strategy will become more and more a shit-hole. This is the reason that black communities in US live in such poverty and violence. This is their strategy. Be aggressive, fight other men, prove to women you are violent enough to survive to have a chance to pump her.

The whites had a very different strategy and created a very different societies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory

Read about a very interesting species where males with different mating strategies have different colour (a proof that the mating strategy also has genetical factor)

And to be honest, it's not like Grim Dawn has a narrative worth stopping for either. 	I actually really like dialogue in RPGs as long as its not a huge presentation like in a theatre play.

If you want a moment that I can remember, I have vague memories of a lot of Georgia moments. I kind of remember hearing about Georgia winning the SEC in 2005, I remember that Georgia played Hawaii in the 2007-08 Sugar Bowl and that I thought it was funny because Hawaii is the next state after Georgia alphabetically, and I remember seeing the end of the 2010 Georgia-Florida OT game and being disappointed that Florida won. I remember a little of the 2012 SEC Championship game and Georgia being ranked #3, but I didn't fully grasp how close we came to greatness until recently.

But you probably don't care about all that. The first really memorable thing in my CFB-watching experience was watching Georgia hang half a hundred on Spurrier's Gamecocks in a small Mexican restaurant. It was glorious."

Being prepared to actually call it as he sees it and not buying into the rule of players toeing the line with the politically correct answer doesn't create an obligation to come up with a solution. 

Same way that you could ask players what they think would happen if some indigenous draftee does a war dance in their first game and dedicates it to his inspiration Goodes post game, 95% of players would tell you that there is nothing controversial about that yet you can be sure this would attract plenty of controversy regardless of whether or not it should. 

Edit: I'll go a step further and suggest the 95% are the problem. You can't fix a problem if your not prepared to admit it exist. It is the ones who openly say there is an issue who open the door to discussing how to fix it... and the persin with the solution is not necessarily the person calling out the problem. "	"See I understand your point, I just really doubt the motivation. This is not some murky little understood phenomenon. You don't need to be playing at a footy club to realise homophobia still exists. 

Literally nobody is pretending homophobia is extinct. They may insinuate we should be better than that, but that is not the same thing. The fact footy is traditionally a boys' club and not easily overturned, is something well understood, hence the league's focus on women's involvement, broader community involvement, and the general talk of homosexuality etc.

So if everyone understands the problem, and he isn't offering a solution, then that raises the obvious question; why speak on this in the first place? Well we all know he loves the sound of his own voice, so that's a good starting point in answering that question."

If people want more lanes open, they need to buy more to justify it. As it stands, ""the system"" generates schedules that are tinkered with as little as possible (usually to meet availability demands or to be below scheduled hours limitations set above store level); these schedules are meant to reflect customer flow as best as possible.

And ideally, if you see more than two people in line, they're supposed to be getting salesfloor people to the front to help, though that doesn't always work promptly.

This was followed by thirty five daily radiation treatments with seven simultaneous weekly chemotherapy treatments that ended just before Christmas.

Cancer was stage four. Five year survival is around 60%. It

After a couple of PET scans,  no sign of it returning.

Went from 240 to 170 pounds.

Still have trouble eating.

Gotta be honest here- it sucks!

Worst was right after treatments finished.  I just got sicker and sicker.

Did not need to get a feeding tube.

People tell me I got off easy.  Glad I didn't have a worse time of it.

I'm 63.  Diagnosed a year ago on August 17th.

Not back to my new normal yet. Having gum problems, and post radiation dentistry is said to be very problematic.

The worst thing has been the constipation, so make sure he takes a dose of Miralax every day.

Islam gave women the right to choose their spouse without force, unrestricted education, allowed women to actively fight in wars, allowed women to become scholars (in fact, the oldest University that's still running was founded by a Muslim woman, 12 centuries ago. Furthermore, Muslim women were given the right to work, and wives were also given the right to work and gain income (in fact, the husband is forbidden to touch his wife's hard-earned money), Muslim women were allowed to not take their husband's family name upon marriage, plus the husband's parents isn't the wife's responsibility to take care of. And trust me, I'm only getting started. Say what you like about the corrupt Muslim leaders and scholars who bastardize Islam's teachings, then I'll agree with you.

Women being treated as second-class citizens is mostly down to the fall of the Ottoman empire (at least between Persia and the Levant), which made the breeding ground of corrupt scholars and leaders destroying what's left of those area's moral integrity. Saudi Arabia is down to the appointment of a corrupt tribe with the help of the British.

If you have actually cared to read the links I posted, then you know that Islam (in it's untainted form) is totally against rape of all kinds. Why did you ignore it? Y u do dis, man?"	you probably know more about it than me since you are muslim, so i'll just believe you. sorry dude, just obviously, this shit makes people angry and feel irrational hatred.

Most of the time, the landlord can re-rent the place before then, at which point you owe them everything from when your lease began until they get it re-rented."	"How would they collect it, by trying to sue me? Does that happen often or is it not really practical?

Basically I have no issue helping the landlord find someone to replace me, I've done that before. I don't think it's fair to be on the hook for $12,000 (assuming $1,000/month which is cheap) for a place you haven't spent a night in.

The other thing is that I'd probably be renting in an apartment building, so the landlord might be some random company rather than a real person who is willing to work with me. In that case is it common for them to sue people to try to collect money? Do they have any authority to use collections agencies?"

2195		dkzreo0	Advice		An excuse is standing somewhere between you and the next step you need to take. – If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way.  If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.  This may be tough to accept, but it’s the truth.  Stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  The only person who can truly hold you back is you.  So no more excuses – it’s time to change.  It’s time to choose what’s best for YOU.  Oftentimes when we feel stuck, we are waiting for something magical to happen.  We wonder when the winds will change in our favor.  We do this instead of embracing the present and admitting the change we need to make.  What is keeping you from stepping forward?  If not fear of failure, then what?  Insecurity?  Laziness?  What is your excuse?  We all have one.  And when we focus on our excuses more than our steps forward, we walk in a circle and fall into the familiar pit we call “Stuck.”

&gt;Why are you so insecure about your dick? I'm seriously asking

Dude responds:

&gt;wat, no I'm not... I am about everything else though... the dick is the only good thing on me, that's not the point... He implied that I said ""blacks don't have bigger dicks/ women usually don't even like big dicks"" because I have a small dick and I was saying that because I'm butthurt . By posting my 8 + inch penis I provided proof that I'm not saying that because I'm butthurt about my small penis because I clearly don't have one and that the reason I said that is because I have seen how women feel about my penis. I provided proof for my personal experience to back up my claim. It's not about a fucking dick."

2204	dgwdvsa	dgywo82	EARONS	Why do we assume that he was the one who made the map? Notebooks often get used by several people. Perhaps his mom or dad or older sibling had used this particular notebook before. Or perhaps those pages were dropped by someone totally unrelated to the crimes. 	the homework handwriting matches the writing on the back of the map. 
2205	dkzddx2	dkzq3od	TibiaMMO	What place is Shargon's hideout? never heard of it	I don't even know if that's really the name of it. It's the two floors under oramond furies, which is the last part of the dark trails quest. Since it's a mix of furies, dark torturers, undead dragons and some other stuff, it can be pretty reasonable experience as well as profit.
2206	dkyxrxk	dkzrpz5	Shadowverse	...why did you liquify Grimnir? He's still an amazing card. It was more of a love tap than a nerf.	I disagree. The only deck I can see wanting Grimnir now is Dragon, because it can comfortably ramp to 10 and use it as an effective boardwipe. Not having the reach to close out the game was much harder than just a lovetap and I wouldn't be surprised to see it dropped from the crafts that have better 3 drops.

I'm usually not very good at all at predicting that stuff, but it was no surprise at all.  I think it's because he kept going on about how he has a very good memory and how he was able to pull up a wealth of information at a moment, like Sherlock.

My annoyance was much less slight though when I worked at a restaurant where the chef/owner pronounced it like that. I mean she had a very grating personality in general, so that definitely added to it. Still though, this is a recipe she wrote, and when the chipotle powder she uses for it runs out, she's the one who orders more, and when customers complain about it, she's the one they talk to, meaning that she has to have heard the correct pronunciation hundreds of times throughout the time she's had it on the menu but she just doesn't care.

&gt; A team of researchers from Italy&amp;#039;s University of Trieste and the Cambridge Graphene Center recently made significant headway in this direction when it successfully demonstrated that untreated graphene can be used to interface with neurons without damaging their integrity.

This YouTuber is extremely talented with makeup, came close to winning the NYX face awards last year.

* which state they live in
* male or female for gender
* which way someone votes

It's okay to only want responses from a particular group of people (Americans, Males / Females, 18+); you just need to make sure that you are requesting those things in the demographic section of your survey title.

The other thing that didn't make sense is why use backup members if there are only 4 venues. There are enough elite ten members even if you include ishiki and erina out. "	I don't think it requires them to be in groups, I think that it's just that they all wanted to go

We shall not speak of finding clothes that fit that shape.	Yeah, finding a shirt that fits giant boobs and then a tiny everything else made me look like I was wearing a tent.

That's some insane implication by lucas wtf."
2259	dgybuvx	dgyviir	Mcat	"To offer a different perspective, i strongly disagree with this poster. I've routinely seen individuals with no major scientific background, including humanities and engineering students score extremely high. Engineering students would have some familiarity with MCAT physics and chemistry, but that's it. As a matter of fact, a significant % of the highest scorers in our schools MCAT club is encompassed by the aforementioned cohort.

At the end of the day, how you score relies almost exclusively on your critical thinking capabilities and mental processing speed."	It's great to have differing view points on this and I feel a little more confident after reading your comment. Do you think the Kaplan review books would suffice to cover basic content knowledge?

2271	dgyp4ym	dgyws4m	BattleRite	There is still sustain in his M2, just on the round 3 battlerites instead. Wasn't it always from a battlerite? Because I'm missing something if it used to be baseline.	"You bring up a good point, so I should clarify. Shifu used to get sustain on his M2 from his first battlerite, not his 3rd, and it used to heal for 10 (at 3 stacks), whereas now it only heals for 6. Also, his ""Poised to Strike"" battlerite used to give him 3 stacks after his counter was procced, so that was an extra 10 if you were lucky. Finally, his ""Mantra"" battlerite used to heal himself and allies for 16 health when the move was cast (not procced), and now it has to be procced and it only heals for 12. These 3 changes together have seriously hurt him, in addition to ranged champions doing a lot more damage."
2272		czj9shy	WeAreTheMusicMakers		"When thinking about compression, the knobs or settings all work in a specific order. 

*The first thing to consider is threshold, which marks the decibel level at which the compressor starts to work. All noises that are under the threshold will be unaffected, whereas all over will be compressed.

*The second thing is the ratio. This defines the angle of compression after the threshold is reached. 1:1 is no compression while 1:infinite functions the same as a 'brick wall' where nothing will ever get louder than the threshold. If you have a DAW, I recommend downloading the Tokyo Dawn Records Feedback Compressor because it demonstrates this function visually while music is playing through it. 

*Attack is the third thing to consider, and defines how fast it takes for the compressor to start working when the sound goes over the threshold.

*Release is the fourth thing to consider, and defines how long the compressor will keep working while sound is above the threshold. 

*Makeup is the last thing to adjust, and is used to raise the gain of the signal after it has gone down after squeezing (compressing) the audio signal. If you don't use makeup, the overall volume will go down. 

I'm unfamiliar with the terms hold and analysis for a compressor. 

Think of a sound's waveform, then imagine it going through a tube. Using compression is like making the tube smaller, so the loud sounds get quieter. You adjust the attack and release to create the 'punch' people normally associate with a compressor. 

Edit: apparently I'm close with the definitions, but still very wrong. /u/onespaceman 's article clarifies the fine details of how what I said was wrong. "

There is definitely nothing wrong with feeling that way. You are genetically attracted to people with different features.

There is literally nothing I--or any other woman--could do according to your belief that would convince you that they are anything other than brainwashed and that makes your stance inarguable and, ultimately, screwed up because it just puts you in a place where you are telling women what to like or think--the same as how things are now. You're not progressive; you're just patronizing and controlling. "	"You're free to sexually fetishize yourself being murdered, if that's what you're worried about. But it doesn't make it healthy or right. 

I'm sorry you're angry, but what does it matter what I, a woman who has seen many more years, think about you? For the record you seem like an incredibly bright person who has great potential to do some real good in this world. So then, what is missing? Why do you feel the need to come in this space seeking validation for lifestyles and ideals that we've already personally experienced and/or extensively studied before you were even born?

2311	dkz7dr3	dkznfly	Bowling	"> I don't necessarily need to stick with Storm/RG, just how things worked out. I used to throw a ton of Hammer and EBI.

Fair enough!

> I find myself throwing the Daredevil and Hyroad the most, and I love both of those pieces.

Cool. Both of those look great (I own a HyRoad, and have considered adding a DD to my setup also), so no objection there. Opens the path to dropping the !QTF also.

> So just for confusion sake. I'm likely going to pull the !QTF out of my bags and buy a DDTrick or GB2.

thumbsup.jpg

> I don't have much info on either, so is there one you would recommend over the other?

Given that you have a mostly Storm/RG bag (and more importantly a Dare Devil already), I'd lean towards the DDTrick (bigger cover, same core) for that reason. GB2 should be similar just a board or two less overall hook vs the DDTrick.

> And if I decide I want to bowl more tournaments I should pick up a monster hook ball.

Agreed.

> Can you also recommend an Asym monster to pick up?

The Mako and Sure Lock are pretty much leading the field right now for the asym hook monster slot. The new No Rules Exist from RG could also be good, but haven't seen enough from that ball to have as strong of an opinion on it. I personally have a Sure Lock for that slot and love it."	Just to butt in, Sure Lock then ball down to DDT seems like a great combo, granted I've had the DDT for just a week.
2312	dkz2oay	dkzubj6	TheMassive	"Ok, so I keep seeing this sentiment (in this thread and others) that being annoyed with our current standing and our performance this year is silly and foolish.

Can someone tell me how fighting for a playoff spot over midway through the season in Berhalters highest PPG year ever is a good thing? No?

So can we stop acting like thats a good thing? The sky's not falling. Its also not raining Supporter's Shields and MLS Cups, and its ok to want that. Stop insulting and putting down fans who are frustrated with mediocrity when this season is exactly that. People see teams like Chicago and TFC who have been historically terrible at the top of the table, and they want the Crew to be there. But fuck them right?

I don't want to hear about point totals unless you can look me in the eye and tell me that 6th in the east (out of 11 teams, so right in the middle) is a *good* team and we should be happy to be in this position. Wanting an above average team instead of average ISN'T A BAD THING, so stop treating fans who want and expect that like they're bad fans."	This. 👏
2313	dkuqx40	dkzxf7d	Insurance	It's ok to budge on negotiations, the fact is that you talked him down at least a bit, that is what is important. Good luck! At this point, nothing you can do but wait.	Hate to bother you but I have a quick question. How long is the interview process ?

2316	dgvsjp0	dgywww0	LosAngeles	"Geez Angelinos, give old Elon a break. People said all the same things about starting an electric car and space company.


If it reduces traffic and emissions, or even just one, this will be worthwhile. "	"Electric cars and spaceships and an engineering problem. Elon is an engineer. He is perfect to solve those problems.

Transportation planning is a well, planning problem. Its a different field. He has no idea what is going on in that world. Speeding up a tunnel digging machine? Fantastic, that's an engineering issue and I hope he makes improvements. But turning that, into what is shown in the video does not follow. 

This is also true of the Hyperloop. Can he be the person to turn his sketch into technology? Absolutely. Will that invention solve a transportation problem? Not likely in the real world due to many constraints he has no understanding of. "

2326	cziwpyq	czj8x8a	AskReddit	True, this will be one of the last jobs taken by automation, mainly because of how delicate some of the work is, and the lack of maneuverability in modern robotics.  	"Not delicate, really. My job is a lot of banging on shit until it comes loose, it's the troubleshooting that would be the hard part. Someone has to program the automated process. That someone can't think of every possible situation. Most ""troubleshooting charts"" that you'll find on places like AllData or whatever eventually boil down to ""uhhh try to send it back to the manufacturer"". Troubleshooting oftentimes requires a kind of finesse that you can't really teach. Sometimes that ""finesse"" is just wanging it with a hammer, but it's also knowing when that's appropriate."

I recently switched from Comcast to Frontier Fiber.

ping to west went from ~40 to 19, ping to central is around 34 and ping to east...lol, who the fuck cares about NAE.

^^^/shots ^^^fired"	"Lol, 

I have Mediacom. 100 mb down 20 mb up. 

There are only two (actually 3 isp's) here in the Desert. Two that matter (Mediacom and Verizon) the third is a local isp, but speeds are not their strong suit. 

I have the fastest consumer grade connection available. For 70 bucks, it's not bad. 

My ping issues are from having 3 roku's  in the house, which are always on, plus phones, laptops, tablets, etc... 

My pc is hard lined, everything else is wifi. Which, I turn off when my roommate is out. So the roku's, and everything aren't interfering whilst I play. 

But, Mediacom will not dual connect us, and Verizon does not connect on my side of town. So, I pay for everyone else to use my friggin Internet. Which sucks. 

But hey, that's all about to change. I am getting my own place this month (Feb)."

2331	dkzojnb	dkzoxz9	LosAngeles	True. But the downside is having to work 1-2 hours away because cities in IE don't have the high paying jobs that a house that costs this much commands. It's like you give up some on price, but you have to deal with a shitty commute to other counties to afford it.

Honestly though it's not unusual when you have a home grown company to clear out the old guard leaders at some point after it goes public. Often the people that grew it from small to large don't have what is needed to run it from large to massive, or to handle the pressures of a public company.

2385		dgyv4as	worldwonders		"In March 1958, a B-47 bomber took off from Hunter Air Force Base near Savannah, Georgia destined for the UK to take part in a training exercise. While in flight a warning light indicated that the bomb, called an Mk 6, wasn’t secured properly so a crewmen went to check on it. While he was inspecting he accidentally grabbed the release hatch lever instead of a hand-grip to pull himself up. This sent the 8,500-lb. device crashing into the bomb bay doors, forcing them open and plummeting the bomb 15,000 feet below. Fortunately, the nuclear head for the bomb was in a separate location and the bomb was not armed. The bomb detonated on impact, leaving a 75-foot across, 35-foot-deep crater. It destroyed the home and property of the Gregg family of Mars Bluff, South Carolina. The family of six was injured but there was no reported fatalities.

But for most healthy people, it's just allergy-like symptoms.

The fact is that it's unnecessary and expensive to have the mold tested, even for ""black mold"" (*Stachybotrys chartarum*, or *Stachybotrys atra*). All mold infestations should be treated the same, and that's just to remove it yourself. If this is the only spot with mold that you know of, it's likely you can just clean this up and have no problem at all. If it is occurring in multiple places, maybe hire someone to inspect the house for it.

The CDC has a nice guide on how to deal with mold in your home - [you can find it here](https://www.cdc.gov/mold/stachy.htm). I recommend you take a look at that and try removing/treating it yourself before spending unnecessary money getting it tested."	"Thanks for this reply.

2448	dgxakpo	dgyvn0h	FordFocus	For Under 3000, and I may be biased here since this is how I did it. Hit up auctions, see what you can get for 3 grand. I got mine for about 300 + auction fee, it had only done 75k miles, service history right up to 2015. Mk2s would probably be about a grand at the same mileage, maybe just under 2000 for one with REALLY good bodywork. If its your first car, and again, im probably biased, i would consider getting a Mk1, as they're slightly lighter, and the 1.8. its about 115 bhp so not so powerful as to send your insurance skyward, but fast enough you can push her, if youre inclined as such. The only issue with that is, you have to very lucky with the body condition on that one.

Believe me, I would love it if he was the nominee, nothing would make me happier than to put our candidate up against a Socialist for a slam dunk. Kinda like how reddit thinks Rand Paul has a shot at the Republican Nod...

2521		dgz1plj	LetsTalkMusic		Good question. It depends on the song, and how I'm feeling at the same time. For example, whenever I listen to a song by Unwound or Drive Like Jehu, I like to focus on the guitars, and how they sound. Whenever I put on a song by Cocteau Twins or Slowdive, I absorb the instrumentation as a whole. I like to let myself fall into the feeling that a song gives me sometimes, instead of focusing on specific instruments.

The things I have learned from our head maintenance guy about pools you would never want to go swimming again at least in public pools. He had to get certified and had to take classes on how to care for our two pools and he was telling me that the chlorine smell that you smell in pools is not how a pool is supposed to smell. When you smell the chlorine that is how the chemical reacts to people peeing in the pool. So I asked my brother in law who builds pools for a living if it was true and he said yes it's true.

0 wins... discounting your 1 free win.

That deck isn't that clunky, I'd argue. Math is hard and I'm a bit drunk so here's the simplified, perhaps mangled version. You've got 9 cards that are playable by turn 1 and 2 (no stampede, explosive trap, etc, just minions). Drawing 1 of them makes you happy as a hunter. By turn 1 you've got a 43% chance to draw at least 1 of those 9 cards. Excluding 2 drops, you've got a 37% chance to draw a playable 1 drop by turn 1.

Statistically you should've landed a curve pretty often. All you had to do with this deck was stall until you meme them out of the game. What went so wrong?"

2547		dgyy87e	OverwatchUniversity		"You're trying to get back into the game casually right? So treat the game like that. All your post tells me is that your emotions are tied to whether you win or lose. You're saying things a casual player wouldn't. Who cares if the other team has a 3-4 group. Who cares if no one talks? 

Remember that even two perfectly equal teams will have one team lose, and one team win. Sometimes there's a crushing defeat. The other team probably isn't talking either. 

And if you're done using the word casual so haphazardly, group up. Find other people to play with. Some might not be great, but stay with the ones that have synergy with you. /r/OverwatchLFT/"

It's kind of unfortunate that my girlfriend, who is not from NC natively, has told me, ""Sir/ma'am"" is unnecessary and awkward, thus wouldn't want to raise potential children saying it. After some convincing she realized it's a respect thing. But how could anyone find fault in that?

I love your overall gist of ""the majority is not always correct."" It's completely true. I also must realize that where I am for work is in a liberal area of the state. It doesn't necessarily reflect everyone, everywhere, in the state itself.

What irks me most is when I hear younger folks say they want to lose their accent. Why in the WORLD?"	Why would anyone ever want to lose their accent? I don't have an accent, and I'm jealous of all of the rest of y'all!
2585		czjed08	Naruto		"Best Ninjutsu: Kaguya, I mean shes the goddess of chakra

Best Taijutsu: Guys 8 gates

Best Genjutsu: Itachis Tsukuyomi

Best Summoner: Jiraiya with his toads

Best Summon: When Sasuke summons that snake to save himself from Deidara, I don't remember the whole explanation but it saved his life so I'd say its a pretty important one.

Best Hokage/Kage: Hashirama by power but I really liked Minato, I thought his kunai teleportation stuff was really cool.

Best Teammate: Neji :(

Best Character Growth: This could go to so many people but I'm gonna avoid just giving it to the MC and say Gaara.

Best Shinobi: Kakashi, always willing to sacrifice for his village and friends, never afraid to fight to protect what he loves. Very wise and was given the task of trying to guide Sasuke and Naruto which was difficult given ones clan was slaughtered and the other was the nine tails jinchuuriki.

Best Kunoichi: Tsunade, very tough woman and the only female Hokage, one of the three legendary Sannin.

Best jutsu: Madaras Tengai Shinsei based on power, but I did really like Sasuke's rinnegan power in the Boruto movie(Amenotejikara )where he's able to teleport from one space to another in an instant.

Best Arc: Chunin Exams were alotta fun first time around. Either that or the Pain arc.

Best Villian: Tobi, very mysterious and powerful.  I remember being on the edge of my seat during his fight with Minato.  ""I could say I did it on a whim, or that I planned it, or that its war...or that its for peace"" - one of my favorite lines in the series.

Best Fight: This is so hard to choose.  My personal favorite was Kakashi vs Obito in the Kamui dimension.  Animation and emoitions were so high during the fight.  Itachi vs Sasuke is a close second, very tactical fight and a lot of fun to see unfold.

2586	dkzgcgc	dkzozv9	AskReddit	">Nah, fuck it. When I'm a dad, I'm breaking the cycle and letting the colorful language fly.

This is what we've done with our son, He understands that we don't mind if he says any of the words except ""Fuck"" (my wife just wasn't having it) - so he can say ""Bitch, Asshole, Dickhead, Twat"" etc. and we don't care, he understands that this is a unique thing in our family, and that other families consider this kind of language to be a non-starter (especially when we live in Utah, surrounded by mormons). 

So far, we've only had trouble with the school once, when he told some kid who was bullying him to Fuck off, and the school sent home a letter with him explaining the situation which we were supposed to sign and return (To confirm we'd acknowledged the issue). I flipped the damn thing over, and wrote ""My son wouldn't have to use such strong language if that other kid wasn't such a cunt.""

His school doesn't contact me anymore, they go to my wife if they need something.


Edit: To clarify, he did get in trouble for using the ""Fuck"" word, but I wasn't too angry because he was standing up to a bully."	"Weird that your wife stops at fuck, sounds like you're British, guess the culture's different?

As an Aussie, fuck can be one of the least offensive swear words and one of the most versatile. I use it casually all the time, though probably too much."

2608	dgy4lgf	dgyzwvt	AskReddit	"Zig-zag trenches being dug toward the perimeter of Khe Sanh.

I had heard about them, but then I'd heard about a lot of strange things in my first couple of months in-country in Vietnam, 1968. Didn't really register.

One of the weird things about Vietnam was that there was no front line. The enemy, the Viet Cong guerrillas (VC) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) were the topic of conversation, but you never saw them - no dead soldiers, no POWs, no flag on a distant hill that marked their positions. 

That war was the first full-scale war that involved the hide-and-seek kind of warfare we're more used to now. Now the idea of two armies banging it out across a ""front"" seems as strange as the peekaboo! kind of war did to the Korean and WWII cadre that led us in Vietnam.

It stayed weird, even after I got outside the wire a couple of times. I was mostly firing at bushes and trees. We all were. Sometimes the bushes and trees fired back, and sometimes when we went to investigate there'd be someone dead or hurt behind the bushes.

I was wondering if Americans, South Vietnamese soldiers (ARVNs), the VC and the NVA were ALL fighting some kind of plants, triffid warfare. I thought maybe the bushes were shooting both ways, and laughing at us all.

Seemed that way. The enemy was abstract, almost surreal to us. No one knew exactly where he was. 

I was designated as an artillery air observer - I sat in the backseat of a piper-cub-like airplane, or the right seat of an observation helicopter and adjusted artillery from the air on the top of suspected targets that I couldn't see because of all that damned vegetation. Occasionally we got shot at. The rounds came up at us out of more bushes. Never saw any humans.

The Demilitarized Zone north of Hue was lined with Marine ""dye marker"" forts, the biggest of which was jammed 50 miles west of the sea at the juncture of North and South Vietnam with Laos. It was called Khe Sanh, and it was a *huge* Marine base.

Khe Sanh was the low-hanging fruit the US military had deliberately set up to attract major formations of NVA. 

The Viet Minh, the original opponents of the French in Vietnam, had reclaimed half their country from the French at another such base, *Điện Biên Phủ*, in 1954. They had laid siege to the isolated base, dug zigzag trenches toward the perimeter, to allow their infantry to approach the wire safely for a final assault.

I had read about those zigzag trenches. The general leading the NVA assault on Khe Sanh was the same general who won that old battle. I reckon the US command just decided to package up a firebase out in the boonies to look just like *Điện Biên Phủ*, let Giap imagine a replay of his glory days.

Well, he fell for it hook line and sinker, so much so that the Americans were kind of surprised, a little worried. I finally got assigned a flight out to Khe Sanh.

My God. There was this huge base, bunkered in and defended like nothing else I saw in Vietnam. We couldn't have taken that base, if the Marines didn't want to let us in. 

And around it was what used to be jungle but now was a moonscape of bomb and artillery craters. And through the moonscape, I could see them - zigzag trenches heading for the wire. They never made it - always ended in twenty or thirty huge bomb craters.

But that was my first *real* evidence that yes, there were actual human beings out there trying to kill us. And getting killed, too. Lots of them. Someone, many someones dug those trenches - bushes didn't do that. And you could see where they died, blown to smithereens.

I guess that was the idea. It certainly worked. Giap spent a generation of NVA soldiers trying to take that camp. It made ALL the papers in the US. Some mighty scary headlines, but really the issue was never in doubt. All they managed to do was get a couple of battalions up to the wire, where they were mowed down and blown up. They needed divisions of men hitting that wire, and that was *never* gonna happen.

This is a long story about how I finally awoke to the idea that yes, I was actually fighting someone, someone human that is. I mean, I *knew* that before I came in country, but y'know I don't think I believed it.

But those trenches... were monuments to the valor of the men opposing us. Gotta give them that. That was suicidal, crazy.

Besides, their sacrifice was not in vain. Win the battle, lose the war. The Khe Sanh siege, especially the resemblance to *Điện Biên Phủ*, was a major factor in the creation and motivation of the anti-war movement stateside, which eventually took America out of the war. I guess I wasn't the only one who was impressed by those trenches."	"Your story reminds me of a book a read not too long ago called ""West Dickens Avenue"" it is about a Marine who spent 77 days at Khe Sanh.  The author was a part of a mortar team, and he might have been in contact with you.

I also find it interesting how the man who wrote ""West Dickens Avenue"" and yourself have taken vastly different views of the war in general.  John Corbett wrote as if going out to Vietnam, seeing combat, going on patrols, and seeing the things he did was all just par for the course.  Even after seeing the enemy, he always seemed rather detached from it all.

All in all, it was an interesting read, and I recommend anyone who is curious about Khe Sanh to pick it up. "

To elaborate: Sher Khan is losing pilots and cargo in the Bermuda Trapezoid. He tricks Baloo into flying for him by giving him a trophy and declaring him the greatest pilot in the city. There's a comedic portion where Baloo argues with Bossy Cat Lady (whatever her name is) claiming that he won't lose the plane since he's the greatest pilot in the city. The planes and ships were going missing due to Don Karnage putting a giant mirror that tricks pilots into thinking that they're upside down and cause them to crash. Kit and Baloo crash the Sea Duck, fight the pirates, and save the day. Baloo realizes he's been tricked and barges into Khans headquarters, demanding a trophy for Kit as a token of appreciation.

Thatd why people are giving him a hard time, he's one of the higher paid guys for his experience level yet shows no heart."	I mostly agree, but I don't think this exactly shows no heart. I think it shows that he's 19, and under trained.  I don't mean he's lacking skills, I think he's lacking training experience.  PVZ trains with TAM, I bet she gets her ass whooped all the time.  I bet she's been in every imaginable bad position you could be in as a fighter training with those guys, but with Sage...I highly doubt he spends a lot of time getting whooped on his back, or with a big guy on top of him trying to put him to sleep (regardless of how bad it was). This isn't Sage's fault, it's his Dad and trainers.  If they let the kid stay at Tristar longer than a couple of weeks or w/e he did then he'll improve leaps and bounds, he'll be put on his ass by people who truly know what they are doing and gain the confidence needed to work out of bad spots.

2668	czjeqmt	czjeye0	DestinyTheGame	I feel like like I very often outgun rushing shotgunners with my doctrine of passing. I also feel like I have an edge against midrange snipers as well. Although the doctrine is considered an upper echelon primary. I think the main issue is that there isn't much variety in what primaries are effective not that there are no effective primaries. 	"Here's the thing: even if Doctrine, MIDA, and TLW are sort-of-kind-of-okay right now, that still leaves us with:

A) only three competitive options, when the lack of diversity was one of the biggest issues/complaints of year 1 (Thorn/TLW/Hawkmoon/Messenger)

and

B) three options that are *way worse* than the best three options in Y1. 

Doctrine of Passing is nowhere near as good as a Year 1 Thorn. A guy with a Y2 TLW would lose to a guy with a Y1 TLW 100 out of 100 times. It's not even close.

On the other hand, snipers, heavy, and supers (for the most part) haven't changed since year 1, and shotguns are still dominant despite nerfs, so where we've ended up is still only having three competitive primary weapons, except now they're much weaker than before, but everything else maintained it's power. That's pretty broken, IMO."

They can't falsely advertise but they can manufacture a product in a low wage country, finish it in the US and then declare it made in the US. 

Making the address of the factory readily available on the package would let us as the consumers know who is honest and who is not. Once you know the address it would only take a few minutes to figure out how much manufacturing is actually done there and the big one, weather or not they are abusing a visa program.

2680		czjd235	PoliticalDiscussion		"I will attempt to respond to your generalizations with some of my own.

Senator Sanders is promoting many ideas that are seen as hallmarks of the ""college liberal"". Things like universal healthcare, free or reduced tuition, socialism as a viable economic model, etc. The ""college liberal"" does not often find a candidate who shares these ideas with them.

Adults (I'll assume over 40 here) likely have carryovers from the Cold War and what socialism was seen as then. My parents for example, equate socialism with the USSR. While this isn't technically correct, they were both born in the 60s and were brought up being told that the USSR, and therefore communism/socialism, was their enemy. 

They have also seen firsthand the fall of communism/socialism in Eastern Europe and view an attempted return to that as horrible.

Now, again, these are very broad generalizations and I'm basing my thesis for the perceived adult dislike of Sanders on a single issue: socialism.

Many adults like Bernie. Many young people don't like Bernie and his policies. I am one of them. 

Neither young people or adults are monolithic entities. Both can have all sorts of different viewpoints.

Edit: also, some adults may have seen candidates like Bernie come up in the past promoted ideas like his that they approve of, only to watch them fail. They may be disillusioned. "

Set up with an MSR (no supressor) up the road and wait for a clean shot. Shoot the resource truck twice and the whole convoy stops. If you're super pro, you can pop the driver and the truck will stop with a ton of health left. It helps to be about 300m away before engaging to not get immediately steamrolled by the escorts. Then drone over to the stopped convoy, mark everyone, then put the suppressor back on and pick off the remnants. When they're all gone, saunter up and tag the truck.

2709	dgy2l8u	dgyu8ei	AskAnAmerican	Go into more detail, please. I know it's anecdotal, but I don't run across people with anecdotal experience of two systems very often.	"When I was employed and lived in the U.S., I was provided a membership with a local HMO (health maintenance organization) through my employer. Our HMO was top-notch, and the service and facilities were fantastic. It was affiliated with a much larger national HMO (I don't know the details) so I could expect the same nationwide. I would pay a small amount (~$25) to see a GP, and $150 per ER visit, which happened at least twice a summer (DHMTB).  
While that sounds expensive in comparison to not paying anything at all, there is an element of getting something that you are paying for. I am significantly older than a university student, make a good living and I could afford it. I'd prefer to afford it.  
In Australia, the GP visits and ER visits are covered under the national Medicare system. The *overall* (that's important) service and facilities are no where near the quality (but they are absolutely not bad - I am not actually complaining about them). I could purchase private health insurance (and am taxed because I don't have a private hospital policy - my levy was close to $1800 last year) and visit private facilities if I wanted to receive marginally better services at better facilities, but the cost of living in Sydney is so astronomical, that I am quite happy with ""adequate"" government health care. I actually like my GP here quite a bit, am relatively healthy and see no reason to spend thousands more per year for something I won't use. I will need to re-evaluate when I get older, as the cost of private health care increases substantially as one without it for many years chooses to switch."

2717		dgytefr	Vive		"Interleaved: Valve's original reprojection method.  When the frame rate falls below 90FPS, it basically shows you the same frame twice (i.e. drops the application to 45FPS).  This results in a 'ghosting' effect of what you see on the display, but is more comfortable than essentially missing V-Sync, which results in judder.  I'd say it's the least preferred option.

There is a 'force interleaved' option but I cant think of any good reason why one would choose to do so.

Asynchronous reprojection: if the application falls below 90FPS, it will take the last frame and warp the image with updated head tracking information.  So, the application will be running at 45FPS, but the head tracking will remain smooth and thus you wont experience any judder.  Assuming you have an Nvidia GPU or one of the few AMD cars which support it, I'd suggest this as your go-to method.  Note that, because it is only dealing with head tracking, controllers and whatever in the game will still be running at 45 fps.

Always on reprojection: a bit of a weird one, but it basically removes the requirement that the CPU waits for updated tracking information before feeding frame information to the GPU, this freeing up a bunch of CPU time to work on the game.  Try this if you think you are CPU bound.  Don't use it with async, I think it works OK with interleaved."

2750		czjghzc	AskMen		"Why study accounting if you are interested in technical stuff? Why not try engineering? Or Construction Management?

Anyways, I was going to school for economics and pre-law, and once I graduated I took up electrical work with my father and opted out of law school. Best thing that's ever happened to me, but it's hard work, sometimes working with scum people, but the pay is great, and the fact you can work with tools and big equipment all day is awesome. The only things I don't enjoy is being on-call, my hands hurting after work, and the fact that I never know what time I'm going to get home. We work in a very specialized field, so don't take my experience as the majority.

As an electrician, or any trade for that matter, you will never starve; as in no matter where you go, if you do good work there is always a larger demand for work than the supply of skilled electricians/plumbers/roofers etc. 

Don't let the white-collar people fool you...my dad paid for my sister and I's college by running an electrical contracting company. We make better money than a good amount of the office jockeys, but they will always say the contrary.


I would suggest going to school for Construction Management also, while working with a general contracting company doing every trade you can get your hands on. Or specialize in one thing like electric/hvac/plumbing and get out of school and get real work experience.

Good luck, and I'll reply back if you have any questions."

I was well aware that I was not seeing his entire testimony. However, reading his full testimony, I was struck by the fact that he never actually gives an explanation: 

&gt;Q. Investigator Wiegert, did he give you the license plate number for Teresa Halbach when he called you?

&gt;A. I don't remember the entire content of our conversation but, obviously, he must have because I was asking the dispatcher to run the plate for me.

&gt;Q. Did you not trust that Investigator Wiegert got the number right?

&gt;A. I don't -- That's just the way I would have done it. I don't -- It's not a trust or distrust issue.

This is not actually an explanation. If he says at some point that he was verifying information about the case, I haven't been able to locate that statement. Later on redirect, Kratz assigns Colborn this explanation, which Colborn accepts:

&gt;Q. Mr. Strang asked whether or not it was common for you to check up on other agencies, or perhaps I'm -- I'm misphrasing that, but when you are assisting another agency, do you commonly verify information that's provided by another agency?

&gt;A. All the time. I'm just trying to get -- you know, a lot of times when you are driving a car, you can't stop and take notes, so I'm trying to get things in my head. And by calling the dispatch center and running that plate again, it got it in my head who that vehicle belonged to and what type of vehicle that plate is associated with.

He's not talking specifically about this case, he's giving a general explanation of scenarios in which he might call to verify a plate number. In the Halbach case, he'd clearly gotten enough information that he immediately went to follow up on a lead by interviewing Avery. I'm stumped as to how or why he'd have written down Teresa's license plate number separately from the other info about the case he'd have needed to question Steven Avery."

2793		dkzq3cm	ShouldIbuythisgame		"**Earthlock: Festival of Magic** is a chill RPG that's pretty breezy.

**Siralim &amp; Siralim 2** are monster capture games that you can pretty much play indefinitely. They're relaxing games that be focused on or played while winding down for the evening/netflix. The games aren't linked, so you can play either. Siralim 2 has a much more focused narrative and progression system. Siralim 1 is basically ""here are the mechanics, do whatever.""

**Stardew Valley** has been mentioned before, but this game is love. If you haven't played it you should at least check it out. It's similar to Harvest Moon/Rune Factory, though very much a western game.

**Bastion** was great fun and pretty chill. It's kinda action-y, but I didn't struggle with it despite having shitty reflexes. It also has a very soothing narration and ambiance.

**Shadowrun Returns (Original, Dragonfall, Hong Kong)** isn't a difficult game, and it's got an amazing cyberpunk atmosphere. The games are turn based and not particularly hard if you play them on the lower difficulties. The lose condition (you died) just means that you have to restart a mission, and none of your companions die permanently. 

**FEZ** is a charming platformer/puzzler that just oozes style. It's great fun and I definitely recommend it (though it's creator is a real dickhead).

**Decromancer** is a card battle game with an interesting world and a fun premise. The gameplay is really enjoyable if you're into card battles (more like strategic combat, really). No lose condition- failing a battle just means retreating and healing up.

**The Sims 3** is my favorite of the franchise, and you can pick up the expansions really cheap as they go on sale frequently. If you've never played it, I recommend it. You just sort  of dick around with your family of sims and play through a life simulator. None of the expansions are necessary, though I find Ambitions adds the most without changing the way the game plays.

**Mages of Mystralia** is an action-y little RPG where you play a fledgling mage learning her spells. There's a very fun spellcrafting system and the game hasn't been difficult. No scares, and deaths aren't terrible."
2794		czjecvf	FinalFantasy		"Mighty Guard is a must.

If you want to farm early ability points before you get to the final dungeon, Level 5 Death will also be very nice.

White Wind is useful.

But definitely make Mighty Guard a priority, it's easily one of the best spells in the game.

---

When I meant farming, here is a video of the spot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-l0R16u-YU

This is when you get to Castle Bal, a little after you get the Ranger class.  Most people like to max out Rangers because they provide the ability to attack 4 times (8 if dual wielding which I believe was a Ninja ability).  So freelancer with Dual Wield == massive damage (also pretty cheap, avoid this method.  It completely removes the fun out of some fights.)

Late game prior to Neo Exdeath in the final dungeon, you'll fight Movers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdX9xv8V6CA

The title says rare mob, but quicksaving causes them to be the second mob spawn.  This is your late game Abp farm, but it has nothing to do with Blue Magic.

TL;DR:

Mighty Guard

White Wind

Level 5 Death (if you want to max some jobs out early.)"

2800	dgyxich	dgyynkv	MortalKombat	"I went off on a tangent there eh? That was a long ass post I wrote. But yeah I was just explaining my thought process on the whole situation of Mileena's character in this timeline VS the original one.

I might have divulged in fanfiction territory with me talking about how Mileena would ditch Outworld for Earthrealm (had a story in mind when I wrote that) but it was an idea I had should she make the transition to good. The idea being that Mileena wants nothing to do with Outworld (or being Empress) and wants to start a new life in Earthrealm. Of course that would involve Mileena's character undergoing a significant transition and would have to be explained by Raiden telling Mileena what Shao Kahn really saw her as. Fanfiction territory, I know lol. Still would love for that to happen though.

But yeah I agree with you on the Kitana/Mileena feud needing a revamp in this timeline. If the previous timeline had Mileena jealous of Kitana being treated better than her by Shao Kahn and her status of Princess of Edenia and all that stuff, I think it should be flipped around with Kitana being jealous of Mileena's newfound humanity (should she ever become good) now that she's damned in the Netherealm and Mileena is living a new, peaceful life in Earthrealm. There can also be an element to the feud where Kitana see's Mileena as a lesser version of herself that doesn't deserve to live. She would also hate that Raiden took pity on her resurrecting her when she tried to have her killed before so in a sense that would sort of mirror their previous feud where Mileena was jealous of Kahn's preferred treatment of Kitana. Basically it's the perfect role reversal that adds a completely new layer to MK's greatest rivalry.

And there I go again on another tangent lol."	"Haha no worries, man. It's all good. I could shoot the shit about Mileena and MK all day.

Yeah, maybe that idea is a little fanfiction-esque, but it would certainly be a story with a unique twist on Mileena's character. 

I do think the idea of ""flipping"" the Mileena/Kitana rivalry is an interesting concept, i.e., Kitana being envious of Mileena while Mileena is enjoying success either in Earthrealm, or ruling Outworld, or whatever; while Kitana is stuck as a revenant in Netherrealm. A role reversal indeed."

The savings of workers becomes invested.

It is the best arrangement for them, quite obviously, if all other attempted arrangements have not produced as much wealth for them.

And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

> workers do not get their wages from stock prices, they get them from a portion of the value they create for the company. 

You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

> your making it sound as though the workers don't make money for the company, but the capitalists somehow do, even though the capitalists get this money by stealing it from workers like a parasite.

Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

What good is your concept of exploitation if you cannot create a business structure or the like that actually pays workers more. It's worthless, and employees know this.

"	"&gt;It is the best arrangement for them, quite obviously, if all other attempted arrangements have not produced as much wealth for them.

yet this has not been the case. when catalonia was managed by the anarcho-syndicalist CNT, workers got much better conditions from being able to actually decide them. please stop spouting ahistorical garbage.

&gt;And it is fair, because while workers may be producing ""surplus value"" they are doing it with machines they did not pay for, with materials they did not have to buy, in buildings they did not contribute to. Of course there is surplus value being generated, if there were not, they would have to help pay for all those things.

materials mined and collected BY WORKERS, machines built, shipped and used BY WORKERS, in factories and establishments built BY WORKERS. the only relation the capitalist has in this relation is control of capital, they contribute nothing to the actual production of material goods or buildings, and make money by leeching off of their work like parasites.
&gt;You're still changing the topic. Anything invest into Wall Street still goes into the pockets of workers. Even profits coming out eventually turns into consumption and goes into the pockets of workers.

this is in itself irrelevant to my response, and also bullshit. this money goes into wallstreet and doesn't come out. besides, anything invested in wall street came out of the labour of workers, and belongs to the workers, not the capitalists, who contributed nothing. they have no reason to be alienated from their own profits

&gt;Not by stealing at all, by contract with workers. Workers know what's happening, there is nothing dishonest going on, and workers are free to try alternative business structures if they like. But coops, for instance, pay on average 14% less than capitalist businesses, even though they try to create jobs without ""surplus value"" being taken from workers.

contracts mean nothing if the alternative is starvation, and alternatives don't matter if they are all equally shit. coops may not pay higher-up employees as much, but i can tell you that someone working in a coop earns much more than someone working in a sweatshop. coops also ensure better job security for the workers, as they are far less likely to fail. where did you get 14% from, breitbart?"

2825	dkxvqsg	dkzseuo	SubredditDrama	"I think lots of people hold libertarian views, but few identify with the libertarian movement. Those that do are generally the most passionate (and often most delusional). This is reinforced by the fact that the only path to political success is to join or support one of the two major parties, so you have to be really really dedicated to libertarianism to stick with it.

That's how you get people like internet libertarians who don't think GPS was invented by anyone and a candidate stripping on stage at their convention.

I think if we had an actual libertarian party that was on par with the democrats and republicans the majority would be moderate libertarians who don't think taxation is theft or that everyone has the right to own their own ICBMs."	"By many accounts, you're correct

see here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/

Kind of like how advertising works, those multiple McDonald ads are not to make you say hey I want to buy McDicks, no it is to effect your subconscious and make it the first thing your head thinks off when it is looking of food. You don't need a good ad to increase customers you just need an ad."	You make me so mad... I can't even fathom how dumb you are with this comment.

http://www.techtimes.com/articles/112605/20151203/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-sales-tank-but-dev-team-is-very-happy.htm ROTTR's figures for example are nothing spectacular, not even extraordinary, and compared to TR's 8.5 mil sales, these figures are nothing but dismal really.

Most people who use cracks use them primarily because they simply have no means of  affording them due to their national socioeconomic situation, but we've given back in the form of recommendations, videos, reviews, word of mouth to friends, providing, admittedly, a minute but constant and diversified local exposure for the product and those who are able to afford it are perhaps persuaded sometimes to acquire it. 

I'm not trying to say piracy actually helps companies sell their games but, analyzing figures and statistics, it doesn't hurt them nearly as bad as they claim and, in many ways, provide, if nothing else, at least a discernible and reliable form of local advertising. 

We are just the easiest target to blame horrible sales figures on. "

This a guide to comprehensive women's reproductive health that includes accurate abortion facts alongside milligrams needed for a DIY pill abortion if your state doesn't have great access. Also it explains risks/benefits of all abortion procedures. I have taken the Mifepristone and Misoprostol mix at planned parenthood more than once and it has always worked well although you basically miscarry at home which is uncomfortable. I've also had a D & C and am not sterile by any means.

If she needs any first person accounts of either procedure, do not hesitate to contact me."	Also the price of abortion goes up the longer she waits. With my medication abortion pills it was $600 all inclusive with pre op and post op care including ultrasounds. I actually need to correct my previous post. My actual medical procedure at PP was vacuum aspiration, not a D &amp; C. The procedure itself took less than 5 minutes in stirrups similar to a Pap smear. All together that procedure took about 5 hours with consent, pre op, Valium distribution, procedure, then 1 hour post op monitoring. Medication abortion took about 3. You take one pill in office then 2 at home the next day and you bleed heavily for a couple of days, including expelling the fetus. The surgical method was easier and bled less, but more invasive and gave me more anxiety than just medications and experiencing a very heavy period for a couple of days followed by bleeding for about another week or so.

2850	dkza5lh	dkzrwot	DBS_CardGame	"I actually picked this card today because of how much I *don't* like it. So to clarify, this card can't be played after combos are anything like that, it's pretty much a 0 cost 6k combo for red cards.

My gripes with this card is that it's really not that much better than any other combo card. Offensively, it's for most parts the same as any 0 cost 5k combo. 

Let's say you attack a 10k with another 10k and you play this bumping up your card to 16k. If they commit 5k, you win, but you would've already won the tie if you had just put down a 5k. To beat you they need to put down a 10k, which is the immediate next level, which also has the same result as a 5k combo.

The only utility this card has outside of instances of battle cards not having powers divisible by 5k is defensively. And that's pretty weird for a red card too. Only defensively does this card act like a 0 cost 10k. I mean, that's kind of neat, but I'd think any 0 cost 5k Battle card would be useful more often.

Changed my life when I was in that spot too. Good luck buddy. "	The acai life 🤙🤙🤙
2875		dkzs3uf	ElysiumProject		I have asked this twice in the last week and seen 2 others ask in that time, they don't appear to give a shit.
2876		czjgh1z	ShinyPokemon		I think... it might be because you had such high expectations for this method. 800 eggs are a lot compared to some successful hunts on here but it's not even that bad. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if I go over 1k without a shiny. So... you should just keep hatching, your silver Eevee will come out eventually. 
2877		dgywe8r	The_Donald		Put some ice on that. 
2878	dgycc3x	dgyyeuw	AsianBeautyRehab	"Sheet masks. I have so many that I'm genuinely afraid to count them. And every time I say I'm gonna use one, I end up not.

Eyeshadow. Yes it looks pretty, yes it would be a nice color for me, but now often will I use it?

Lip balm. It's always the same thing; I lose it, buy another one, and then I find the one that I lost. I do the same thing with USB cables.

Chica & Chico Beta-Salic. Didn't do anything for me. I purchased it as part of a set so it isn't a total loss though. The Astazet is wonderful.

Pore strips. Just no. Whyyy did I ever think they were a good idea.

Any sort of peel off or modeling mask. I just can't stand how they feel on my face."	"&gt; Lip balm. It's always the same thing; I lose it, buy another one, and then I find the one that I lost. I do the same thing with USB cables.

For both lip balms and usb cables, I used to  have the same issue. Now I keep one in my work bag, one in my purse, one on my night stand, one on my desk. And I leave them there. Since I've stopped moving them around, I no longer lose them and I always have one when I need it."

2880	czjfm3o	czjg8so	TrueReddit	The recent brinkmanship and lack of compromise do not necessarily come from a two-party system, however. They are due to the separation of power, specifically between the executive and the legislative branch in the United States. If we have a two party system, but the party in power can have total control over policy making, then there is no brinkmanship and obstructionism.	Remember those two years from 2009-2011 when there was a democrat in the white house, democrats in congress, and democrats in the senate, and the affordable care act barely passed even with many concessions to the republicans?

2891	dkznl47	dkzo5og	Unexpected	Oh no, I do respect Bugatti's aerodynamic design. Especially because of just how old it is. I remember when it first came out, how absolutely crazy the figures were.	Someone earlier on was saying that the egg shape made for good aerodynamics though. I'm asking why it's the only hypercar that uses that design if that's true. 
2892	czj75j1	czj7if0	AskReddit	Step one, start with the yard.	Step two: advertise on grindr

[Tam's Starship Sheet](http://starwars-unknownalliances.wdfiles.com/local--files/files/Starship%20Character%20Sheet.pdf) (Pdf warning)"	Thankyou for this link, it has some which helps.
2894	czj1e6v	czj4za3	BabyBumps	I had two miscarriages before my son was born a few weeks ago and I really struggled with anxiety at the beginning of the second and third pregnancies. People mean well by encouraging you to think positively and to avoid worrying, but it's also okay if you can't. Our thoughts alone don't make things happen -- and they certainly don't end pregnancies. Pregnancies often end because something has gone wrong early in the deeply complex process of building a new person. Miscarriage is a tremendously sad experience, but it's not the result of worry or anxiety or stress. Those things aren't _good_ for you, but lots of healthy babies are born to lots of anxious moms (myself included). Releasing yourself from that pressure to not worry might actually make you worry less...at least that was my experience. Wishing you the best! 	"Thank you. This and a previous comment saying something similar has helped. I can just hope for the best and try again if it doesn't work. I read a quote a couple of days ago, ""Not being happy or excited now isn't going to save you from what might happen."" "
2895		czjauq4	AskReddit		Google-searching stuff back in the early 2000s. 
2896		dgysnzb	SquaredCircle		That cannonball is ridiculous.

Ano yun, gusto niyo reward? hahaha"	haha troo dat mah dawg
2898	dgvsxof	dgyujz2	MkeBucks	I defended him all year but the last few weeks has been tough. He needs to play with Giannis and not in place of Giannis like he did the majority of the season. Kidd played them together late in the season but it still didn't work out (I think his shot was busted by then). Defenses still respect him though and having him on the court actually helped spacing because he was never afraid to shoot. I think some team desperate for spacing might convince themselves that they can help him get back to his just-sub .40 shooting. 	Yep to all of that.
2899	czjcdia	czjcj11	AMA	What got you in the situation you're in now?	Laziness and being a wuss for not switching colleges.
2900	dkzqp12	dkzqun5	FireEmblemHeroes	You could always give him TA/raven tome. The extra defense combined with the damage reduction from TA and Raven means that he can sort of tank colorless and green. Either that or keep his default tome (which is great for supporting), give him a rally and maybe a different C skill (Hone, Fortify, Drive Attack, etc.) and he turns into a decent team buffer/support. 	Maybe I will look into it when my other units have their builds finished. With the switched rates I'll maybe finally pull a Roy.
2901	czif5oi	czjei0t	DestinyTheGame	[verwijderd]	"I'm not really worried about my k\d. It won't change anything in game. It's just a shitty game mode for something like IB where you need to play a lot to get great drops.

I completely agree with you though, it needs to be clash so its not so fireteam oriented."
2902		dkzor0j	KSU		As accurately as I can remember, we usually get our refunds around the beginning to middle of September. Not everyone gets theirs at the same time, but you should get it before the end of September at the latest. If you have questions or concerns I suggest you contact the bursary office since hey handle most of the financial aspects of the school. 
2903	dgyywzz	dgz26ew	Rainbow6	"The basic design of Siege, where most engagements are within 10 meters, makes Glaz less viable. That being said, he wasn't completely worthless. He was still decent on some maps, such as Plane and Favela. We did see him occasionally used in pro league for certain strats, though he was pretty much a ranked only operator.

That's fine. The concept of Glaz inherently doesn't mesh well with Siege. Just make him fun for ranked, and he was good (which they did in 5.2). Instead, they tried to make him viable in pro league, and just made him this destructive monster.

"	I personally think that Glaz i balanced now. It's not like you see him in every single game, or at least not on ps4. If i'm in objective room and know they have a Glaz and start smoking the room I move to flank him even if i'm not a roamer.
2904		dkzo0iu	AskReddit		Hello-Adele. Because I can belt it out.
2905	czjbwi7	czjccst	MakingaMurderer	"Right. Bobby says he woke up around 2:30 pm, goes to the window, sees Teresa...goes hunting...comes home around 5:00 pm (around the time Scott arrived at Barb's). 




* Trial: Bobby doesn't see anything burning in the barrel at 5 pm when he got home from hunting.
* Trial: Scot doesn't see anything at 5:15 pm when he picks up Barb.
* Trial: Fabian says around 5:20 pm fire/smoke in the barrel
* Trial: Blaine says when got off the school bus at 3:45ish: "" I seen Steven Avery bringing a plastic bag to the burning barrel.""
* Trial: Gets home at 11 pm (the interview with police he was hone 9:30 pm-10 pm and saw nothing) says: ""I seen Steven Avery sitting there watching the fire.""
* Trial: Blaine is not asked if he saw a fire at 5:25-5:30 pm when he left to go trick or treating.


Summary from the trial - first police interviews do not match up:


* 3:45 pm: Blaine only person to see burn barrel/fire/smoke/Steven putting plastic bag in barrel.

* 5:00 pm-5:30 pm: only Fabian claims to have seen a fire in the barrel and that it smelled like plastic.

* 7:15 pm: Only Scott claims to have seen a fire in the pit.

* 11:00 pm: Only Blaine claims to have seen a fire in the pit.

* 3:45 pm: Blaine, Brendan, possibly Bobby were home.
* 5:15 pm: Blaine, Brendan, Barb, Bobby were home (none saw a fire or burning barrel).
* 5:20 pm: fabian and Earl were at Steve's (outside)
* 7:15  pm  Barb, Brendan, Bobby were home.
* 9:00  pm: Brendan and Bobby were home, possibly Barb.
* 10:00 pm: Brendan was home, possibly Blaine, possibly Barb.
* 11:00 pm: Brendan and Bobby were home.

If I've missed something or got a time wrong, please add.
"	Excellent summary. Thank you so much. Should I copy/paste it to the original post?
2906	czil9yb	czj8bfs	AskReddit	"I work in a comic shop and had a customer that got the name of a book wrong all the time.  The book was called ""Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose"".  TAROT, like tarot cards (TAIR-OH).  Every month he'd ask for his issue of TOKE-RAH.  I'd pronounce it the proper way, every time.... and everytime he came back he'd ask for TOKE-RAH.  

How the hell do you get a hard K sound from a word with no K (or C) in it?"	"But in the English language it is pronounced ""Tar-oh"".  
Don't get me wrong I know that many people do say it like you, but it isn't meant to be, think it's more about accents maybe?  

Source: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tarot?s=t"
2907	czit0o3	czj4gvb	AskMenOver30	"> The problem is not that you're ""not hot enough"".

The thing is, I've observed that my hotter female friends don't seem to have this sort of problem nearly as often. Guys generally are pretty straightforward in pursuing them if they think they have a chance."	"I really don't want to sound like some red pill creep, but there *is* a lot of game-playing that happens when we meet potential future romantic partners. *Maybe* your friends are hotter (but, for real, probably not), but it's likely they're just better at sending all those signals that tell a person, ""yeah, I might wanna fuck.""

It's true that some of those signals involve appearance--think clothes and makeup--so there's a relationship between successful signal-sending and attractiveness, but not really *innate* attractiveness. I have enough friends of both genders to know that beauty isn't the same thing as flirting skills, and the latter is what gets people dates. 

I'm not trying to start a fight here; I'm rooting for you! As some stranger on the internet, I know I can't change the way that you feel about your appearance. Maybe I *can* help convince you that a different approach could be more successful. 

Go get 'em! "

2909	czj8z2e	czjc1bk	LabVIEW	I think we're going to have to do overlay in real-time. We're going to need GPS data and other real time data, it might be too cumbersome to do in post processing. We'll probably just have to build a PC to spec.	"Might be worth trying to write it into a file with an index of the frame number - that way you're not doing image manipulation - just storing it - but still get all of the data. 

You could also do it in real-time on your PC - but you'll just need more resources to do so (RAM especially). 

Anywho - good luck with your venture - it is doable! "

2924	dgy1kvw	dgyuyla	AskReddit	"I got eaten out on a stage by a stripper. There were over 300 people watching. She made a lot of money that night and I drank for free and walked away with $80 in my panties. 

Edited to add some information. 

I did not contract any diseases. The strip club was called Sundowners and was on Lundy's Lane in Niagara falls Ontario. Nothing was discussed beforehand. I got on stage to tip her, which you're allowed to do and had a dollar in between my tits. She grabbed the dollar and lifted my shirt. They always went by body language to see what was ok. She went up my skirt, pulled my thong to the side and licked for a minute tops. The crowd cheered and people were throwing cash at her, I didn't take any of it because it wasn't mine. After I got off the stage I was handed drinks, drink chips and cash throughout the night. 

I may have been a bit drunk by the end of the night. If you ever get the chance to visit one of these clubs, they are awesome.

Hope I answered everyone's questions. "	I've been there and it is not the cleanest place in the world

I play weekly at a college pub and one night I went straight into club hiphop and trap at 9 PM opening because the floor was packed to the brim with everyone sloshed. Other nights when the floor is a bit empty I work up the room with some Old School hiphop and jams to work the floor up.

2954	dkzk5py	dkzxayc	AskReddit	TOOL, it will always be tool it will never not be tool. They have fans that are equal parts pretension and teen angst. Virgin rage bombs. The way they worship the band makes me uncomfortable. Every time I criticize tool the only response I get is that one guy has a big drum set and that the songs are complicated to play. This does not make the music good or the fans less annoying. The best thing about metal is that part of it does not not take itself too seriously, it balances itself in a way. Tool takes itself way to seriously it is just a horribly mundane band with a cult like following. 	I love Tool but their fanbase is pretty terrible. They haven't released anything in over 10 years and from what i've heard, their live shows really aren't what they used to be. If you don't like them, whatever but the music itself was great when they were in their prime and still holds up today

2957	dgz1e6e	dgz1mix	Blink182	"I was just referring to like the band's current ""home base"", but how would an album titled California represent a departure from their Californian roots? lol

Essentially up until the hiatus/before the reunion, blink's roots and background were always based out of San Diego. Always. But once Mark moved to L.A. it became a grey area, especially since Travis moved to L.A. not long after joining. But now enter Skiba (from Chicago) and exit Tom (the only member left who permanently resides in San Diego), that part of the band's history is definitely gone atm, regardless of the song.

For example, during the hiatus when social media was much less extensive, their MySpace page listed San Diego (I think it may have actually even said Poway) as their hometown, but now when you look at their Twitter it says Southern California, which is pretty much playing it safe. Makes reasonable sense. Either way, California is their identity as a whole."	"Look at the themes of the songs. Even though they're light and poppy, there are a bunch with a dark undertone. Even the final song, ""California"", to me is a salute to the not-so-perfect California: perfect weather, yet stay inside; empty as a movie set; etc.

Southern Cali has been part of the band since untitled. Easy Target even mentions Southern California and running from it in a round-about way."

This means that the game will show a player facing one direction (let's say North) when the player is really facing west. When this happens, some players will try to line up headshots (the game shows they aren't looking at them) and end up dying, because in reality, they're looking right at them.

What happened in this video, is Thermite was facing one way, and on his opponents screen, it showed thermite facing another direction. Because it showed him face another way, his weapon clipped through the wall, and his opponent was able to kill him through the wall. "

The traction difference between snow tires and my all-seasons is so much that snow tires actually make driving in the snow less fun (and much less dangerous) for me because they just grip, and even when breaking them loose, they don't slide nearly as easily.

Fun fact is that when Merrett debuted, he played forward for about a season, then Lethal moved him back to defence, and suddenly he was performing a lot better. It's only really after Lynch and later Bradshaw moved on or when there were injuries to fill that he started playing forward again, and IMNSHO, he's definitely weaker as a forward than a tall defender.

Also note if the player retires in the same league as you or on your team. That regen will show in either rest of the world or be a free agent.

I personally set the sensitivity of the motion control a little bit up (more sensitive), so that I don't have to move my wrists too far.

I'm imitating what I would do while sitting at my work desk, but it seems I also naturally move my elbows up and down too, so that might help you."	"nope. I've been known to my doctor that I'm medically boring for being so healthy. Yea. I could look into more videos that actually show how people are moving their wrists. 

But I also don't have a clear understanding of when the system decides the ""neutral"" start position. Like on the PS4, if you accidently have the stick pushed up on start up, the game believes that is the neutral start, so the rest of the game you're fighting against moving forward until you reset. I figure its the same here, where the start up of the motion control resets or is set at some point of the game that I'm in a less than optimal ""neutral"" position that i have to reaaally fight for control. 

I could also try upping the sensitivity and as others suggested, continue using the stick until i neeed fine tuned aiming. Which I guess isn't too much of a deal since I am playing ink heavy weapons like brushes, rollers, and MG."

I would use the Kappa crossovers since they are built for the frequency response of the speaker set. the factory curve might not line up well with the speakers. 

I would not waste money on replacing all those speakers if you are going to install a separate amp. music is recorded in 2 channel so the biggest bang will come from getting and installing a good set of component speakers in the front with that amplifier. You will not have the ability to adjust or tweak the center channel with a good DSP. and the rears are just playing what the fronts are doing which will muddy up the staging and imaging."

3029	czj6dde	czj9j1g	AskReddit	"I am really excited to answer this!!!

1. Hillary has been an advocate for women and children her entire life. After graduating at the top of her class, she went to work for the [Children's Defense Fund](http://www.childrensdefense.org/newsroom/cdf-in-the-news/press-releases/2013/honoring-hillary-clinton.html).
She also found a home-based education system in Israel, and made it happen in Arkansas. 26 states now use this program. [More] (http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/24/hillary-clinton-cites-israel-as-inspiration-for-home-based-education-programs/#)
She has very similar views as Bernie when it comes to Women's healthcare and occupational rights. But wouldn't you want someone making decisions about Women's health coming from an actual woman? [More about Hillary on Women's rights](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/womens-rights-and-opportunity/). 

2. I don't have a source to back this up, so I am open to rebuttal, but having a president as far left as Bernie will result in inevitable gridlock in congress. A Republican congressperson may be more open to one of Hillary's proposals rather than Bernie's. His supporters are driven by the thought of a political revolution, but you cannot revolutionize the political system through executive action. Hillary has a background of working with members of the opposite party to accomplish her goals. [Like the time when she was First-Lady, and she worked with Republican members of congress to create the Children's Health Insurance program, which is still in place today i think?](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/)

3. She was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign. A lot of people got really mad about that, but as a gay man, I see that as a big deal.

4. She is the only candidate that has really addressed the epidemic in our country that is Alzheimer's Disease. She has released a [plan](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/alzheimers-disease/) on her website about taking steps to finding a cure. *This reminds me of Obama's SOTU 2016 when he suggested that 2016 could be the year we curse cancer, and put Joe Biden in charge*

5. She is very similar to Obama. Those on the Republican side believe that a vote for Clinton is a vote for another 4 years of Obama. I believe that sounds great? Obama has his flaws but he is awesome? 

6. Yeah she fucked up with the emails. I can admit that. She fucked up pretty bad. But there is no way anything like that will happen again, *amirite?* she's probably learned her lesson.

7. I am actually an intern on her campaign, so i have had first-hand experience talking to her supporters. The people that I talk to are genuinely nice people. They acknowledge her faults, but chose to support her based on her best qualities like the ones I have listed above. They don't bash Bernie, but honestly believe that Hillary's policies are more realistic. When I look at Bernie's fan base, they tend to focus on Hillary's faults and embrace his strengths. But it has gotten out of hand. Young people are saying that Hillary could be worse than any republican (she's not.) Don't even get me started on the Sanders' circle jerk that is /r/politics. 


I am going to wrap this up now, because I am getting really tired of typing. But if you took anything out of this huge amount of text it would be this:

TL;DR Bernie is great and it's awesome that you support him, but my vision for America is different than yours, so I support Hillary. Can we please stop being dicks to her?"	Haha it's hilarious, and actually pretty sad, that you already assumed that I am a Bernie supporter. I hate that /r/politics is a total Bernie ass kissing festival, I really want to hear other's opinions so I can actually think about why I justify my own and possibly so I can change my views and be better informed. And I totally agree with you and I am well aware that political revolution cannot come from executive action and sadly it seems that most Americans (especially select republicans who blame everything on Obama while we have a Republican dominated congress) believe that the president is basically a king. But I do have to disagree with you about Bernie supporters trashing Hillary and focusing totally on Bernie's strengths. Although it may be true with some (college age liberal redditors [my closed minded peers whom I attempt to distance myself from]) most people in my friend group and family who are Bernie supporters do not believe that Hillary is as bad as any republican. I promise you I prefer her above any of them as much as I believe her mistakes are rather serious. Some of the anger at Hillary that Bernie supporters may possess could  be evident because the Sanders campaign itself is not directly attacking Hillary, resulting in the Sanders supporters simply wanting their opinion of Hillary to be heard.  Anyway thank you for your response, hopefully some day that reddit can become less of a Sanders echo chamber and that people can have reasonable discussions.

What a weird reaction. I guess I didn't explain myself well. I am denying any connection between religious belief and schizophrenia or chemical imbalances. Brain defects always lead to dysfunctional life skills and religion (even wrong religions) generally does not. 

>You still haven't told me though, how do you respond to other people, who have also experienced extraordinary events, whose experiences may contradict yours or someone else's similar experience (as an example, Muhammad claimed to have been visited by an angel, leading him to found Islam).  

I'm not worried or argumentative about it. I know life is hard and though some people pretend that finding out the truth is a simple matter I let people work it out on their own. Atheism more than most ideologies depends on disproving others and while defending the our position is a part of Christianity it is much more the case with atheism. "	"&gt;What a weird reaction. I guess I didn't explain myself well. I am denying any connection between religious belief and schizophrenia or chemical imbalances. Brain defects always lead to dysfunctional life skills and religion (even wrong religions) generally does not.

Oh, I think we were both reading past each other then.  

I meant to try and demonstrate why the senses and emotions of one person aren't as credible a source as testable hypothesis, and tangible information etc.  

Specifically, I was trying to back up my claim that not all forms of evidence are equal.  Maybe I'm not arguing correctly against your original statement though so...

What are examples of different forms of evidence that science does not look at when considering theories or testing hypothesis?  "

Of course the plant hero would have to be at full health to see if all three attacks occur. This could also be done with a line dancer but the second plant should then have more than 8 health.	yes, it would need to be in a friendly set up as for this combo to do 21-24 damages in 1 lane, everything would need to be just right including your opponent's health and block meter :D

3073		czjetfo	Drugs		"Alcohol and marijuana are completely different for me. 

When I'm high, everything becomes trippy and I am more out of it. It's harder for me to complete tasks (ex. using a microwave, cooking etc). It feels like my motor skills/speed has decreased, but I usually am able to catch/throw things as good as I can sober. Even though I am more out of it, I am told I become chill as fuck and I can keep my cool (even though it doesn't feel that way lmao). There is also a burnout period with weed, making you have an overwhelming need to sleep. Driving home is not impossible but HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. This is good for chill outs with your friends, solo-sessions, self reflection, listening to music and movie watching (no complex movies because I usually lose interest quick). Weed hangovers are a thing, but they don't physically hurt. My head is a bit light headed, and usually I get moderately depressed. Can last up to 2 days depending on how much you had.

When I'm drunk, my surroundings get desensitized to my brain, if that makes any sense. My motor skills/speed/spacial awareness feel the same, but in reality they're in the shitter. I become very flirty when drunk. I say the truth a lot (sometimes too much), and if I get too drunk I become very loud and make an ass out of myself. Alcohol (depending on the person) has a period cal the ""dizzies"" where you feel like [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/a/ae/Hyperspace_falcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20130312014242) is happening to you. Driving home is impossible when smashed, seriously get a cab. This is good for bars, social events, and meeting new people (all in moderate amounts, because drinking too much is not good in any situation). Alcohol hangovers are a thing obviously, causing heavy headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, lightheadedness and regret.

When mixing the two, both the desensitization and trippy combine, fucking me up. It's almost impossible for me to do anything (ex. last time I mixed I watched myself spill a whole box of cereal on the ground and was too fucked to clean it up). I'm still flirty, but not loud. Do not drive home when doing this, you will not have a good time. My body (specifically my face and fingertips) get really fuzzy, almost a pins and needles feeling, but it feels really good. I recommend more weed than alcohol when mixing, cause imo it feels better and it reduces hangover the next day. The hangover is a combination of the two others, so it's not pleasant. Mixing is good for house parties, clubs and concerts.

**td;lr - They're very different, combined they mix some qualities. Everyone is different, so this might not match exactly what you'd feel, but it'd be similar.**"

3076	czj4oek	czj5jn0	Accounting	"Various things that you may or may not have appreciated in  relation to this:

-working capital represents only the operating assets and liabilities of a business, it should exclude anything that is debt or debt like to show only the working capitalism position that is due to operating (not investing or financing) decisions.

-working capital EXCLUDES cash, which may seem odd. One way to understand working capital is that it is the opposite of cash from operating activities. When your working capital decreases, your cash goes up, when your working capital increases, your cash goes down

-because of this relationship, working capital represents the amount of cash trapped in the business that cannot be used to pay dividends, pay debt or invest in assets.

-the problem with just looking at the cash balance is that it is harder to work out areas of improvement, harder to compare trends to previous periods and also harder to work out whether your cash is being impacted by cash from operations, or cash from financing or investing. (Unless of course you use a cashflow statement, which requires calculation of working capital anyway!)"	"Also, you are right that low working capital is better, but of course companies need some level of WC to operate. (Eg if you are a retailer you could reduce your WC by selling down all your stock, but what happens after that!)

Therefore what you are really concerned with is looking at trends in working capital and understanding whether there are ways to decrease working capital without affecting other things. If you decrease working capital by $5m, this is $5m of cash available immediately to the company, sometimes working capital management is the difference between success and bankruptcy.

-looking at days of sales or purchases in working capital balances helps understand the operating cycle of a business, again something you can't do with cash. Eg if a company has 10 days of sales in debtors, this means it takes 10 days to convert sales into cash. If creditors are payable in 5 days, this means you have to pay your expenses quicker than you collect cash. Overall this means you have 5 days of working capital that the company has to finance somehow. Looking at days sales or purchases rather than absolute values lets you compare trends even if the company has grown or declined significantly. Again, you can't see this looking at the cash balance."

3098	dkzhvu8	dkzpdce	FindingFennsGold	"My point was that just because the search area has been narrowed by additional clues (I think that) most of us recognize the fact that the chances of finding the thing are still very very small. 

Many of us (including me) have come to realize after wasting some time and money, that we have to be MUCH more certain about a particular solve before we venture out again and spend time and money. We run our solves by others (family or friends), we try to eliminate ""confirmation bias"", we try to poke holes in our theories in every way possible. 

I've personally been back and forth between a place in Wyoming and another in New Mexico due to what I see are conflicts in two possible solutions. Both are pretty good, but I refuse to go until I feel that I can ""move with confidence"". If I still don't find it, then I'll chalk it up to another adventure and go back to the drawing board. 

On a personal note, I wasn't trying to disparage you - just wanted to say that it's not worth doing this if it's not fun. At least it wouldn't be for me."	"See, if I was one of those people who searched in Utah or Idaho, I would be pissed off....and that also goes for the Rio Grande Gorge and the hint that it is not under water as well.  Many people have spent millions of dollars looking in those states, areas, and places...and it's not fair to take them away after they have been searched by many.  Those two men who died in NM in my opinion died in vain, because he removed the area from the ""official map"" after the fact.  He should have just left everything as is and said, let the chips fall where they may.  I for one do not have anymore faith in Forrest Fenn because he removed the Gorge off of the official map.  If I were you, cjonesmo, I would save your money and forget about the treasure hunt, because at this point it's not about whether you have the correct solve or not, it's about whether Fenn is going to cut more areas away from his map.  I look at that map as a contract, not to be altered in anyway.....and Fenn to me is not abiding by the spirit of that contract with us searchers.  So in my opinion, I've been mislead up till now, and what changes may come to his map tomorrow, who knows?"

3114	dkz9bfv	dkzv4ur	AskReddit	I was house sitting in a huge house and set up a canary camera near my bedroom. I had an uneasy feeling someone else was in the house with me so I set up the camera just to make sure no one came near my room. In the middle of the night someone approached it from behind and turned it so it faced a blank wall. Then a few minutes later turned it back the way it was before. It tripped the canary and I got a notification on my phone. I saw it and searched the house thoroughly the next morning and never found anything. Needless to say, I slept with my door locked the rest of my time there. 	"Ugh this reminds me of the last and final time I house sat. I was watching my parents friends cat and since they had a pool and Wi-Fi (my parents didn't at the time) they let me stay at their house. It was very old, a very closed-off floor plan with tons of random doors and windows and a lot of hidden nooks. I never felt comfortable when I was there, but I just chalked it up to the house being old and creaky. 

One wednesday, after am unexpected half day, I get back to their house from work to feed the cat. Before doing anything else, I went to the bathroom. Even though I was there alone (or so I thought) I latched the hook lock. Im sitting there on the toilet and I watch the door get pushed gently to the extent that the hook would let it go, like someone was trying to very quietly see if they could get in. I told myself I was being stupid and that no one could be in there, I had locked all the doors every day. At the end of watching their house, I'm changing the bird feeder for the first time since I had been there and I noticed a door on the back porch that had been unlocked the whole time I was there. Every night I had slept there by myself, every time I heard noises and thought I was being stupid. The fucking house was wide open. "

3129		czjgnrz	CruciblePlaybook		It def takes getting used to, but yea once I started going for all head shots (as dumb as that sounds) I did very well with it today.  Surprisingly beat out a lot of snipers today as long as that first shot I land is a head shot, I assume it causes a lot of flinch
3130	dgyv2yn	dgyv3jc	AskOuija	I	[removed]
3131	dkzi71p	dkzqkkw	AskReddit	But it's not like these rankings are based on which universities appears in more movies.  	"But a lot of those rankings are heavily based on branding and favor the anglosphere.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings

for instance"
3132		czj9ohn	PurplePillDebate		Isn't it true that in the US women have always overwhelmingly voted democrat? This seems to much of a coincidence to just be swept under the rug, so I am inclined to agree that hormones do affect political views. Is this really that groundbreaking however? everything from your mood to the growth of body hair to the amount of muscle on your body is based upon the hormones in your body right now, this is relatively small in comparison.

3134		czj56uc	NASCAR		"RCR will come back strong. Dillon and Newman will be contenders.

Ganassi will come back even stronger. Both drivers make the Chase, and Larson gets multiple wins.

Roush does better, but they still aren't front runners consistently.

HScott gets some top 10's with Bowyer. Not much else other than that.

BK Racing is about as good as MWR was last year. Not good, but not horrible.

LFR gets some good finishes with Ty Dillon.

Front Row Motorsports possibly wins a race. A plate race, more than likely. Buescher and Cassill are very good plate racers."
3135	dgytoiu	dgyvkfr	Blackfellas	"A white lurker to me isn't an infiltrator. We may be pretty vocal and often very harsh in our feelings  of the white collective, but I think we are welcoming. 

What I meant was I wonder how many of the type of trolls referenced in this article are on this sub. There used to be a guy, GOPBlackGuy or something similar. He regularly posted how we should be good Christians, and bordered on how we should bow before whites. I feel like that guy was an infiltrator "	This sub and /r/blackladies are two of the most welcoming subs on the entire site.

3139		dkzwgmm	CasualConversation		Was playing a bit of Destiny after some Doom, I have to say, going from 100+ FPS to 30 takes a lot of getting used to.  Started listening to a Fallout 4 video essay and now I'm listening to music (The Forest Seasons by Wintersun, which is less exciting than I think everyone was hoping), all while drinking a Mortal Kombat beer.

3146	dkz5ykr	dkzu3xx	DarkAndLight	"I don't think Cohhcarnage needs to ""suck it up"", he's one of the biggest streamers on Twitch. Combat is a pretty fundamental thing for an RPG, something that certainly should have been working before opening the game up to EA."	"Theres a difference between ""working fine for our QA team of 30-100"" and ""working fine for 10 000 people crowding onto the servers at once"". That difference is EXACTLY what EA is for."

3159	dgyzb8a	dgz0vm9	SquaredCircle	"That PPV had no business being that good!

Swerves left, right and centre and not just stupid unpredictability, it was good unpredictability. Everyone was booked fairly strong, Shaesaro lost because of inexperience, Bayley lost because of a shoulder into the lower post (which sounded absolutely brutal), Randy lost because of Singh Bros and Jinder and Bray got his win and Jinder looks legit, and Roman actually lost for once. 

I had very little expectations for this PPV but damn, they really delivered on it. 

**I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU!!**"	It was a great PPV in my opinion. Helps that almost everyone I wanted to win, did.

I remember  walking down the steps and telling my dad I was gonna drive over to a friend's house. As I was turning for the door, he told me wait and he then punched me dead in the chest. He told not to fuck 
anything up and have a fun time. My mom was the same way. We would play fight and shadow box all the time. She bloodied my nose with a left hook one day...good times."
3161	dgytecv	dgythbs	LetItDie	You just need to hit them with a fish.  Brain shrooms don't work.  	Well you saved me a death. I'll probably try it tomorrow. I'm all burnt out. I did ten floors and a ton of grinding in two days.

3165	czj2oev	czj6ltd	Paranormal	Imaginary friends are not unusual in young children, they even often give them a reduplicated name like that. It isn't a  paranormal thing. 	But occasionally the imaginary friend isn't imaginary.

Whenever you go to such appointments, do not disclose you are going to ADAPT to anyone in your chain but just a general doctor's appointment or something along those lines.

3170	dgyx5ej	dgyxkmh	Portland	"> I don't talk to many people in this town. I tried playing nice at first, but when I realized how fake and pretentious everyone around here is, I didn't waste my time anymore.

""People quickly learned how awful I was and stopped inviting me out, I decided that I don't need friends anymore and that's my decision not anyone else's...MY DECISION.""

>People who interact with me generally appreciate my honesty and the fact that I don't feel the need to impress people.

""I found a few other fringe characters that meet my boring blue collar expectations. I ***CHOSE*** to keep these ones around because they meet my narrow minded view of the world."""	"Well yeah, it was my decision to give up on meeting anyone here. I didn't say otherwise. I have a low tolerance for fake people, so after some time, I stopped making the effort. Never let anyone close enough to me to find out if I was awful or not. It only takes one conversation to see how badly a person is TRYING to impress you, and I'm not of the type to TRY to impress anyone. That's pathetic.

I would say that people CHOSE to keep me around. I fucked up all my relationships with everybody during my 10 plus year drinking career. I gave everyone the chance to break it off cleanly, and I wouldn't have blamed them. If someone thought I had fucked up enough to the degree that they didn't want to associate with me, I never begged them, nor do I hold it against them. Most of my friends who have seen the best and worst of me. Guess they thought the best outweighed 10 plus years of being a shitty person though, because they CHOSE to remain friends."

3178		czjesu2	LifeProTips		The problem that you face is that you've built up a tolerance to the consequences. Making the same bad decisions repeatedly means you have a callous to the negative effects that come after. What you have to do now is learn to appreciate the positive that comes from NOT making those mistakes.
3179		dgys8cx	Fitness		"No. Why would I watch an old man giving his opinion on other guys in thongs posing?

3180		czj5p4r	AskReddit		I live in the southern U.S., and I hear a lot of mispronunciations:  Pillow=piller, corner=co-ner, and back there=back air. There are a lot more, but I can't think of them all right now.
3181		dgyve3p	QuotesPorn		I like the quote, but Lincoln didn't live by that principle. He suspended habeas corpus and ordered the slaughter of innocents. 
3182	dgyyfoi	dgyyh29	SquaredCircle	Who's saying that? I'm just seeing people say this is Alexas best match yet 	A lot of people are saying this is Bayley's best match
3183		dgyy7ac	TrueAtheism		I recommend reading philosophical books. I used to be a Christian but lost my faith and converted to atheism. I understand what you are saying. I am currently a philosophy major and existential philosophy can really help. Try reading Kierkegaard, Camus, Satre, and most importantly Nietzsche. They are all atheist except Kierkegaard but even he gives good advice about how to deal with anxiety when we realize the shit-storm of a world we live in. These philosophers try and teach what do in the face of the nihilistic meaningless world we live in, which when realized can really dampen ones mood. Hope this helps and good luck. Cheers
3184	czj6p3x	czj8r4x	Documentaries	[verwijderd]	You're missing the point and being needlessly defensive.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to have your own first-hand experience of something instead of relying strictly on what your government and movie industry tell you.

3198	dgy4yyv	dgz1kns	Advice	[verwijderd]	Really bad. Investments in apps fall out. Everyone stops buying apps basically. Think dotcom vrash but worldwide and 10 times worse. Short term there is just gonna be a shittonne of ads to make their money back. Lots of ugly brand deals. Apps disappearing from the appstore if they had no money. Apple removing things that don't make them money.

3207	dgyr7nv	dgyz1eo	PublicFreakout	There doesn't need to be a specific law addressing this, though I believe there is in many states. It's covered under general self defense provided you perceived imminent harm. 	Okay, sure.  But for everyone else reading this, realize that self-defense is an affirmative defense, so you are presumed to be guilty and the burden of proof is on you to show that you were in imminent danger.
3208	dgyrje3	dgyumvy	HateCrimeHoaxes	">White means European ancestry. You know that, but you're just being cute. 

What is ""European""? Europe as a concept comes from the very limited worldview of ancient greeks. And even they didn't put weight into it in terms of an identity, as they certainly didn't feel more connected with other ""Europeans"" than they did the Indo-Iranians to the east.

>Races do exist, any ""scholar"" that tries to prove otherwise is just really trying to redefine scientifically proven genetic clusters as ""socially constructed."" (As liberals who can't find jobs outside of academia tend to do.)

The way you phrase this shows that you have no understanding of what they're even saying. Those who say race is a social construct don't deny the fact that there are genetic clusters of people.

>I'm sure there's a name for the logical fallacy of cherry-picking examples to disprove the rule, but I don't know what it is.

How am I cherry picking? Most of the ""nations"" of earth have formed in the last 300 years as a result of colonialism. Either one people had conquered another, resulting in boarders being based on politics as recent as that, or one people had been overlords of another and then drew borders with little regard for those who live there. This is true for almost all countries in the Americas, the Pacific, or Africa, while also being true for quite a few of those in the Middle East, South Asia or Southeast Asia."	"I think we both agree on historical facts, we just differ on interpretation.  There is no denying European people have a specific genetic signature.  ""Identifying"" with something is obviously subjective, and would logically be different for Europeans on the Med than say, the ones who built stone henge."

3210	dgz00uc	dgz0wnb	AFL	[verwijderd]	"**Stats:**

R1: Sloane 24D 9CL 13CP 4T 0G vs GWS

Danger 24D 5CL 15CP 9T 3G vs Freo

R2: Sloane 25D 8CL 15CP 15T 1G vs Hawks

Danger 37D 11CL 25CP 6T 1G vs North

R3: Sloane 31D 8CL 24CP 9T 1G vs Port

Danger 36D 9Cl 20CP 2T 3G vs Melbourne

Total:

Sloane 80D, 25CL, 52CP, 28T, 2G

Danger 97D, 25CL, 60CP, 17T, 7G

**Discussion:**

Dangerfield is on top for all listed stats other than equal in Clearances after 3 rounds. An arguement can however be made for the quality of opponents. Adelaide faced and beat fellow top 5 opponents in GWS and Port Adelaide, as well as the lowly Hawks. Geelong faced Freo (11th after 6 rounds), North (15th after 6 rounds), and Melbourne (8th after 6 rounds). Note that Geelong only narrowly won vs North.

Dangerfield has the stats, but has accumulated these stats in a team lacking midfield strength and facing lowly opponents. 

Sloane is only slightly behind in stats, and would be considered Elite for all, and has versed much tougher opponents. 

**Verdict:**

Both are good stop fighting.

I'd strongly recommend leveling your 5* Renji only to get a multi-colored PVP team atleast until you pull another 5* or 4* worthy PVP unit. I'd recommend saving all orbs you get for future events (judging off the new theme we should have an event coming up for valentines day)."

In terms of writing, my biggest criticism is pacing. It's always been my contention that she should've been introduced as an NPC much earlier in the game so that we could get little snapshots of her personality or her opinions on current events.

Conversely, my biggest criticism of Makoto is that she gets a lot of the spotlight compared to other Thief characters.

3371	czjfopj	czjgdrm	CCW	"It's an interesting question because one seemingly possible outcome wouldn't be good for us carriers: petty crimes could get a lot more deadly.

Imagine there was a 50/50 chance someone you were going to, let's say mug, had a gun.  That'd be a significant increase from what it is today, but let's go with it.  Given that scenario, a perpetrator really has two choices:  (a) play the odds and go in unarmed, or (b) attack violently and swiftly to ensure their own safety, at the very possibly mortal expense of yours.

Now, the obvious retort is that someone that's just interested in your wallet may not be a violent criminal much of the time and will take option (c), which is to be dissuaded from the crime entirely.  Obviously, that's the possibility we who advocate carrying would say is the most likely, and certainly the most desirable.  I mean, it's certainly true that someone intend on mugging you isn't necessarily willing to go the next step of murdering you for the possibility of a few dollars.

But, some certainly may be.  And, if the economy took a nosedive and people were very desperate for example, an otherwise not life-threatening mugging might become a life-or-death thing because the mugger may decide it's better for them to shoot you in the back of the head and take your wallet then risk getting shot themselves.  If they're really that desperate for the money then the idea of killing someone for it may not seem as far-fetched as it once did, and if that's true then simply killing you before you have a chance to respond is in their best interests (to their warped mind I mean)."	That's when I take my family into the hills and take our chances with the animals.

And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of *any* objections. People don't act like that for no reason.

It's honestly more sad than anything else.  How people can be so mis-informed is just beyond me.  I personally blame The Guardian and the sad lack of economics education in school.

I don't understand how someone can say something so flat-out wrong as:

&gt;f it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

And be taken seriously.  It's just amazing how little interest in reality this place has.

&gt;If it operated for even ten years the environmental damage it does would destroy far more jobs in tourism than it would create.

This is just wrong.  A flat out lie.  There is no evidence to suggest this and I don't know why you'd bother writing it out.

&gt;And it won't operate for ten years - solar is cheaper.

Solar and coal don't compete as solar is intermittent and requires large amounts of redundancy.  When solar is capable of running at all times we might be having a different conversation.

&gt;This is the economic reality.

No, it is not.  This is a lie to fit your priors.

&gt;Your whole act on this subreddit is pretending that you are the ""smart guy"" who ""faces the realities of economics"" (which by some bizarre coincidence always lines up with the Murdoch/Coalition party line) - so how can you justify promoting coal?

Because India lives in horrific poverty and coal allows them to rise out of it.  The 100% renewable study commissioned required India to be 1/7th as wealthy as us.  I'm not comfortable with consigning a sixth of the planet to abject poverty because they had the misfortune to develop after us.

Also yes, I do promote economic reality.  It should say something that I then line up with the LNP a whole heap more than the ALP.  Something about the ALP being a bunch of incompetent buffoons lying to the Australian people.

&gt;If we give a billion dollars to these scam artists we will never get it back.

Ok.  I'm not going to pay back my home loan.  That's how these things work lmao.

&gt; That's why the banks are refusing to back it.

They're refusing to back it because the federal ALP are refusing to back it.  This is known as sovereign risk.

&gt;Their economic modelling, no doubt dismissed by the likes of you as ""lefty nonsense"", shows that the mine will be a failure.

Then it will be a failure.  That's fine.  The infrastructure will not solely be used by Adani.

&gt;And yet we have these politicians at State and Federal level who are acting with desperate commitment to making it happen regardless of any objections.

Reasonable objections have been met.  This is probably the most stringently regulated mine in the history of the world.

Every other objection requires it to be blocked through legislative fiat, which the party of free markets will not do.

Now people on discord think I'm foolish trying to help you since they keep saying you aren't open to change, so I'm offering to give you quirk ideas, hell I'll even come up with some quirks for you depending on what type of quirk you want and I'll help you with your stats as well plus with anything else you need. Please let me help you man.....becuase I'll tell you again if you go ahead and use ""Flower Spam"" again I won't be able to help you and I can give guarantee that you won't make in any tournament as long as you stitck to that op quirk "	"Nah is alright man thanks, i think is better to give up on this one if internet teach me something is that once you fuck it up there is no coming back people don't forget anything, thanks for ofering your help it's really apreciated but I think is better that I get down, if i'm not mistaken the Boku no hero fandom is not presisely known for being understanding (no meme rule, seriously?) 

You are an exception throught we need more people like you

I hate communities that do this kind of things, i can repair the quirk and even add or quit some things but you say is no use, that ""flower spam"" already has an stigma so it's going to be rejected even if it's good to go just because people hated the original... ok im done i'm not here for this shits thanks again man (or woman idk) but i'm done

Don't worry about ideas, i have several, i'm going to tell you something ""flower spam"" was the sixth on the list of possible quirks for this, i choose it because it was funny and really diferent to anything i see before, unique you can say, in a begining it was just that, spam flowers, useless right? but then i start thinking

¿Can flowers grow in any surface, or just in soil?

¿Can flowers grow in living beings? 

¿Another creation quirks use something to create things, they didn't appear from thin air, what does the flowers use? 

I like the idea, I began to plan things, start writing concepts, organizing my ideas, etc, four days later i was good to go and even then is incomplete

the other quirks i have planned we're rejected because 

a) they were to similar to other quirks, both from this page and from the series

b) they we're stupidly op

And since i write this another ideas came to my mind

Just three of the ideas i think off

Muscle presure: this quirk allows the user to put strain in their muscle compresing them allowing to use the 100% of the human muscle power or even increase it beyond the human limit, more than 100% 

Rejected because it was to similar to one for all, it's weakness even where that the strain the body goes after using the quirk break the users body

Golden form: the user can transform for several seconds into a special form that heavily increase the strength, agility, endurance, etc, and gives the power to fly, after it's use the user collapse from tireness

It is based on the súper saiyan yes, but I don't think it was that usefull, i wanted to create a quirk that can be use effectively in tandem alongside the users own capabilities, this was more like a ""last resort"" attack so no

Magnetization: the user can magnetize his body to atract metalic objects from his sourroundings to use them as weapon, armour etc, he needs to be carefull or otherwise the objective can travel to fast an knock him down with a powerfull blow

To boring

Anyway hope i see you around, again thanks for anything"

This is my local shop but it is not OPs. The judge is co-owner and son of the shop owner. The shop owner has been difficult over the last few months and was frustrated that so few people came to the GPT. The only people that came were locals (plus OP who was local but has recently moved away) so the event was smaller than he expected. I believe that that favoritism played the biggest role in this. I can't imagine anyone else in the event would have this rule applied to them except OP wasn't local. 

The honest truth from my perspective, is I dodged the hardest match-up in the quarter-finals because of this, and was able to role to the finals easier because of this.

Just to make life more fun, a tip for cloakies, if there is a dictor anywhere near you, do not try to warp, if you do, and he bubbles, you'll stop. Instead, double click in a random direction, cloak, mwd, then change direction by 90 degrees, but not too sharply or you'll stall."	"A small detail to add - there *is* such thing as ""too much speed"" when you're trying to decloak smaller ships, and I'd recommend not overloading your MWD when trying to decloak.

First, a few basics; then, an illustrated explanation:

 * Use the Centered Tracking camera setting to always get a reliable angle on their position when they decloak.

 * Always double-click in space instead of clicking the decloaked target and approaching, because once an object ""no longer exists"" in Eve (destroyed, cloaked, warped off-grid, etc.) your vector of movement gets messed up in most cases.

OK, so:

**1.** [Here you are in your Sabre](http://i.imgur.com/IGaCz0I.jpg), which has its own collision model. The covops also has its own collision model. Your goal is to get within 2000m (global decloak radius) from the *edge* of the pinata's collision model.

**2.** [You start burning at the guy (let's assume meh skills and a nano)](http://i.imgur.com/Btiso70.jpg). The covops will only decloak if *during a given tick* your collision model intersects with their model+decloak radius. In the case of this Sabre, there are two ticks during which you'll get a decloak, so that's good.

**3.** You might be tempted to overload your MWD so you can ohmygodgettohimbeforehegetsoutofmybubble. Thing is, [when you overload your MWD you are basically spreading apart your collision-per-tick spheres farther](http://i.imgur.com/feMKByN.jpg). In this example it doesn't look so bad, because you had a really good vector in the first place. 

**4.** But yeah, don't do that. Why? Well, say that your trajectory is a little bit off. [In fact, here's the closest possible edge case](http://i.imgur.com/jnRRFwa.jpg). Basically you can see that you are actually passing too quickly through the sphere formed by the covops's modelRadius+2000m. For comparison, [here's the exact same vector without your prop overloaded](http://i.imgur.com/0vO9PBL.jpg). The more you increase speed beyond a reasonable number, the more you start counterproductively decreasing your allowable margin of error for your approach vector. Going too fast might even mean drifting out of heated scram range despite getting a successful decloak.

**5.** It seems like a really pedantic point to make when you consider the range of speed of Interdictors, I'll admit. If you need some training wheels for a bit, just drop a second bubble along the way. But keep in mind that it becomes *really* important when you're in something like a fleet ceptor, though, since those are so fast and their model sizes are too small.

----

**Summary:** You want the ""right"" speed for decloaking, not the ""highest speed"": decloaking is tick-based and &gt;3km/s~ you might actually start fucking yourself over. Fleet interceptors may want to attempt to decloak at below max speed.

Rank 105, team cost 120

Current Team:Divine Warden U&Y, Duke Vampire Lord, Princess Valkyrie, Enchantress of the Sea, Siren, Lilith

Non IAP

Stopped playing for a while, only checking in to collect stones and occasionally roll. Wondering if there's a better team I can put together/target with what I have now. 
"	"Yes.  Yes there is.  There are, in fact, several better teams you can put together.  Your 120 cost is still going to slow things down until you rank up, but we'll work with what we can.  

1.  Devil team.  You have 2 red sonias, therefore you have a devil team.  Sonia / Sonia / Vampire / [King Baddie](http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=688) / Zuoh / Lilith or Lucifer // friend Beelzebub is a great devil team.  Now, it's way too expensive, so you'd need to rank up a lot.  Tone it down a bit and use Sonia / Vampire / King Baddie /  Big Baddie / Lilith // friend Beelzebub for a 103 cost version that'll get you started.  

2.  Urd is a great fire team leader.  Urd / Cao Cao / Ares / Yamato Takeru / Chiyome is a solid fire TPA team.  100 cost in the current forms you have, so you can run that, too.  Evolve your monsters as your cost increases and you can afford to - Urd first.  

3.  Bastet.  You have a great Bastet setup: Bastet / Vishnu / Meimei / 2 from [Susano (for shield) / Freyja (damage boost) / Meimei2 (more boards) / Vishnu2 (more TPAs).  Pair with Verdandi or Awoken Bastet.  This is actually an endgame-potential team, once you level up, evolve, and awaken everything.  The current iteration is right around 100 cost, depending on which flex subs you take, so it's also affordable.  

4.  Freyja.  She's got a new buddy in Sylvie, so if you can find a Sylvie friend and run them together, she's very powerful.  I'd go Freyja / Michael / Meimei / Bastet / Vishnu // Sylvie friend.  Also affordable for you.  

5.  If you can evolve your DMeta, you can run DMeta / Satsuki / Persephone / Lucifer / dark flex (whatever you can afford, this will be hard given ult DMeta is 70 by herself).  Ultimate Dark Metatron is extremely powerful, so this would be a ""something to work towards"" team.  

Try out those teams, get a feel for them, and see what you end up enjoying most.  It's good to work on a few teams, since sometimes one breezes through where another gets stopped, but you really have a lot to work with.  "

Rumble clearly isn't fully motivated in MMA anymore. Rumble just wants Dana to offer him $500k to get in the Octagon with Jon, throw a flurry, get taken down and then submitted.

"Oil cleansing is exactly what it sounds like-/ instead of a traditional face wash, you use some kind of oil to cleanse your face. [the wiki has lots of useful info on OCM](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) although I have a small disagreement with the How To: you should apply oil to your *dry* face, not wet. Massage the oil gently into your skin, then rinse away. If you are using straight oils you may need to use a damp washcloth to get rid of residue. If you're using a commercial oil cleansing product it probably has emulsifiers in it so the reside will rinse away. 

I myself has used various different oils-- from straight up mineral oil or olive oil to store night oil cleansers. I am currently obsessed with [this Palmer's](http://www.target.com/p/palmers-skin-therapy-cleansing-oil-face-6-5-oz/-/A-49111078?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;amp;CPNG=PLA_Health+Beauty+Shopping&amp;amp;adgroup=SC_Health+Beauty&amp;amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;device=m&amp;amp;location=9003386&amp;amp;gclid=CNf3utXCzdMCFQSHswod2SAI4Q&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) cleanser and have been using it for the last year or so.

Back in the 90s I was an associate working at our local department store, in Housewares, Toys and Sports. Russ Trolls were all the rage for some reason, and we had both TV and print ads selling these ugly things for $14.99. We also had a cheaper and larger version by another company for $12.99.

This male customer got into an argument with the department manager because he SWORE the Russ Trolls were $12.99, and he DEMANDED he be sold one at $12.99. Soon into the argument his wife stormed over to the manager and claimed she saw the TV ad showing the Russ Trolls at $12.99 (nope, we had a copy of the ads in the office).

They got so loud and obnoxious that soon there were what had to have been nearly 20 adults, ALL yelling and demanding the Russ Trolls for $12.99. They actually ran down the doll aisle to grab them before we had the head of security finally restore some semblance of order and told the crowd that he would take their names and phone numbers and give them a call once everything was ""sorted out"".

> however the emergence of a slew late night comedians delving full on into the world of politics with blatant political agendas of their own (Colbert, Samantha Bee, Olvier himself) and hide behind a facade of entertainment is far more insidious.

which is an insane finish after a few rather moot points."	How exactly is this an insane finish? When the sum total of the numbers of viewers and followers of Last Week Tonight alone more than double those of InfoWars, it would seem apparent that Oliver would have just as much sway in the realm of politics as Jones in terms of the average American. It is one thing to shine the light on a news organization founded on conspiracy and outright falsehoods. But he acts as though this fringe element is more dangerous to the general populace despite the fact that Jones clearly presents himself as the head of a media element with a very open agenda. Oliver presents his show as having researched findings (dozens of which distort the truth or fail to tackle an issue from more than one perspective) while peppering these segments with personal attacks and fabrications of his own. This tactic, which can be seen coming from Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, and the like, leads to days of media coverage from official news organizations who extol these programs as though they contain an ounce of journalistic integrity. These same comedians will then boast and proudly declare themselves a line of defense against fake news when they seek to bolster a particular world view, regardless of facts. However, when such criticisms are directed their way, comedians like Oliver will simply claim to be pure entertainers, knowing full well the effects of their shows on the political sphere. The same arguments would hold even if his attacks were directed at CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.

1) Try using a larger/longer wiper blade on the upper wiper arm, so that it wipes the area directly in front of the camera lens.  Depending on how the windshield molding is shaped, you might excessively bend the upper inch or two of wiper blade, so you'll hae to replace it more frequently.

2) Move your camera lens over to the right a couple of inches.  Depending on the specific design/setup of your dash-cam, you might be able to do this by flipping the camera around (left-end on right, right-end on left), or shift the camera as installed a couple of inches.  You should be able to get some additional double-side adhesive install pads from the camera manufacturer website, or from Amazon.

OTOH, we know the church actually does support higher learning and science (just look at the STEM programs at BYU and the research they do, etc.). 

How can people reconcile the conflict between ""keep things simple / don't think too much"" and the need to think and analyze the world around us?"	"I'm not sure where you're getting the ""don't try to learn too much"" from this talk. I didn't sense that reading it.

We'd always hook up while her husband was at work, being that he neither had his drivers license or could even drive at all, there was no chance of him walking in on us. So one day I show up for a romp and we get down and dirty, and after we finish I casually ask ""hey do you have a towel or something i can use to clean up?"" and she tosses me some cloth and I wipe myself off. It wasn't until after that i realized she had given me her husbands pajama pants and i wiped our sexjuices off on his pants.

Another time I was visiting while he was home, as he was either totally oblivious or just didn't know how to handle the situation, but we told him i was her ""gay best friend"", which he seemed to believe. He got up to take a shower, during which time I got a blowjob on their couch."

That doesn't seem correct to me, but did anything in the game actually happen?  I know the PoV ceremony was today and that Paul took Jason down, but what made the whole blow up happen?	"Ive only been able to see part so I might be a little off but I think Paul told Alex that Jessica agreed to not save Cody if Paul helped take out Alex next week.

Well Alex being the sheep she is, instead of getting angry at Paul for agreeing to that, confronted Cody (who I guess she trust) with everyone else in the gang right behind her. Cody said he didnt know the deal, leading Alex to confront Jessica and scream that Jessica should have been grateful for Alex ""saving"" her from eviction against Dominique. Jessica naturally told Alex to fuck off as it was Doms meltdown that got her booted not Alexs work.

Then Alex told Raven that Jessica had thrown Raven's name out there when Alex was HOH, leading to Raven having a complete meltdown. Cody and Jessica then went to the hammock, and at Pauls encouragement, everyone went out there and started screaming at them and banging pots. 

When Mark tried to tell everyone to calm down and leave them alone Alex went on a tirade about how Mark betrayed her trust and all that to shut him up. 

After Paul got called to the diary room his sheeples dispersed and everything has gone back to normal. Apparently Josh is back at the pot banging again though. Change that, he just broke a pot."

3636	dkzaj16	dkzy03a	CanadaPolitics	"While this article is generally on-point, I'm going to point out this flaw about our healthcare system:

> Even today, it’s a mishmash by province, and the strains of the system are evident in months- to years-long waits for low-priority treatments such as back surgeries and hip replacements. **Wealthy Canadians can, and do, travel to the United States to receive these treatments.** And they pay for what they get locally, too, in taxes: The nation spends an average of $5,000 per person on health care each year.

I'm tired of hearing this when it's not true. Everyone seems to have a story about their wealthy friend who ran down to Detroit because they were sick of waiting for an MRI, but data just doesn't support the idea that this is an epidemic or anything more than a *very* uncommon occurrence by only the wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians. 

[This widely-cited, peer-reviewed study from 2002](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full) used multiple strategies to evaluate Canadian-to-US healthcare crossings—including contacting hospitals in Washington, Michigan and New York and contacting the 50 best-known and best-ranked hospitals in the United States—and concluded that **""Results from these sources do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States**. Indeed, **the numbers found are so small as to be barely detectible** relative to the use of care by Canadians at home."" [Here's a comprehensive video that cites the study, as well as several other myths about our healthcare system.](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0?t=3m58s)

None of this is to blunt the criticism against Trudeau—he certainly didn't enable our healthcare system to become what it is—but this is a myth that I'm tired of seeing."	How do they obtain personal medical information to come to their conclusions?

There are 2 theories: I was the last one hired and they didn't realize how many 14 year olds would quit in week 1 or 2- Chuck really was the creepy pedophile everyone thought he was and I was a guy. The place almost exclusively hired girls and every guy was eventually fired for very strange reasons. For instance, my friend was fired for ""sweeping the floor wrong"", whatever that's supposed to mean. Never did find out which it was. Creepydude died 15 ish years ago I heard. He and his wife didn't live in town, they lived in an rv and only came to town in the summer. That was the reason given for the bed in the basement, but it conveniently gave ol' Chuck ample material for ""jokes"" to the 14 year old girls. 


And before anyone asks: in my state you could get a work permit to work for a real paycheck at 14 if your parents signed it saying it was ok. "
3645	dgyr7li	dgys7z7	Rainbow6	are you ignoring the fact that you can shoot through most floors?	"Is that your solution to the bunker operator you're suggesting?

Clubhouse Garage, Chalet Garage, House Garage, Yacht Casino, Yacht Subroom, most of Bank's rooms, those are some of the zones/objective areas where your idea would absolutely obliterate everything. You want Montaigne with his extended shield, a recoilless LMG that kills in 2 shots, and 60 bullets per mag."

3647	dgytbhn	dgyxe2g	Broduce101	"> last place as of ep 4 is an A rank.

wtf Mnet pls"	That's from just the live votes + 3000 benefit points. Sangbin was #55 in ep 3, which was the last episode to reveal online vote rankings, thank goodness.
3648	cziv3fb	czj5p6o	AskReddit	"This was asked yesterday and here was my response:

Personal favorites aside from stuff that hasn't been mentioned this far:

How Did This Get Made(Comedy) : June Diane Raphael, Paul Scheer, and Jason Mantzoukas plus guest discuss bad films. 

Risk! (storytelling): my favorite storytelling podcast. Hosted by Kevin Allison(formerly of The State), people tell true stories that are funny, scary, deeply emotional, et cetera. 

Last Podcast on the Left(comedy/horror): these guys discuss all things scary with a bit of comedy mixed in. Their serial killers editions are probably the best. 

Honorable mention... 

We're Alive(serial audio drama): probably the best audio drama out there. It's a zombie apocalypse one in the vein of TWD, but I dig it and they're about a half hour long per episode. 

Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/43f0nu/i_know_nothing_about_podcasts_what_would_be_an/"	I tried to listen to Risk but the host is just obnoxious as all hell :/
3649		czjenvf	Charlotte		Comrads, instead of attacking each other, why do t we make a common enemy out of Atlanta ga. or that backwards hole called Gastonia?
3650		dkzww3i	PUBATTLEGROUNDS		yes. they've said they plan to launch a squad version, but they want to test things like FoV and such first to try and iron out any issues. being as squad is the most popular server and has the highest amount of players, its not good for ironing out issues.
3651		dgyyeeq	AskWomen		"In the 8th grade I hit a major bout of depression. I only ate maybe one small meal a day, which was dinner with my family. I was 110 lbs and 5'5"". It was really bad, as some days I'd skip dinner too by taking depression naps.

The summer between 8th and 9th grade I started dating my SO and he gently encouraged me to start eating more regularly. It hurt so much to eat more than one meal a day and it made me nauseous. I felt like I just couldn't fit more than one meal a day in me.

I'm now ending my freshman year of college and I'm within an average weight range for my height and age. I still don't eat a lot, maybe one meal and a few snacks throughout the day. If I eat ""too much"", which usually is a big plate full of food, I feel sick and in pain, but I can eat more than I could before. I still have days where I don't feel hungry and I don't wsnt to eat, but I force myself to anyways because of how easily I can go without food now"
3652		dkzr65r	ChapoTrapHouse		I think at this point his ideology is just second-option bias. The cultural Marxist regressive left hates him? He must be worth listening to!
3653		dgywq2q	Greekgodx		What a totally baseless, shitty thing to say.
3654	czj5582	czja0w9	Showerthoughts	"This is a mistake made by many, many, many people.

**YOU CANNOT GET A SIX PACK WITH SIT UPS ALONE. YOU NEED TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AS WELL.**"	"Only if you are fat to begin with. Which is most Americans. Which started this fucking annoying excuse that abs are made in the kitchen. They are not. I've always been below 10% body fat and my abs didn't show until I trained them. 

Sure. Everybody has ""abs"" but you really can't see them without working out unless you're fuckig 6% body fat or less. 

"
3655		dkzw76b	Mariners		Canó pls
3656	czjdz7t	czjeam4	BDSMcommunity	[verwijderd]	"Hm. I think it depends on the sub. Chastity and orgasm denial have its place, but it's rarely forever. Guys put up with it because when sex does happen, when an orgasm is allowed, it's usually mind-blowingly awesome if the denial and the chastity was done correctly for their specific personalities. 

I have heard of nonsexual power exchange, especially from married couples where one person is kinky and the other is not, and no one is comfortable quite yet with their significant other having a sexual relationship with another. The ironic part is that D/s and power exchange is so intimate even without sex. 

It does seem common for straight Dommes to be into chastity. Whether that's a straight female thing or not is beyond my wisdom though. ha. I'm not male but I'm with you. A sexless relationship is -not- what I want and I would end a relationship that turned out to be sexless.

3658		dkzpgj4	AskReddit		Be completely stuffed with food, and then go for more
3659		czjfwdu	skiutah		"The chutes around Paradise are a sweet start. Powder Country is always good for cutting fresh lines/trees. If you can rip Lightning Ridge or James Peak....you are winning the game. Powder Mountain isn't the toughest mountain in terms of ""pitch"" but has some of the gnarliest terrain around if ya know where to look."
3660	dkzrl0k	dkzy057	AskOuija	[verwijderd]	L
3661	dkzr75a	dkzxm6r	DaystromInstitute	"I thought ""transwarp"" was a catchall term for all technologies that go faster than warp 10.

This would include the quantum slipstream, transwarp, both STIII and Voyager, underspace, and the method used in ""The Voyager Conspiracy""."	Faster than typical warp, yes. Warp 10 is infinite (in the TNG scale), so you can't go faster than that. 
3662		dgytotf	SkincareAddiction		You should try the Simple replenishing rich moisturizer. It is tailored for sensitive skin and is also dimethicone free. My pores clog crazy easily and this is the only thing I have found works for me. It is really inexpensive also. 
3663		dkzrila	Paranormal		I used to work at Disney California Adventure and had a minor run in with the little girl that haunts Buena Vista Street's Trolley Treats store. She apparently is a little prankster and I thought it was funny.
3664		dgyubxv	AskReddit		Id say I've got one close friend. Since middle school. We talk about everything and hang out often. Tak often. Game often. Pretty much got eachothers backs. Thats how friends should be
3665		czj7vn1	Surface		"If they are not responding, maybe you should look elsewhere. Could be a scammer looking for quick cash.

3670	czgkg1s	czj671x	Bitcoin	"> and 2MB hard fork is clearly not destructive for the network and decentralization.

This is my whole frustration.  2MB isn't going to break anything or cause centralization, so why can't everyone get onboard with it?  I understand not moving to 20MB or 200MB, but 2MB?  What's the big deal?  Do people think it'll be a slippery slope or something?"	"Why are you whining like a baby over 2MB when 1.75MB is already being rolled out? Are you that pathetic that you can't wait for the next doubling already on the horizon on the roadmap?

There's not a single valid reason you can come up with to do 2MB before SW. But since you already buried your head in the sand earlier you put yourself in a position where you'd lose face if you don't get your demands met.

You've been given plenty of opportunity to get your head out of your ass without much loss of face.

The mere fact that you think there's even a possibility of setting demands and making compromises displays the degree of misunderstanding you have. This is science at work not some miss America competition."

3679		dkztr10	FFBraveExvius		"Delita is evil. He is the monster that he sought to destroy and while he is perhaps sympathetic, he murders or betrays everyone in his quest for power. Ovelia tries to give him his just rewards but unfortunately fails.

You have a very....generous interpretation of events. I haven't played either version since the WotL release on PSP, but I've played this game a dozen times so I'm gonna try and poke at them.

&gt;Delita then uncovers a traitorous councilor to Goltanna and executes him, earning Goltanna's favor. 

My impression is that the councilor was a fall guy for Delita's actions, who actually was the spy. It's possible he was another spy, but likely Delita simply framed him for the Hokuto plot and murdered him to get him out of the way and gain Goltana's trust. The only evidence is a witness that Delita himself provides, and he kills him before any objections can be made.


&gt; Delita successfully kills Goltanna, but instead of killing Orlandeau, Delita kills a lookalike and lets the real TG Cid go with Ramza in his search for the church's true goal. Delita then assumes Goltanna's position as head of the Southern Sky.

I've seen the idea that Delita let Orlandu go, but this is highly unlikey. The stand-in that Delita kills is a member of the Glabados church provided for the purpose of framing Orlandu for Goltana's murder (this is explicit in the japanese version that he's a member of the church). There's no reason to let Orlandu go except to betray the Templar knights (of which Delita is a member), and there's no way the church would provide a stand-in to help betray themselves. Further, Orlandu walks away with one of the Auracites when Ramza busts him out of jail. Considering the Templars gave him that stone, they had to have known that Orlandu escaped with it and Delita killed a stand-in or else they would have come looking for their stone to give to someone else to use.


&gt; At the same time, Valmafra, learning of Delita's betrayal as he speaks to Orran, struggles to carry out her orders to kill Delita. Delita senses her hesitation, and taunts her to kill him. Instead, Valmafra abandons her orders and serves Delita.

Does she? Or does he just capture her until after he becomes king?

&gt; Finally, Orran tries to uncover the church's plot and is burned at the stake as a heretic; it is unknown what power Delita had to stop this event.

The power of being the most powerful man in the country. If Delita didn't want Orran to die, he wouldn't have let Orran die.

&gt;  Delita spared Ramza several times, as well as spared Orlandeau

The second is questionable at best. The first is just not true. Delita never tries to fight Ramza, and given that he relies on Ramza to slay the Lucavi instead of trying to do so himself, it's unlikely he would have emerged triumphant. He probably also knew this having grown up with him, and hence never tried. Besides, as you point out, Ramza was needed for that whole Lucavi problem.

Delita MEANS well, but he becomes a black-hearted fiend at the end. Ovelia recognized it. Everyone else should as well."

I mainly fear about display. One my friend own tablet from classic brand (I mean that it was some older type hp elite) and he used non standard cover with keyboard which was poorly positioned magnets (a little bit closer to the screen when was cover closed) and after longer time on tablet started piffle (or what is right word) display

So, if is true that is all same in sp3keyboard and sp4keyboard (magnets too) so it's nice information for me. Save me some money. Because before I sold my sp3 so I was okay with sp3keyboard so I will not need newest."	It is all universal, if you really wanted to you could use the original type cover with a sp4.

3717	dgytip0	dgz10an	LifeProTips	"Even worse than that, there are a lot of things in life that you can't easily explain to another person when they ask, ""what's wrong?""   There are medical conditions people don't know about, family trauma that isn't as simple as an abusive or narcissistic parent (not that I'm downplaying those by any means), and lastly there are things that we can be exposed to that simply change us permanently and there really isn't any going back.   Attempting to explain these things to others usually ends with them being trivialized or marginalized because nobody likes hearing about a problem that can't be explained in under a minute, because then they regret having asked the question.   Remember that many times when people ask the question, ""what's wrong?"",  they don't actually want to know,  they just want the dopaminic release that comes with the belief that you somehow helped somebody with 45 seconds of listening.    Sometimes you just have to carry it with you and keep it to yourself.  And if you do find someone that actually cares, that spends the time to fully comprehend what it is you are going through, then you better make time for them as well, because they are rare and they deserve a full listen as well.

Yes, depending upon what you want to do with it.

So there are two types of dash cameras in this generation with parking mode. 1) With excellent parking modes, but only good-fair video quality; 2) With Excellent video quality, but lackluster parking mode.

Excellent parking mode is: Automatically enable/disable (lackluster is very painful in this department), Buffered recording (able to record a few seconds before, and after action detected), low power when in use (only writes to micro SD card when motion activated detected), voltage cut off feature (to protect battery.)

&gt; 2. Is having a parking mode feature worth it?

So is it worth it, well dual cameras definitely [improve parking mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGWGX1t8DU0). Do you back into the spot 100% of the time? Most don't. Even if you do, [you can be hit from behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhIXOxjyko).

Hardwiring is a little more difficult, I actually like GPS (speed/location only not directions), built in Wifi definitely improves your ability to check video, change settings, over a LCD screen. Some of the Parking mode dash cams have Cloud feature (stream anywhere - paid feature) and cellphone notifications of G sensor activation(s) while in park mode (generally free feature.) Some have excellent night mode, like the Thinkware F770 2 CH. 


Others are simply vehicle on dash cams, like the A119 - Excellent video quality day, good night, good shadow, lackluster park mode. You can hardwire this to hide wires, but most hardwire to an outlet that is only powered when the ignition is on.

----

I would say Excellent Park mode worth it, dual cam worth it, wifi worth it, GPS worth it, and being discreet is definately worth it.

In the 70s, cigarettes were a major contributor to starting house fires and congress had asked cigarette manufacturers to develop a self-extinguishing product. Rather than develop said product, they reached into the money bags and lobbied to have flame retardants put into furniture to help mitigate the risk of an unexstinguished cigarette. 

What do you know? Congress took the money and brought in requirements for flame retardant materials to be used in furniture construction. 

The reality - flame retardants have allowed for synthetic materials to become more prevalent in modern furniture. These synthetic materials release higher amounts of toxic smoke that fill a room replacing the oxygen and leading to hotter, and more quickly progressing fires.

How admirable of them. They can recognize holiness even in people who disagree with them."" And when I saw this morning at morning prayer in the BCP that it was St. Ignatius' feast day, I didn't think twice about it, because I'd already concluded the Anglicans are more open-minded than the Catholics in such matters.

I don't know about some of the other people venerated in the Anglican calendar that you all have mentioned already, but I always thought that the Catholic Church ought to canonize C. S. Lewis, and found it quite small-minded that they wouldn't. "	"How could the Catholic Church canonize C. S. Lewis, who was never a part of their church? It has absolutely nothing to do with being ""small-minded"" but simply with them adhering to their ecclesiology. Just because someone really was a good person or even a great Christian doesn't mean that we *ought* to formally commemorate them as a saint of the church. It's true that C. S. Lewis is a greatly admired figure among many Catholics today but it still doesn't change the fact that they were never in communion with him, *and how could any church presume to commemorate someone they didn't know in the Eucharistic body?* 

This doesn't mean that private veneration of saints outside the Church or even saints that haven't been officially commemorated can't occur, and I actually do know a handful of people, including myself, that venerate saints outside of our respective communions. But the public, corporate veneration of saints in our official calendars is a completely different story, and the current state of some of our Anglican Calendars is laughable. "

3870		dkzpfug	Anxiety		"Firstly, I am sorry you have to go through such things. Alone each one is hard to deal with, so having a combination of issues is always much harder to get under control. As far as telling them goes.... Do you feel it would have a positive or negative impact on your life and/or mental health help? I personally feel it's always best to inform anyone you have daily interactions with, such as close family members, significant others, and closest friends. I feel this way because it helps them to better understand you, your actions and reactions to situations, and how to help when there's noticable behavior changes. It gives you a chance to build a support group within loved ones. If they are like my family was, which it sounds as though they are, maybe having pamphlets or literature for them to read that is science based to read themselves, as you break the news to them. Ignorance of a certain mental health condition can have a huge impact on how the conversation will go and how they accept what you have and deal with on a daily basis. Generalized opinions of conditions are worse to ""break through"" than if someone just doesn't know what it is at all. I attempted telling my aunt about my ocd paraphrasing studies and research mixing in my opinion and personal struggles. It went horribly. She was not only confused but overwhelmed and it caused her to basically shut down on me. So, when I brought the issues to my mother and step dad about a month later, I had gathered pamphlets and even printed out short articles and explanations of said disorder from medical sites. I had in depth breakdowns for later reads for them once they grasped the basic concepts. This method was very successful and after a few days, once she accepted I had mental issues and I assume replayed my life and now understood so many things I'd done growing up that she hadn't previously, she came to me with questions and the door was open for discussion and understanding. So, literature always helps unknowing parties grasp the basics and may allow for deeper insight. Another thing to consider is, do you feel you could better approach them once you have seen a professional and gained more knowledge yourself? Would being treated first benefit you more, via therapy or meds or both, in how you handle Thier reactions to the info drop? Each person is different in what approach is best for them, as well as each family in accepting said info and how they respond to it. Majority of Parents know when something is wrong or not right with Thier children, so it may go a lot better than one may think. Then again, parents also tend to see and not believe because its hard to fathom you have a child with mental health problems. Often you see the parent feeling it's Thier fault, they did xx or xx wrong and caused it, or some sort of outside factor causing it. That's why it's important to provide short to the point medical and science based info for them to read. Sorry for the jumble mumble and it not being well organized or written. Super tired but wanted to offer my 2 cents and tiny bit of how I went about it personally with my family. Just remember to not overwhelm yourself or your ocd will get worse. Also, have a plan of action in place with lots of info ready and list key talking points. Short n Sweet, until they are ready to dive deep with you. Best wishes and luck to you!!!

I have classmates that did a ""Career Discovery"" type program that some schools offer during the summer. They did theirs at Cal and I know the GSD has one too. It's designed for people like you to get some work done in a studio setting and figure out if you like it. And it helps when you apply to grad school. 

Good luck!"	Thank you! I will eventually be taking design classes, and I actually have a permaculture design due next weekend (but it's not so much it is about aesthetic appeal as it is applying permacultural conventions and pure functionality). I just wanted to try to get a jump start on this so I don't go into design classes completely inept as I suspect some people on my track will.

That's the thing, we're always thinking about this from a human point of view, technologically and behaviourally, when we can't assume anything at all about a significantly advanced culture.

1. Firstly, it is a legal issue. I support legalization. Whatever your position in the morality of cannabis or any other substance for that matter, the questions ""should you use it"" and ""should the government try to stop you from using it"" are far too often conflated. 

2. Second, it is a moral issue. You are right that there is no specific prohibition on this according to the bible, at least as far as I am aware. Therefore, it is up to everyone's own personal feelings, and people of the same religion may make different choices. As long as it does not control your life, that is. 

3. Thirdly, it is a health issue. In some cases cannabis can actually be used to ease the pain of highly uncomfortable conditions. Drugs, in general, are of course bad for you (though not even as bad as alcohol) and so I steer away from it personally for this reason. "

Give her simple, clear directions and never any real responsibility (no babysitting) and then don't get too surprised or upset if she fails or messes up something. Only tell her things you don't mind everyone else knowing, and smile and nod and correct her like you would a child who is learning the ropes socially. Try to engage her but also keep her at arms length - she will be in your life forever, so how you react to her will determine how unhappy this fact makes you. If you treat her like an adult toddler who just can't help being sort of obnoxious and overbearing and over excited and gently but firmly correct her every time or just walk away then it won't really get your goat so badly.

It's when you put the expectation of a fully grown adult person on her that you'll be disappointed. Just remember always that she's kind of a loud social ditz and treat accordingly "

3905	dkzvwvl	dkzx42q	FORTnITE	"We sort of discussed this below. For visibility, here is my breakdown, fleshed out for all tiers:

**A Tier** Great single target damage and group dps increase.

* Urban Assault - consistent, high dps across a range of weapons due to increased reload speed, (40%), rate of fire while head shotting (50%), and kneecapper. A non-upgraded goin' commando and frag grenade help with basic wave clear. If provided war cry, this soldier is a dps monster. Stack with special forces or warlord.

* Special Forces - good sustained damage with assault rifles (24% extra damage and 40% reload). Great individual wave clear with grenades, fast cooldown, boosted war cry, and going commando. War cry and commando can be used in combination for extreme wave clear, including obliterating mist monsters. Also, 60s war cry with 15s duration works well with a coordinated team. A crit based Ranger, Commando, Urban Assault, or another Special Forces really work well in a group.

**B Tier** Requires team coordination or support to excel

* Warlord - powerful war cry with larger radius to pick up a spread out team. Powerful goin' commando which can be stacked with said war cry for wave clear or mist monsters.

* Commando - Powerful goin' commando and kneecapper. Needs to be paired with another soldier who offers war cry to truly be effective. Dps monster when given war cry. 6 grenades to work with in between goin' commando usage.

**C Tier** Lack either single target DPS or consistent wave clear

* Support Specialist - Only if you have access to a good explosive weapon, otherwise D tier due to no reload, rate of fire, or damage perks. No durability loss during warcry, stacked with a good rocket launcher or grenade launcher, is quite powerful in a pinch.

* Centurion - Overvalued by many due to kneecapper. Decent team support but without said team focusing on all hard targets, which a lot of the time isn't viable, she simply doesn't offer much.

* Master Grenadier - Inconsistent DPS due to dependency on grenades, without a cooldown for their regen. No weapon damage perks or other dps aside from a base goin' commando.

**D Tier** Trade damage for defense

* Shock Trooper - Shock wave is only useful in specific scenarios and lacks DPS compared to the top tier soldiers. I don't want gimmicks in a soldier skill set, I want optimal dps and wave clear.

* Survivalist

* Rescue Trooper"	Awesome thanks. Do rare heroes get access to kneecapped or is it only the epic/legendary version?

3915	czj3aji	czjddcc	MakingaMurderer	"> I know that they were all working together on the first Avery conviction

But you are wrong, because neither Lenk nor Colborn were working for MCSD during the first case. Colborn didn't join MCSD til 1996. Lenk joined in 1988.

Colborn transferred the phone call, which did not mention the names Allen or Avery, or the specific crime, to a detective. This is what his deposition was about. 

"	"Watch episode 2 again. An ADA named Jones gave a deposition about a phone conversation he had with Kusche that they were all lying. That they all knew exactly who the call was about in 95 and sat on it. Kusche didn't deny it. Colborn wrote his report the day after Avery got out because he knew the person from Brown county could expose him anytime if he had written down notes on his end. 

MCSD was so screwed if nothing had gotten in the way of that lawsuit. Do you really think Steven Avery is the only person who got unfair treatment? Every person those officers and Vogel help arrest or convict were about to have serious grounds to have their cases  looked at. That's not even bringing potential financial ruin into the equation. 

All they had to do was stay away from the investigation, that's it. They couldn't, why? Because they were going to make sure the conviction stuck this time.

And although they like that the Dutch healthcare system is actually affordable, it's kind of... strange to navigate. My male friend broke his arm playing baseball.

Have you tried LM and becca on each side of your face in Sephora and then looked at yourself in different lighting? I think you're the only one who can make the final decision esp as to whether the highlighter lasts on you after wearing it around! 

I'm going to have to recommend becca champagne pop because it surprisingly is very easily sheered out. I get a seriously natural glow with a stippling brush and it lasts. And obviously it can be crazy or medium or slight glow if you want it to. I did worry as to whether it had microglitter but it doesn't show at all on my face and I'm really particular about not being glittery, just very naturally slightly glowy.

Now, as for which Parks, I'm fairly well versed in East-End parks &amp; can give some tips if you have questions on specific parks. Glen Stewart, like a lot of Toronto green space, is a ravine. Specifically, it's a lovely series of walking paths through a heavily forrested ravine. 

There's not a lot of space for you to have a ceremony that wouldn't be in a walking path &amp; if the weather's nice, it will be a trafficked, though not crazy busy, path.

Now, the ravine aspect. The spring means a lot of the ravine green spaces are quite wet. While this could make them less trafficked, there is a reason.

I'll think on it &amp; see if I can come up with a good suggestion. In the meantime​, I would suggest browsing the city's park website, it is a good resource. If you think you find a good match, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

Me, wife, two friends and one set of our parents. All in an eight seat Toyota. West coast of Sri Lanka. I was the first to spot the waves coming over the breakwater rocks. Ten seconds later, the driver has stopped the car, gotten out and doesn't get back in in time. The water rises, quickly and starts moving the car. It is too late to open the doors. We roll windows down, and just watch the slow-mo ride that takes us three hundred feet to a half-built building. Three of us get out through windows, get on the roof of the car and literally walk across to the roof of the building. We still have three people trapped inside with no way to get out. 

Ten seconds later, the wave subsides a bit, and the car drops back to ground level. Everyone gets out. 

It is a mad scene. People in shock, except for random, occasional wailing. Wife tries to resuscitate an old lady, without luck. We try to help motorists get their cars off the train track, except that there is absolutely zero chance a train is coming down that line in the next two years. Finally, we get a call from a friend who warns us about subsequent waves. We all book it up a hill nearby. Lucky to have everyone survive. Luckier than a lot of families nearby. 

This shit happens fast- too fast for untrained people to react. If you get out of the car, count yourself lucky. If your car doesn't catch something underwater and roll over, lucky again.

3944		dkzto3v	GameStop		We have nothing to give thanks for since we all failed the company so hard this year shame on us all
3945		dgythx1	Astros		This team is stacked. Francona said it best. We are built for October. 
3946		czjd000	rwbyRP		"Robert would wish for a break. At any given moment, he is almost always sleeping, eating, training, in class, doing homework, or working. Ain't no rest for the wicked, and Robert wants very much to be able to relax, even for just a little bit.

Sorry this is so short and simple, but he has simple tastes, and isn't very clever."
3947		dgyxb9y	AskReddit		Huntsville Alabama Syndrome, you will like rockets
3948		dkzylfl	OFWGKTA		Do you know what the tittles of the videos were called? If you tell me the tittle I'll be able to help
3949	czimqlt	czjbiqf	Fallout	Well some people have 3.	4 if you're Krogan.
3950		dgz1owk	TibiaMMO		In Tibia 11 Battle window you could disable the monsters so you only ser your party members, and attack mobs clicking on game window. Another option is order alphabeticaly ascendant or descendant depending on the mobs you are hunting so the Knight stays on top of the list.

what you did there...i see it"	Someone gets it
3952	dkzr7lm	dkzry0s	AskDocs	Fuck no. I would otherwise have a painful sore on my tongue that would eventually have rotted my face off.	fuck cancer indeed.
3953	dkztx5g	dkzwy8f	aihl	Did you end up making it to a game last weekend? If not, there's only one weekend left in Perth. Definitely worth checking out even if we are set to belt the Adrenaline both nights.	No, my wife got the flu so I was stuck playing nurse at home. 
3954		czjf08j	RoastMe		The pages in all those books are probably stuck together
3955	dkzxgfn	dkzxhs9	AskReddit	"I know you're being sarcastic, but I know people (a lot, both male and female) that are like that. A lot of girls I've rejected are really not all that appearance wise, and I offer to set them up with one of my more average friends but they always decline thinking he is below them.

If you're being sincere, uh, cool :) "	I'm actually being sincere 
3956		dgyuvma	DotA2		and I still don't know what OG means
3957	dgy67ob	dgyxwlg	GlobalOffensive	Yeah, I really dislike when people overuse emojis so can we please stop?	"Well I dislike being queued with Silver 4 skill MEATBOTS.

3959		czj748t	AskReddit		I'm sure someone at some point has had every viewpoint I've ever had.
3960	dkzsdg6	dkztqir	SquaredCircle	How do we know he hates them? A common conservative belief if that they don't want to accept refugees into the country. That tweet was a way of expressing that.	Its fine not wanting to accept refugees, but to refer to them as muslim invaders is racist and disrespectful
3961	dgyud5m	dgyudya	SquaredCircle	Why does Matt need so many pockets on his ring gear? Does he not get a locker backstage to keep his keys and such?	Where else is he gonna keep his green beans? 
3962	dkzx7bx	dkzx8vr	Astros	Ohgreatmorebitchingaboutsipp.jpg	who cares if we bitch about Sipp, he's the worst pitcher i've ever seen in my life, and frankly the shit people say about him is hilarious.
3963		dkzs424	DecemberBumpers2017		I am not a teacher but a science lab tech in a high school. Hopefully I'd work til the last day and they would roll me over to my hospital a block away. I only have 6 or 8 weeks fully paid maternity leave so if things go right I'd be back by midterms which is just proctoring a few times. Don't think my supervisor would get a sub for my spot. The teachers could just stop doing labs for a few weeks before I head back. 
3964		dgyx8qp	TapTitans2		Hi there, I am from Australia looking to join the clan. My current stage is at 1200, can do CQ frequently when it is made available besides when sleeping. 
3965		dgyunzf	AskReddit		I would beg him to kick Massachusetts out, i want to get the fuck out. 
3966	dkzlt16	dkzr33v	Disgaea	"Thanks to everyone who responded, this was exactly what I was looking for (upvotes for all)  Can I get one more point of clarity?

Majes2 said 
""*Every* reincarnation will increase your base stats and growths, depending on your class mastery, and the total # of levels earned across all live""

Then Laharlsblade said

""Reincarnation in this game is honestly pretty pointless after the first time, since mastering every class and then leveling from 1 to 9999 while in the Elite Four squad will get your unit max stats from leveling up (10 million). Any additional stats you gain from reincarnations will do nothing.""

Trying to make sense of both comments.  Does that mean that reincarnating could increase your states every time you do it, but it is not necessary to do so because there is a cap on leveling your stats which can be reached by only doing 5 reincarnations + Elite four squad?

I guess what I'm trying to say is, how many times am I supposed to reincarnate a single character in order to get him as high as I can?  Is it every time he masters a class, every time he hits 9999, or just however many times it takes to get to 10,000,000 stats?

Thanks all!
"	"In past iterations of Disgaea, reincarnation used to be a big thing. In this one, you max your subclasses on a character and then reincarnate in the Elite Four squad + Raised Flag (for non-monster characters) will net you a base stat total of around 10mil in each stat. 

You _can_ reincarnate more for bonus points, but the bonuses they give you are tiny compared to the bonuses you can get from later gear, especially carnage gear. That's why it's pointless, in a sense, to reincarnate more than once or twice. "
3967	czhjmjf	czjczxs	TrueAtheism	"I'm not surrounded by unusually religious people. In fact, my experience is a lot like the other guy/girl. Seems pretty secular.

I don't go on the internet and brag that my whole region is secular or that other areas of the country are totally religious garbage pits of vitriolic political debates and whatnot."	"&gt;I don't go on the internet and brag that my whole region is secular

You are the one that asked where in the US is secular, so don't complain when people respond.

Lots of people on this subreddit post about people they know from school or work or social activities asking them about their religious beliefs and and objecting to their atheism. It was important to swallow-thekey's story to say that they've never experienced anything like this due to always having lived in a secular area."
3968		czjcufa	AskReddit		I'm an English teacher, but I also feel qualified to teach Physical Education
3969		dgyua6n	RocketLeagueExchange		lime fsl for 4 keys?
3970		czj83e2	Catholicism		He trippin.
3971	dkzncv2	dkzrtv4	AskReddit	And then someone says you should've saved up money for this as though you aren't going through enough and that's not always an option. Are you any better, now. How's your kid?	Doing great. She's a beautiful, healthy, 2 year old.
3972	dgy872p	dgyulhp	AskReddit	Think of it as extreme hand-holding.	Finally an explanation I can get behind! 
3973	czj7p5r	czj8eyc	AskReddit	Who is champ? 	THAT QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED!
3974	czj98um	czjdfgn	Calligraphy	"Same here, even just with a normal fountain pen.

If I'm after a cheapish notepad that looks like a Moleskin I'll normally go for a Daycraft - paper seems to be a bit heavier and fountain pen friendly. Not sure if you could really use it for calligraphy though"	I've never used these personally but they definitely caught my eye http://www.gouletpens.com/leuchtturm1917-hard-cover-notebooks/c/93
3975		dgyxuje	SquaredCircle		get hindered bih
3976	dkznyrf	dkzpfi2	DotA2	"Just more people wanting the world to do everything for them.

There is always a risk while traveling internationally.

You don't get denied unless there is some sort of red flag, could be a mistake or something you are unaware of."	Maybe Valve did make some mistake? We don't know the full story. Don't go around assuming people are blindly blaming others.
3977		dkzvbmz	WRX		Try a lease man. They're typically easier to get. Take that $10k with you and your monthly payments will be super low. By the time you need to buy it out with a loan, your credit should be better. 
3978	dkzg8ax	dkzpiya	PS4	No thanks.	Also. Drake driving a go kart no thanks... this isnt 1999
3979	dgysbp2	dgz1nul	CGPGrey2	"All those in favor, say Aye. 
Edit: The Ayes have it. Chris has been formally adopted as the name of the Anti-Tim. Thank you to u/nicbudd for listening for Nay votes."	Aye!
3980		dkzvq2t	AskReddit		Graphic novel, but Sandman is amazing.
3981	dgz1bi2	dgz1i50	DestinyTheGame	As long as that is the **only** thing they take from the division I find that acceptable.	As someone who played division, agreed. 
3982	dgyyji8	dgyyoed	Amd	"I understand you probably don't have a lot of time and maybe not the interest for it but if you can try out The Witcher 3. The graphics are astounding and it's got some nice mechanics and story .


Or you can just battle your way through traffic in cities skylines .it's always hell to manage traffic after 80k population "	I might give it a try.  But I'm afraid I'll get to get a new GPU after!!!
3983	czizuc2	czj5e9n	magicTCG	:( Sadness has gone on the stack and resolved	Before sadness resolves, I play hope. It has split second.
3984		czj5uoi	AskReddit		"Not the weirdest, but fullest collection of seriously mispronounced words

Melk milk
Tunhouse townhouse
Pellow pillow
Lightball lightbulb

The list actually goes on, but i knew this kid 10 years ago, hard to remember "
3985		dkzv1sm	The_Donald		Some of the F35 stories could be psyops. Its radar cross section (RCS) is superb, making it very stealthy hence avoiding a direct fight which would not be good for it. Legitimate issues concern the fuel consumption rate, low weapons load, and complicated / potentially vulnerable to electronic warfare software systems.
3986		dgyxkoc	The_Donald		Killary wants women covered up so they don't entice Bill. It's not complicated.
3987	dgymai7	dgysbu1	RocketLeagueExchange	I'm getting offered heat hexed and para for my 20xx is that a good deal?	yes it is. that's pretty much the standard trade right now
3988	dkzhgsa	dkzvhpk	Swingers	"I want to stay positive...but I'm having a really hard time not calling bullshit on this.

Have you guys ever met a couple on SDC or something and when you get to talking you find out only one of them chats and the stories just sounds a little too ""Penthouse letters?""

This reminds me of that. 

You went to a house party with 30 people in it...and everyone wanted to fuck everyone else...and there was a giant orgy and a pile of bodies and an all you can eat dick buffet? Does this sound like the friendliest bunch of people ever? 

It sounds like what someone who has never been thinks those parties usually go down. 

But hey good for you if it happened. Sounds like
You had a blast.
"	We host or go to house parties at least once a month. It is hit or miss at times, but have seen plenty of these parties turn into orgies. Not uncommon. 
3989		czj4eva	TwoXChromosomes		[removed]
3990		dkzq61n	Goldfish		"poor fish :( good on you for helping out!

&gt;anyone know what the minimum time to wait for water to be safe to add to the tank?

unless you have chemicals, I would give it 24 hours. 

we have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Goldfish/wiki/index) with a few guides that may set you down the right path. best you can do now is get him a large large storage container and let that water sit overnight. 3gal is way too small even for a temp tank. Every bit of water counts. "
3991	czjbu1i	czjcgpp	DotA2	[verwijderd]	None of this matters because it didn't happen. They had to go OUT OF THEIR way to stop this. It took all of .5 seconds to start that combo and the reaction time necessary for that is what makes this unfun. 
3992	dkzq4lx	dkzshhe	Destiny	So in your mind, someone taking a second to compose their thoughts mean that they lost a debate?  Are you stupid?  Man you're easily conned.  No wonder trump is president when this country is full of people like you that care about style over substance.	Yeah, a large part of debating (in this format) is demeanor and appearance. If you can't command the stage then you lose the debate.
3993	dkzw2si	dkzwebx	ShitWehraboosSay	[verwijderd]	"Communist untermench was a joke on a game's sub reddit. 

And just because I am disgruntled by the culture of Europe being flushed down the toilet I'm not a neonazi"
3994		czje7jn	FreeCodeCamp		"There's been some discussion about this in the FCC chatroom about Curriculum Development. Other people feel this way too, and the controversy is over whether it should be shifted to the back of the projects, or kept at the front.

Some people feel that it's actually too difficult as a first project; many find the quote machine and pomodoro to be easier. Depends on the person I guess."
3995	dkyuklq	dkzph5c	Conservative	"It's the correct legal term.  The DOJ using ""illegal alien"" is like a doctor using ""penis"" or ""vagina"".

If someone is made uncomfortable by the use of the correct term, then the problem is with that person, not the people saying it.
"	Um, excuse me, I find those terms incredibly offensive. I prefer wiener and whooha thank you. /s
3996		dgywjt3	The_Donald		How important is climate change honestly? Like is it really as catastrophic and immediate as leftists claim it to be?
3997		czjfroe	Denver		Damn, I'm flying back into Denver on Monday night. I hope I don't get cancelled, too. 
3998		dgyyb2h	LosAngeles		Not trying to be mean, but...the time and energy spent complaining about something you can't do anything about would be better spent addressing and fixing your low credit score. Obviously, you've had trouble paying bills in the past with that score. They're only protecting themselves. It's not their fault you have a low credit score.  Or, you could sit in the dark with no water.

4008	dgyzxa6	dgz163n	WorldOfWarships	Speaking as someone who doesn't own a Des Meme, so take it as you will. Isn't AA mod 3 kind of a waste. you've already got so much AA power that it feels a little wasted. Popping DFAA will still melt everything in the air even without AAmod3. Would the extra 2 salvos a minute from the reload mod not be a bit better? Not saying there is a right way to play, and mod 3 tends to mostly be preference. 	Extra reload or range is absolutely the better choice, DM already has such retard AA that buffing the DPS any further is pretty much a waste of time and points. DM only needs AFT and AA range to be a god tier AA fortress.

Some of those bollard type 2 foot high sticks you can plow through and other stop you dead. You can knock over a light post with just a tap but a 4 foot high bush will literally stop a tank.

If that hadn't been her plate, was he going to just keep guessing numbers until he got it right?

4029	czjb1fz	czjbp6g	DebateAChristian	"I would like to bring to light the tendency for theists to attribute unlikely events to the intervention of a god. It is true that there are many incredibly unlikely events that happen in our world that would be truly dumbfounding if we ever experienced them. However what many fail to realize is that unlikely events happen *all the time.* This is because there is quite literally an infinite number of cosmic dice rolling going on every second of the day, and when you have infinite chances for an unlikely event to happen, that event will then become incredibly likely to happen *somewhere*. 

[Consider that the chance of an apocalyptic asteroid striking the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event#Frequency_and_risk) any given year is one in 440,000 (.0002%). This is another way of saying that such an asteroid strikes the Earth every 440,000 years. At any given year, the chance remains the same, but what you find if you wait 440,000 years is that the probability of it happening ex post facto becomes 63%. The probability that it will strike continues to rise each passing year. The probability is described as such:

1 - (1 - P)^n

Extrapolate this to any event, such as a person becoming miraculously cured of cancer. What you get is an occasional, mind boggling and seemingly supernatural defiance of probability. Unlikely events happen all the time."	"Preach it bro!  Applied statistician here.  A wonderful book on this topic is Innumeracy by John Allen Paulos.

4043	dkzl40l	dkzom2l	IDontWorkHereLady	"Well I have a ferret and am poor and in school so I just give her regular food but I know of people with cats and dogs who feed their pets vegan pet food. It's not too extreme when you think about it. Yes the animals naturally eat meat but when you buy pet food that isn't meat is it? It's tiny little bread nuggets and lots of dog foods already advertise adding vegetables to the mix. Pet food is made from baby chickens and parts from sick or long dead animals they can't give to people so really it's not the best thing for your pet. The vegan alternatives fortify the food with the nutrients the animals need just like the regular foods do. 

"	"Actually, dogs are not obligate carnivores. They have a mutation (a similar one is found in humans) that lets them digest grains better than their wild relatives. So some vegetables and grains isn't a bad addition to their diet, though I would still recommend  a dogfood low in grains and with meat as the first ingrediant. And even then their teeth, digestive system and nutritional needs are suited for a diet high in meat. They can live on a vegan diet, with the right supplements, but it's not at all what their body is suited for.
Cats absolutely are obligate carnivores, they can not digest plants very well. Even the best vegan catfood is as unnatural and unhealthy for them as a diet of solely meat would be for a rabbit or cow.

As for the stuff the petfood is made of, that depends on what  kind you buy. Some is  as you put it ""bread nuggets"" and made from animals too sick to be legally sold to humans. Some is actually made from decent ingredients. Though for cat food, the unwanted chicks from chicken hatcheries is, if handled properly, probably better and more natural for them than fish based foods, considering cats wild relatives are desert dwelling predators.

Using the bargain-brand crappy petfoods as an example to justify feeding a cat or dog vegan petfood is as unfair as someone using vegan potato chips as  an example to justify never feeding a child fruits or vegetables of any kind. Even with the proper supplements, a diet without any fruits or vegetables isn't natural for humans. (Even the Maasai people, who are famous for living mostly on milk and blood from their cows, do eat  some grains, legumes, and vegetables) And even with the proper supplements, a vegan diet is far from natural for dogs and cats, even if it is an improvement over the garbage sold under some pet food brands.

And yeah it seemed very believable that I was indeed speaking and understanding their language.  But then I woke up and could not remember what it was that we were talking about, and I had no idea why I was understanding what they had to say.  

I'm not sure our brains are capable of suddenly remembering something that takes years to learn.  Matrix style, I mean the most vivid lucid dreams that I've had I was able to grasp anything, a meaning for an instant before plummeting back to haziness.  I'm not entirely sure that you can keep doing something to the point where you are fully, I mean truly aware that you are indeed doing what you are imagining and dreaming about.  Although the act of Lucid Dreaming to me, is a big step into realizing that it does indeed exist, and I wouldn't put it past it that we can't be fully able to control everything in our dreams, Inception style.  

But it is indeed awesome to think we can potentially do something to the point where we develop the abilities that we are trying to practice in the dream.  

I've never met someone that could.  And from my experience Lucid Dreaming, I don't think anyone has been able to.  It's a very personal experience that I guess you'll have to find out, even though it's exciting to think about.  I mean others can only tell you what little big steps they have experienced, but to be honest, anything that you yourself have to say, is taken with a grain of salt.  I mean yeah they'll believe you, but they aren't the ones dreaming it."

4083		czjfsbl	AsianParentStories		"I feel for you really bad because I was in a very similar situation as you. I'm female as well in my early 20s and just graduated. My dad forced me to go into engineering and I did not have the marks for it, he stopped talking to me. He then told me to go to pharmacy or dental school I tried my best and was miserable in high school trying to get the marks but didn't. I was still forced to do something healthcare related and hated it in university. 4 years went by I had the lowest grades ever and I cried every day. I am not lying 4 yrs I was crying every day. Now I've graduated this summer, they want me to work in my career that I don't like. I'm still following them and I'm miserable but I compensated I did not want to and refused to work in the hospital. I still don't have a job though cause most of my peers got a hospital job that I did not want.

 Anyways lesson learned is: LIVE YOUR LIFE or you will be miserable. You don't have to move out if you don't have the money to do so. Your parents are going to have to deal that you don't like engineering. It will take a long time probably but they don't control your life! You need to compensate with them like I tried to do with mine (but they ended up winning in my case). I'm not saying to treat your parents like trash but take a stand for yourself you did enter engineering because of them and you tried your best in getting the degree but can't do it. We are humans. It's natural to fail and make errors. I'm still miserable despite following what my parents told me to do because it doesn't end after you get whatever degree they want you too. They want to keep controlling you for everything, what job you should apply to, where you should go, what you should dress, your hair, your boyfriend, your friends etc. 

It goes on so you (AND I) need to put our feet on the ground and stop feeling sorry for ourselves (I can't really comment any further because I feel like I'm still stuck in a situation like yours miserable about parents situation). But I hope you best of luck and know that if you ever need to talk you can always send me a message because for me it's tough not to have anyone to talk to in real life about this. "

4097		czja1wt	Fantasy		"I feel like I am writing a Match ad:here goes:
 I am looking for books with a solid moral arc, big hearts, true friendship, but also need them to be well written. It doesn't hurt to have strong female characters as well.  It appears that I like the current favorites... I have tried to find other series that capture me like these do and I just can't get invested in them the same way. 
I hope I will always love anything with elves, dwarves, druids, dragons, magic and wonder. I don't care if people consider them memes.
And please indicate if your book is vampire porn/shapeshifter porn etc. I cannot say how many times I have tried a book recommended by Goodreads (I try to find the books with a better than 4 star rating) only to find it is a Harlequin Romance with vampires. Yeesh. 

Current top series:

* **Way of Kings/Words of Radiance**: I am obsessed by these books. I have reread them at least two or three times each. I love that all of the main characters have flaws, but all strive to do the right thing. I can only say, that I feel that this is a series that may be able to compete in scope with Tolkien. I love the main characters in the book, but so many of the secondary characters are individuals I would follow in their own book (I am looking at YOU Rock and Lopen)
* **Song of Ice and Fire:** Yes, there are bad people/terrible heart breaking events, but threaded throughout are characters that I love and can root for. Also he has the ability to allow his characters to mature and change. 
* **LOTR** Opposite of SOIAF, in some ways. Simplistic view of morality (good is really good and evil is evil), but the story is so compelling,  it just doesn't matter. Most of the fellowship survived until the end, so I don't understand the requirement some readers demand that authors kill off main characters to promote a more realistic/gritty visualization. This is *fantasy* with elves and hobbits. There was enough grittiness in the story itself, without having to kill off all of the people we love.
* **Riyria Revelations**: I loved the overall bond of friendship that could not be broken between Royce and Hadrian. They were not perfect, but it was because of Hadrian's personality, drive to do things for the right reasons that he finally was able to usurp Aragorn as my favorite fantasy male.
* **Dresden Files** I love the series (and am waiting on the next installment). I have enjoyed wherever the story it takes us, but personally, I miss his basement apartment, Chicago as a character and the blue beetle. I also listen to it on audio book and feel that James Marsters IS Harry Dresden. I can only hope they try to bring back the show on HBO with James in the lead role. 
* **Hard Magic Series**: It took me a bit to get over the stereotypical dialog that Correia felt he needed to use to infer the time period but ended up really liking the characters and the alternative world he created. Didn't know or realize about the whole Sad Puppy thing until after I read the series.
* **Ready Player One**:Just a fun read. The 80's were fun.
* **Enders Game**: It took me a bit to get over the subjugation of children, but it ended wonderfully.
* **Wheel of Time series**: I started reading the series when the 6th book was coming out. I proceeded to reread every book in the series each time a new book came out. But dear god, the 8th/9th/10th books in the series almost killed off my love for characters that I had loved for YEARS. I am glad Sanderson was able to finish off the series in a fashion that was true to the overall series (I am one of those who was NOT happy with how he portrayed Mat in a kind of one key style, but he did save Perrin) but overall, impressively finished.
* **Hitchhikers Guide series**: Mindless fun, laugh out loud moments.
* **Asimov's Foundation Series** More science fiction than fantasy, but one of the first series I ever read, and he got me hooked on both science and fiction.
* **Dragon Riders of Pern**:YA, What girl doesn't want a golden dragon as your best friend?
* **Harry Potter**: YA, Great series- again, Snape's reveal in the end.
* **Artemis Fowl series**: YA series. Love the gadgetry and the humor of the series, especially the LEPrecon unit and the need to be wary of when a dwarf unhinges his jaw. 

Books I like:

* **Mistborn**: I enjoyed this Mistborn series, and am just getting to Bands of Mourning. Just never felt connected to them as much as I have to the Stormlight Archive.
* **Same for everything else written by Butcher**: I enjoyed the Codex series, and thought the getting to know and understand the perspective of the other cultures/creatures was an interesting aspect to warfare. We need to be able to take this message of understanding into the real world. I also read Aeronaut's Windlass and enjoyed it.
* **Legend of Drizzt**: I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **Iron Druid series** I enjoyed the series, just didn't love it.
* **The Shadow of What was Lost** : Enjoyed the first book, and am waiting on the second book.

Do not like: 

* **Name of the Wind** As I said before, I think Kvothe is a pompous ass.
* **Monster hunter international** Good ol' boys who hunt. Hunters glorifying guns, manliness, and..guns. And manliness.
* Tried **The Malazan Book of the Fallen**: just couldn't get into the story.
* And all my friends keep begging me to give the **Dark Tower Series** another try: I just cannot make it past the second novel.

The more dudes that decide women aren't worth the trouble is when the tide will finally shift. Similar to the ""carnivore"" women in japan now putting in effort to lure in ""herbivore"" dudes.

The gay panic defense is a legal defense, usually against charges of assault or murder. A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent temporary insanity because of a purported psychiatric condition called homosexual panic. The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.

Trans panic is a similar defense applied towards cases where the victim is a transgender or intersex person.

4151	czj3wnj	czj4ho2	AskReddit	"The close adherence to the Quran means that mainstream Muslims are not comparable to mainstream Christians in terms of the strictness of their beliefs.

It's not all of why they believe that way, but it's a large enough component to make a difference. When the book is unquestionable, the laws generated from interpreting the book tend also to be.

Neither Christians nor Muslims remove all the bad parts of their religious doctrines. Muslims tend to remove a lot less, because they started 700 years later, and (if Sunni) can't touch anything closely related to the Quran."	"No, you seriously aren't understanding what mainstream Muslims believe and I don't blame you, many people on the Internet share this naive and sophomoric view of Islamic doctrine. Most Muslims do not get their religious knowledge from the Quran, in terms of what Muslims practice, the Quran has little to do with it. The fact is that most Muslims do not read the translation of the Quran and even if they did, it's not easily understood without some hadith to support it and give it context like what conditions it must be followed in etc. This is why most Muslims rely on hadith and teachings that are passed down, hadith is much simpler to understand and that's what most Muslims follow. Most Muslims agree that the Quran itself is not enough to understand and practice Islam and even the hadith can be slightly problematic in terms of reliability and contradictions. This is why they rely on fiqh, the four schools of thought hanafi, hanbali, maliki and shafi have simplified the teachings into reliability and made rulings on what's permissable or not permissable. All sunni Muslims follow one of the four schools of thought, except the people who identify as just sunni as sunni means a follower of the sunnah and sunnah is the way of Muhammad. There are slight disagreements between the four fiqhs but generally they're close and they aren't really regarded as wrong by other schools of thought. The problem with contemporary issues is that scholars and imams make rulings based on implications e.g TV being wrong, cartoons, etc. This is one of the reasons why some Muslims say certain things are prohibited whilst doing other things. Again, what Muslims do and do not follow is heavily based on culture. A hanafi Muslim in UK who follows his religion is very different from a hanafi Muslim in Pakistan. They both follow the same school of thought but it's society and culture which influences the lifestyle. There's also not a lot to ""remove"" half the things in the Quran that seem violent go along with the context of hadith, some other things have been examined by the fiqh and contemporary scholars and by cross referencing hadith, the verses have been redefined. E.g there's an importance of God's law which must be followed, then there's hadith saying sharia law for you living in a non Muslim country is to follow the laws of the land. "

4276	dgyx7rr	dgz1aj1	Bitcoin	"Look, I'm not the world's biggest fan of anarcho-capitalism but I don't think I've ever seen ancaps advocate for this sort of loose morality where leaving a wallet with a friend somehow gives that friend licence to steal shit. How are you connecting this sociopathy to anarcho-capitalism?

If anything I'd say it's anarchists other than ""anarcho""-capitalists who would be the intellectual enablers of this sort of sociopathy. ""Property is theft"", ya know? Ancaps are pretty big on private property, unlike the others."	"Proudhon's phrase ""property is theft"" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property.

If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that *anything* was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism.

Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:

&gt; Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint.  
For the moment, he is still drinking beer,  
Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water.  
When others cry savagely ""down with the kings""  
Stirner immediately supplements ""down with the laws also.""  
Stirner full of dignity proclaims;  
You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free.  
You become accustomed to slavery  
Down with dogmatism, down with law.  
  
Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give *indirect* platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ).

I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the *least* keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - 1) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and 2) It's ability to distribute consensus has *so much more* potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth). So much so that I imagine almost any modern anarcho-*communist* society would also want base their communications upon it."

"When you see people here say ""7 chem at striker"", this is what they mean. 5 chem + loyalty bonus (10 games with club) + manager bonus (Brazilian or BBVA manager for Neymar). Players at 7 chem are still getting their stats boosted above their base stats, but not to the full boost of a 10 chem player. And if your squad still totals 100 chem, there's not a hit on subs either. So if you think Neymar's (or any other player's) card looks good, it will actually be slightly *better* in game at 7 chem."
4285	czj58l8	czj7xfi	AdviceAnimals	Methamphetamine is the most worrisome, as its chemical composition, a methylated amine, allows it to penetrate deeper into the brain causing a more potent effect on the dopaminergic system than say adderall or similar amphetamines. Extended, heavy abuse of amphetamines could lead to restructuring of how catecholamines are being neuromodulated, through inhibition of receptors from extended adrenergic agonism. Although I don't think it is likely at all that someone would die under anesthesia after having a couple adderall a day or so beforehand, it never hurts to disclose this information to your anesthesiologist. He/she really couldn't give two shits what drugs you ingest and in what frequency, they just want to keep you safe and unconscious while whatever works needs to be done is done.

You said 'we don't use wire in the field' you are wrong. Either your ignorant of the fact that FCAW is the preferred method of field welding outside of super critical stuff such as pressurised pipe or arrogantly believe that if your not welding pipe in a plant it doesn't count as welding field work (which would be hugely insulting to the iron workers, gate badgers etc) or both. You can try to wiggle out of it now and say you meant pipe welders but your original statement is wrong and you was called out on that original statement so it's your own fault for not been clear and then trying to slyly justify your original comment by overstating the extent of pipe welding in the field welding industry.

4300	cziybeh	czja61e	Jazz	It is still there. My son, up until a few months ago lived on 94th and west end. We went there all the time. 	"Yeah, great club. I walked in one blustery MLK day a few years back after leaving what I thought was a jazz concert but wasn't, in the theater on 92nd &amp; caught a great piano, bass &amp; drum trio. I was on a 1st date, there was no 2nd, so I humbly asked to sit in. The pianist graciously agreed &amp; we settled on Miles' ""Four"". 


Then the pianist picked up a trumpet &amp; the drummer counted off at an insane tempo. I get it, see if the new kid can keep up. I did, praise God, &amp; they were very cool, asked if I wanted to do another but it was time to go so I promised I'd be back. 


All in all, a fun time and world class players, to be sure. Plying my trade in Palm Beach these days. Love NYC, hate winter. There are a number of jazz venues down here but not like up north. I'm excited to see Joey DeFrancesco next month in Ft. Lauderdale. 


I recently picked up a 1946 Hammond CV &amp; am studying with Tony Monaco via Skype. Whoever tells you, piano/organ, same thing, all keys, doesn't have a clue. Playing Jimmy Smith style requires bass lines in LH leaving only 5 fingers to make the changes. As a pianist for over 1/2 century, standard MO is splitting chord tones between RH/LH, I'm going insane attempting to visualize chords voiced 100% differently.


For the most part I keep my root-7 in the LH on piano using RH for the color tones. On Hammond, I play the color tones in RH but 3-7 is missing. Inserting them in the bass line isn't the same thing. A truly humbling experience but Tony is on a 3-4 week Asian tour &amp; I'm working on ""Song For My Father"". Really digging ""Groove"" Hoimes' version, as Tony's, Joey's &amp; others. If you know of any other hip Hammond versions, turn me on to them, please. 


In any case, nice to meet you. Love to share ideas for sub changes, rearm, etc. Stay in touch. Peace."

4302	dkzjyd4	dkzo0se	FeMRADebates	">(because gender is not the same thing as gender roles—a tomboy or masculine woman is still a woman)

I've had a similar thought, like if genders are a representation of one's place on a spectrum between male and female, shouldn't ""Bro"" or ""Tomboy"" be genders?

I personally would like to distance myself from ""Men"", perhaps as a ""Gentleman""?"	"&gt;In its original meaning, the term denoted a man of the lowest rank of the English gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers and the younger sons of baronets, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession, and thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. In this sense, the word equates with the French gentilhomme (""nobleman""), which latter term has been, in Great Britain, long confined to the peerage. Maurice Keen points to the category of ""gentlemen"" in this context as thus constituting ""the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France"".

In no way is the offense amazing, but again bottom 5 is just a ludicrous statement and you obviously don't have any actual information supporting your statement considering how far off base they are. I'd suggest reading up. This is a division opponent and one of the biggest rivalries in football. There is no excuse for you to be so poorly informed on this team."	I'm not poorly informed at all.

I thought the concert was canceled as well, then around 1pm I realized nobody has emailed me about the cancelation and started freaking out. My only transportation there is a train ride that goes for 1hr and 20min, and the VIP ticket holders have to be there by 4 or we'll miss the whole program set for us. I got there around 5:30, I was crying in the train on the way there too. I went in and told them I'm a VIP and the lady named Victoria was the one who gave me my ticket and merch. She told me to wait for a few minutes and she'll be back. She came back and told me to follow her, she asked why I was late and I told her everything. She also told me how Alessia's been feeling and that they didn't do the soundcheck to preserve her voice for the show tonight. She then followed up with ""so, how about a private, one-on-one meet and greet with her?"" in my head I started freaking out and she took me to her dressing room. It was the craziest thing ever. When she came up the first words that came out of my mouth were ""are you okay? How are you?"" all she can do was mouth the words ""yeah, I'm doing okay. Hopefully I can sing tonight"". I gave her my gift, took pics with her and have her signed some stuff. She's the sweetest and most down to earth famous person I've ever met.

The main difference is economy of scale. There are many dishes that I would use 3 separate pans for in a kitchen but only 1 for at home to save time on cleanup and be able to multi task easier. The same with industrial ovens, dozens of knives (although you still use a chef's knife for 95% of things), etc.

Plating and decoration make food look better even when it's not, I usually skip that at home but the food's the same quality.

Ingredient selection is definitely hampered at home, without wholesale prices and the guarantee that I'll use expensive things before they expire, but that's something that can be partially avoided with planning, or just tolerated if I really want to make a knockout dish.

So what CAN I make better than a restaurant? Most everything. What DO I make better, on a day to day basis? Not many things."

4362	dgyyylf	dgyzij8	CalamariRaceTeam	Go buy it in person instead of online. Trying it on will make a huge difference. Everytime I've gone to the store to buy something I saw online it doesn't fit and I buy something that works better. This is especially true for helmets and gloves. Shoei and Icon helmets have really different fits, so I doubt you'd be happy with either or. At best one might fit, but it's quite possible neither would.	The Shoei fit really well, thankfully, and I haven't found a small Airmada to try on but from what you're saying they're different head shapes.. Problem for all of the above is trying to find a store that has anything I might be interested in. The few shops I've been to just have black leather on black leather with a side of fringed black leather haha. But yeah, I hear you with trying things on!

4366	czjga7f	czjgle2	MarioMaker	This is easily one of the most elaborate levels I have ever played. I loved the progression, the power-ups, and even the queued music/sound effects. I can't believe how long the level is! I unfortunately couldn't beat it tonight, but I'd love to try again... its just so long! I loved it though. Beautifully designed and great aesthetic.	Very very much appreciated!  I hope Nintendo will allow you to disable the timer in a future patch but am not holding my breath on that.

4388	dkzwfwf	dkzx0xz	AskTrumpSupporters	"He already campaigned on his healthcare reform, the healthcare reform being worked on, though, is the one congress is proposing because they have their own ideas... that they haven't set up until Trump won and went ""oh wait, oh shit"".

The false equivalency comes from, if you read my comments, acting like the GOP and Dems in the legislation operate the same way. Yes, the dems can get a slight majority and and carry themselves through because they are provably of one organizational mind, as proven by the DNC emails leaked, whereas, as you would've seen if you read my comment, the RNC has Heritage Foundation types and then the Rand Paul libertarian types, and soon will have full on Trump types if the midterms go as expected. It's a divided party that can't agree with itself. While I would say having more than one thought process is a good thing in politics, to say ""Oh, they're all good because pure numbers"" is wrong.

TL;DR: Read, don't skim"	"You should never assume that the person you having a discussion with is dumber than you are. I read your comment but I think you're misusing the term false equivalency.

To reiterate, I think one-mindedness comes from being in power for a long time. I believe the as more time passes the Republicans will eventually conform around specific goals and work rather cohesively. That may be around the WH or it may not. It kind of depends on what their constituents want.

I know that the RNC has many fractions. What I'm saying very bluntly is that if they can't figure out those fractions is screwed because then they'll accomplish nothing and lose power.

The reason why comparing the RNC to the DNC isn't false equivalency, in summary, is because they were ""hired"" to a do the same job; run the country.

The the RNC can't figure out a way to do that effectively then they're not doing their jobs and people who vote R will become and should become pissed off.

As for Trump, he needs to keep campaigning on it. He should keep on message and repeating that message until the job gets done. 

Without that focus and effort the RNC gets to fight among itself and get nothing done.

Just imagine that Trump laid down a clear idea of what Trumpcare was, what you would get and why it was better. Not just Obamacare sucks but ""this is my plan. This is why it's better.""

Trump won the election. If he could get enough of the R electorate on his side the Senate/House would be forced to follow.

Wouldn't that be better?"
4389		czj70z1	SandersForPresident		"He's got a point that I think most people forget about. I watched one of the republican debates where all of them (mostly Rubio) talked about how they would restore the mighty american military, yet those same people ask how Bernie would pay for everything.. 

Maybe if we don't spend as much as the next 8 nations combined on our military (and that's the weak military that Rubio wants to strengthen), we would have money to help people not go bankrupt for having cancer."
4390	czj6qpy	czje58x	AskReddit	"But it is bad science. What's the point of chaning a category that you already use. The definition of solar system planets it's meaningless, it's too arbitrary. 

Moons may as well be planets, there is no point in making this more complex with no practical effects."	"False. There is a very good reason for it's reclassification.

Pluto is just one of many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).

When Pluto was discovered and classified as a planet, we didn't know that these other very similar and very close together bodies existed.

If we classify Pluto as a planet, then we have to classify many (or all) of the other KBOs as planets to avoid arbitrarily picking just one or two of them and calling them planets.

And since we're letting the Kuiper Belt Objects in on the planetary action, we'd be forced to look at the Asteroid Belt again. The same process that happened with Pluto and the other KBOs *already happened* with Ceres and the other Asteroids in the 19th century. The first few Asteroids were considered planets until we realized there's tons of them, and they all far more resemble each other than they do planets. 

If we count all of them then we're left with a mess of hundreds or thousands of planets. So instead of that, the IAU decided to follow prior precedent, and Pluto and the other KBOs went the way of the Asteroids. Unlike the KBOs and Asteroids, the 8 planets are all *unique.*"
4391	czje658	czje8l1	ALTP	I feel those who are active players should have like a quick draft for the continuing captains. It is not their fault that their team has been lacking consistent attendance. I understand why the teams are being disbanded but for those who came out ever week they suddenly do not have a team. Overall I think it is a good idea, but again those who played for those two teams and showed up to every game are now without a team, and possibly for a while. 	They'll be on teams by this Wednesday - they just have to sign up for free agency.

4397	dgyt347	dgytt8f	Negareddit	Let's be clear, the debate IS settled. But even when the science is in, there are always some holdouts.	"Well yes, obviously I agree. I'm not sitting here like ""Hmm, maybe the fascists have a point"". I guess it's just...if you'd told me ten years ago that people in *mainstream politics* would be suggesting it might be a good idea to put members of a specific religion on a registry, and holocaust denial would be anything other than a fringe loony thing, and it would be acceptable to assert that black people were inherently less intelligent than white people, I would have laughed in your face.

I'm always making funny comments. About anything, right? But I learned not to do it so much here when the subject is anybody on the left. People here can make all the jokes they want to about Trump or Limbaugh or Bannon and it's fine. (And hey- funny is funny, right? If I can say something witty about one of them, then I'll do it too. But I'll do it to the left just as equally.) But God forbid you make a Hillary or Bernie joke. I got something like -78 one day because I make a crack about Bernie Sander's hair or something! Not his politics or his stance on this issue or that issue. No, his crazy hair.

Yes, I actually was planning on eventually having the crew of this sub successfully destroy a Syndicalist submarine while submerged (a feat that which has only been accomplished once in our history's 1944). I want to add in a lot of political references (based on the timeline) and hint at some maybe not-so-lore friendly events and on-goings. I want there to be a lot of intrigue, rivalries, and tension plaguing this crew alongside the large possibility of death and failure every single day as the crew fights the Red Tide a quarter of a mile deep below the sea.

4. ***Insight!:***
 * Edea is 150% weak to lightning in the first phase, so you can skip the two Dispels by just nuking her with the strongest lightning attack in the game - a fully powered Raijin Detonate + RW Cloud USB
 * The rest of the team was just for support - Rikku periodically refreshed Haste, and I popped Shout, Chant, Armor Break and Mug Bloodlust before unleashing Raijin Detonate
 * I Entrusted Raijin a bar with Ramza, but it wasn't really necessary because Edea spams a lot of AoE and Raijin probably won't have problems getting a second SB bar - just LS up to 1.5 bars before powering up Raijin
 * Raijin does BSB entry - Cmd1 x 4 - BSB entry - Cmd1 x 2 - RW Cloud USB - Detonate
 * The damage was a bit overkill (to say the least) - Edea took 60k x 10 from the fully powered Raijin Detonate taking away the last 80% of her health. 
 * Lightning resist would have been helpful as I've only seen Edea using Lightning attacks in the first phase. I had no trouble keeping up with healing anyway with Wall up

The really frustrating part is, occasionally, two hours later he comes in, gets his shoes on, and says ""I thought we were going?"" Apparently he decided yes sometime in there but didn't actually tell anyone. And everyone has not gotten ready or made other plans and then he's mad.

That's an overkill. You don't have to do that. As long as you still got your shit together and are midly interesting, you can still get that ""dream woman"". 

Just remember though that you're chasing after something that is the absolute best fit for you. It isn't impossible, but you're shrinking your dating pool.

&gt;Everyone around my says I'm not that old yet and how I have plenty of time. but you fucking know what? The ones that all say that met their partners when they were low to mid 20's. Not one of those fuckers met them after 30. Not fucking one yet they all tell my I'm not too old. 

Come on they're trying to make you feel better and you're being an ass about it. They can't tell you about dating after the age of 30 so they tell you what they know. Again, you're not too old

My advice to gamers who want an SP4 is to find different kinds of games for it than you would expect to play on your gaming rig. Looking at my steam library I can see at least 20 great games that would run perfectly on any model SP4 and that's just what I've got installed.

It correctly displays my 1100+ unranked mmr and champ 3+ ranks in every playlist which corresponds with my [rocketleaguetracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/amustycow) ranks. Make sure you look at the last part of my steam ID on rocketleagueracker. It's the same name as my reddit account. Next, I shift+tab to pull up the steam menu which shows my recent games. You may need to pause here. It shows that I played someone named ""Maze"" 1 day ago which corresponds with the name of my opponent in the post. You can also see that I have 43 friends online. I don't know many people that have 43 friends on a smurf, let alone all of them being online. The next scene shows that I have 581 hours on record. (I moved from xbox 3 months ago and had around 1700 hours on xbox.) Also, it shows i have 91 hours in the past 2 weeks. That's over 6 hours a day. I don't know many people that have that amount of playtime on a smurf. Also in this scene you can see the end of my steam profile which corresponds with both my reddit username and my [rocketleaguetracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/amustycow) url

That said, Hanks did an excellent job. You're not basing your judgement of his acting ability on acting-related evidence. Not to mention, actors act the way the way they're told to.

4591	dkyp1gx	dkzylzp	DebateReligion	">Well, why not? Do you believe that they failed the sudoku? Do you think they've misremembered where they put the 9? If you don't have a justified reason for disregarding their statement, then you really should consider what they have to say, even if you ultimately still decide to not go with what they said.

Unless their anecdote included how they came to there conclusion, then there is nothing for me to consider, there is nothing to analyze. If they are right, there should be a way for me to come to the same conclusion on my own. If they are wrong and I trust that information, I may have to restart the entire Sudoku, as I likely would not likely remember every superjacent choice I made based on that wrong information. 

If you are going to be making a choice of any importance, you need to be able to verify the information you are given. I would only act on unverified information as an act of desperation, if forced to make a choice with no other information to act on.

An anecdote could be a lie, or simple misremembering. While there may be no reason to assume an anecdote is false, there is also no reason to assume an anecdote is true. 

Any confirmable data, no matter how minor, is better to go on that any amount of anecdotes, no matter how great."	"Sorry for the wordiness. I do tend to get wordy.

&gt; Unless their anecdote included how they came to there conclusion, then there is nothing for me to consider, there is nothing to analyze. If they are right, there should be a way for me to come to the same conclusion on my own. If they are wrong and I trust that information, I may have to restart the entire Sudoku, as I likely would not likely remember every superjacent choice I made based on that wrong information. 

Well, actually, their anecdote does contain something for you to consider: they claim they did/finished the sudoku, right? That means that if their answer was correct, they should have gotten no inconsistencies, leading you to believe that their placement of the 9 was possibly/probably correct. Unless you interpret their statement of ""I did the sudoku earlier"" to *not* include ""I finished the sudoku earlier, with no inconsistencies"".

On the other hand, if I listened to your friend (somewhere along the way, I decided he's your friend eventhough, looking back, you never specified that. but it's easier to reference this way, so I will continue with it) and put a 9 there, would I necessarily be a fool at that point? Remember that we live within a timeline that we have no control over; I *can't* know whether the 9 truly goes there or not until after I've finished the puzzle. After the puzzle is complete, I'll be able to know the truth, *whether I trusted your friend or not* (because this is incorporates an exhaustive example, unlike with the bathroom thing where failing to see the bathroom could prompt the people to keep saying ""it's further back"" or ""you just missed it"" or something else), but at the very point where I listen to your friend and put the 9 in the box while you don't listen to your friend and refuse to put the 9 in the box, neither you nor I can possibly know whether it is correct or not. But the point of listening isn't to know whether he is correct or not; it's to decide whether it's a potentially good idea to act on the information or not.

(realistically, I like solving sudoku on my own, so I would actually get annoyed if someone told me ""put a 9 there"" and I probably wouldn't be one to listen. Not because I distrust them, but because ""it's *my* game that I'm playing"")

And if you set the standard super high to the point where you don't trust anyone else, does that still mean nobody else is allowed to trust anyone else? What about teachers? If I take a math class and my teacher tells me that 2+2=4, am I allowed to trust the teacher prior to ""solving the proof"" for myself? (solving the proof being different from just getting the answer, as mathematically solving the proof means working out all of the underlying mechanics of *how/why* 2 plus 2 equals 4, which is actually a bit more difficult than intuitively putting two objects with two other objects and claiming its now a group of four objects. http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/as2446/224.pdf as an example of exactly that proof. That kind of proving isn't taught in grade 1 where we learn 2+2=4, so we necessarily trust the teacher when they teach us a system that we haven't verified for ourselves yet. As a further aside, this pure mathematical proving falls under Rationalism, knowledge gained purely from thought alone, rather than Empiricism, knowledge gained through sensory observation. Knowledge gained through Rationalism is actually considered stronger in terms of ""truthiness"" compared to Empiricism, but only so long as it rests on Deductive Reasoning as only Deductive Reasoning can provide true conclusions so long as the premises are true. Inductive Reasoning and Abductive Reasoning cannot give true conclusions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wrCpLJ1XAw&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR&amp;index=3 for that reference)

&gt; If you are going to be making a choice of any importance, you need to be able to verify the information you are given. I would only act on unverified information as an act of desperation, if forced to make a choice with no other information to act on.

I don't think that's the case at all. Going back to the washroom example, if a bunch of people all told you ""we saw a washroom around the corner"", then ""you going to see for yourself whether there is a washroom there"" is itself the ""acting on unverified information"" as you act *to* verify it.

In the sudoku example, you continuing on with the sudoku is a form of verification because eventually you will learn for yourself whether the 9 goes there or not, but you set it up so that your verification there is simply from ignoring what your friend had to say and working it out for yourself. I, on the other hand, listened to what your friend had to say and worked it out from there; if your friend is right then I will have no inconsistencies, whereas if your friend is wrong then I will have an inconsistency prior to finishing the puzzle (unless I make a mistake. But then, even though you didn't listen to your friend, you could still make a mistake too, so that's a negligible thing).

&gt; An anecdote could be a lie, or simple misremembering. While there may be no reason to assume an anecdote is false, there is also no reason to assume an anecdote is true. 

And you don't have to assume the anecdote is true. The anecdote is simply someone's claim about something they observed. It's a *reason* to believe that they *could* be right, not that they *necessarily are* right.

&gt; Any confirmable data, no matter how minor, is better to go on that any amount of anecdotes, no matter how great.

The anecdotes lead you in the direction of verification. The anecdotes themselves are not the verification. Just like any other evidence; evidence points towards the truth of the larger picture but it not *itself* the truth of the larger picture.

Say you walk around a building and see two cars in the street at odd angles, one of the doors smashed in on one car, and the front bender smashed in on the other car: these are all observations of pieces of data that you could try to piece together yourself, but those pieces themselves are not the full story of the truth of what happened and you use a lot of guesswork as glue to put them together. If someone else comes along and claims ""I saw the car crash. That car there hit that car there"" then their story is not the full story of the truth of what happened either. Each piece is a truth *in its own right*, but in regards to the larger story, each piece is just part of a larger puzzle that we try to piece together. Anecdotes, which is to say other peoples' claims of their observations, are just like your own personal observations in that they are just pieces of the puzzle.

And in the car crash, the only way to *certainly* know what happened, would be to watch it yourself; anything less, including watching a video of the crash right after the video was taken, is merely trusting another source; and thus we get into primary sources versus secondary sources (maybe I should have gone this route earlier). You are a primary source of anything you directly observe or think or feel. [EDIT]But everyone else is a also primary source of their own thoughts and feelings and observations of events[/EDIT]. Sure it's better to get as close to a primary source as possible to the point where ""you being a primary source"" is the best possible scenario, but sometimes we just plain can't get close to a primary or even secondary source, such as in the case of history from thousands of years ago.

EDIT: Physical recordings are also considered primary sources so long as they either directly record the event, in the case of video, or are created by people who are primary sources, ie an eye-witness account.

EDIT 2: for more on primary and secondary sources https://library.ithaca.edu/sp/subjects/primary and http://www.uvic.ca/library/research/tips/primvsec/index.php

EDIT 3: Or maybe I should take the angle of reversing the roles of a scenario. Someone comes up to you and asks where the bathroom is, and since you just used the bathroom, you can tell them ""it's right around the corner"". Or, you just finished a sudoku and your friend is having a hard time of the exact same one (what are the odds!) so you decide to help him out by giving him a hint: ""9 goes in that square""."

Clearly Ozpin was preparing to do something with his cane--which he wielded like a sword rather than a staff/baton--before the school shook.  What was it?  Activating some sort of power?  Activating a mechanism?  Argh, I hate teasing!

Also, in the end shot when Cinder was on the roof watching--I think she now knows, after seeing Pyrrha move towards Ozpin, that Pyrrha is the chosen candidate.  She already knew that Ozpin held the keys to the Fall Maiden, and his appearance confirms that Pyrrha is the new target (both for the powers and for Cinder).   However, that said, we don't know that Cinder has another glove, so she can't take the powers that way--she'd have to kill Pyrrha, and she'd have to force herself into Pyrrha's last thoughts (unlikely, given Jaune's presence).  No, I think they fight, and they fight to a draw--leaving Cinder to return another day next volume.

Well done episode.  However, Ironwood's survival is doubtful unless he has metal plates in the back of his head (or if those Atlasian soldiers also have terrible aim at point-blank range); otherwise, they should reasonably have executed him.

So Merc and Emerald will be sent into the school, Cinder will attempt to hack her way into the elevator and interrupt the transfer (which she fails at, because otherwise the plot goes haywire)--Ozpin drives her off but injures/exhausts himself in the process, Jaune defends Pyrrha, Yang finds Merc and battles him while Emerald has a crisis of conscience, Weiss protects Blake with her new summon when Blake fails against Adam, and hopefully Ruby can hand it to Neo (though I have my doubts since Yang is the better hand-to-hand fighter and still lost) before addressing Torchwick.  Glynda and Qrow take out the Wyvern, Port and Oobleck can handle the gryffins.  I know all of this won't be wrapped up neatly before the end of this volume--all the Bad Guys can't be defeated, else we wouldn't have continuation of the series--but some of those fights, I hope, end up in the Good Guys' favor."	You just made me think about Pyrrha dying and giving powers to Jaune. That would absolutely destroy me.

That's just silly? Why would you play the game your opponent wants? Don't get me wrong, Woodley soundly defeated Maia and prevented him from executing his gameplan. But Woodley didn't do anything outside of that, his gameplan was negate Maia instead of negate Maia and execute his own gameplan. He won but he didn't impress.

I was also very unimpressed with Maia as well, he failed to adapt his gameplan at all when it clearly wasn't working."	Maia had a pretty boring title fight with Anderson Silva that went pretty much the same way. Its not all Woodley's fault.

the rest literally went to school then took the train home and sat in their really small dorms, daring to go karaoke singing once in a blue moon. i think the most they did was go to the arcades for a half hour before going home. 

it was heartbreaking to watch. they were all obsessed with anime and all that bullshit culture and they were too pussy to even see the city theyve probably had on their minds for years. others were so scared of the train station that instead of going from shinjuku station to harajuku station (a 15-20 minute train ride on ONE LINE THAT GOES IN A SQUARE AND COMES BACK) they decided to go the way they knew even after me explaining how ridiculously easy it is, which took them 2.5 hours. 

it was truly sad. none of them really explored any of it. they experienced a mere fraction of what tokyo was capable of giving them. especially them.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

I'm sure I could rift farm for my 70 clear as I cleared 69 in six minutes but I'm struggling to survive certain elite packs because I don't get the added toughness of the endless walk set.

My Rathma can definitely do it but man it would be way less try hard. Don't even get me started on the shear amount of shards I've gambled on pants and yet no ancient pants for me.

"Don't get me wrong, I did 70 with terrible Rathma (zero ancients), and I used the blood-sucking Simul necklace to do it (I got my hellfire later).

I struggle to survive certain elites on 60+ with my Rathma gear and I'm 9/14 ancient (and 1/9, the weapon, is primal!).  It's down to how much damage they do, how they do it, and so on.  It's more about placement and tactics at this level.

The Pledge set will help you deal damage and survive a bit, but it isn't the be all and end all.  Granted, I come from playing insanely fragile wizards, and insanely fragile Crusader LoN builds, so maybe it just bothers me less.

4728	dkzhbrb	dkzte6o	RadicalChristianity	"> We are using liberal in the sense of liberal democracy, economic liberalism, etc.

Oh, I am very aware of the long and complicated of what is ""liberal"".  So, given that this  history is long and complicated and that the word ""liberal"" we should be very careful about how we use it.  We need to respect that this word is used by people to self-identify.  People say ""I am a liberal"", or ""I voted Liberal, go Justin Trudeau!"" or ""I am a liberal theologian"" or even ""my Christianity is a liberal Christianity"".  So, when u/Demon_Nietzsche says he is ready to delete ""liberal garbage"", it becomes an attack on all who have ""liberal"" as part of their self-identity.  Would we allow a moderator to post, ""I am going to delete all feminist garbage"" from the subreddit?  No, we would rightly see this as a sexist attack against women."

4732	dgvwfww	dgyu3na	KansasCityBeer	"Glad you dig Magic Magic! This is Rafi, Torn Label Brewing co-owner. There's a couple different factors that OP and other commenters have alluded to which contribute to the reasons we're not able to brew that beer year-round:

- Ingredient pricing: Magic Magic is one of if not our most expensive beers to brew. The hops (primarily Mosaic) as well as the raspberry and lemon peel are all culprits here. An in-demand hop like Mosaic can easily sell for 4-5x the price per pound as an (equally as tasty IMO but less sexy) hop like Columbus (which we use in an everyday beer like Alpha Pale). And that's if you can find it, which leads me to . . . 

- Ingredient availability: Many hops, such as Mosaic, Citra or Galaxy, we use in our once-a-year offerings but not regularly because they're near-impossible to obtain on contract as a new brewery but if you're vigilant and patient, you can at some point in the year find them on the spot market. Now that we've been around a couple years, we're fortunate enough to have a few of them on contract, but typically we can only contract for small-ish amounts of those varieties due to availability and the aforementioned price point issue.

- ""Keeping it limited to drive hype"" is not a factor in our decision making process but concerns about its increased availability ARE, if that makes sense. As amazing as the response to Magic Magic in limited distribution has been, that's not necessarily a guarantee of high demand once a product hits another echelon of production, and if that doesn't end up being the case it would be a costly mistake for us to make, to say the least. Beyond the costs related to hops and adjuncts that I mentioned, there is also the issue that because Magic is a once-a-year release we utilized shrink sleeve cans rather than painted cans (as we use on year-round beers Alpha Pale, House Brew and Monk & Honey), which allows us to bring in lower minimums. If we made Magic Magic a year-round beer we would have to switch to painted cans, which requires us to pre-order nearly a year's supply of cans, so making that switch is not something we can take lightly.

- In my view, NE style IPAs tend to have a shorter shelf life than West Coast IPAs and you see aroma and flavor degradation swiftly. Even with Magic being an extremely sought-after, it's inevitable that we do see sporadic cans or even a stray 1/6 bbl that sticks around longer than is healthy for that beer, and making that product more consistently would inescapably exacerbate that problem. We are inordinately concerned with freshness, and generally speaking we would rather make less of a product and have it run out quickly than make a bit more than we needed to and as a result have it suffer in quality if it doesn't sell through as quick as we'd like.

- This is a bit sillier and less rooted in practicalities, but part of what makes a lot of once-a-year/occasional releases enjoyable is the ephemeral nature of the beer: it feels fun and special right now when Magic time rolls around, and as much as myself and others would dig drinking it all year round, it would inevitably feel less special that way.

Hope all that makes sense and answers your question! Even though Magic Magic won't return until next spring, we do have two new NE IPAs that will see limited distribution in cans later in 2017."	God damn. That's the best response ever. Thanks for that, and for making good quality, honest beer.

4754	dkzkg16	dkztj8y	CasualConversation	What's the difference in this case?	"Socialism is a *very* broad idea about social ownership with many different ways for that to be implemented. The nature of which is very compatible with democracies and capitalism. Hence why pretty much every industrialized nation has many elements of socialism. The US is frequently criticized for having fewer social programs than the other OECD nations, particularly for its general lack of a socialized healthcare system (except medicaid, medicare, and the veteran programs).

Communism is more specific and while it has multiple definition itself, it usually involves seizing (not ceasing, haha) the means of production (and ""the means of production"" also varies by definition). Communism tries to outright remove social classes and typically requires a great upheaval of society (although communist thinkers are somewhat divided on whether or not outright revolution is necessary for the transformation into a communist society). And while we're breaking misconceptions, communism doesn't require that every is paid the same or the likes.

In practice, communism has tended to result in dictators. Probably in part because of the common idea that a powerful, small, transitional government would be needed to facilitate the massive upheaval, and that tends to favor someone rising as a dictator. Not to mention the fact that communism appeals to the working class, making it a rallying cry. Socialism, on the other hand, in practice tends to be used mostly by democracies and is a principle tool of modern liberalism, which heavily favours welfare systems, which are a socialistic idea. Perhaps a common area for confusion is how many communist governments have put ""socialist"" somewhere in their name. But they also like to call themselves ""democratic"" and ""republic"", so you really shouldn't put much weight in names!"

In A New Hope, Luke's shot misses and the Death Star isn't destroyed, leading to Leia getting taken and trained by Vader and Palpatine. ESB has Luke dying that night on Hoth, so Leia goes to Dagobah to be trained by Yoda. Jedi has the negotiations with Leia (as Boushh) with Jabba go sideways, and a shootout happens, changing the chain of events. I'd recommend them, they are lots of fun."

Clan | Leader | Required trophies to join 
:-- | :-- | :-- 
worstname4aclan | W-Quan | 3000
UsoName4aClan | KeyboardWarrior | 0

**Now, what does our main clan provide for you if you join?** 

- Full chests.
- A private tournament at the end of every month(one hosted 3 days ago). Both clans can participate!
- Friendly battles & Clan battles galore. 
- 33k clan trophies with 48 members. Over 30 players has/had been into hog mountain and many are pushing! 
- 16k season donations, so you'll always get what you want.
- Kik Clan chat and Discord Server is made! Kik: #clashroyalerecruitment | Discord Server is recently made so pm me for more details. 
- Diverse age group. Mostly high school teenagers to adults. Occasionally higher or lower. This means there are minimum restrictions on what you can say!
- A feeder clan if you ever make a second account or want your annoying ass little brother who's in barbarian bowl to stay somewhere that's active. 

Yes, like I mentioned above, we have a feeder clan! One of our mates who got to 4k trophies is helping our clan out, and we already got 21 members.

""Siri, what is 7 x 6?"" ""Siri, who should I vote for?""

I'm just as guilty of this to some degree, when someone asks me how to do something, I don't say, ""Think about it."" I say, ""Use your googles, you moron."""	"If we go with that idea, I'd say it is more like kids have been given access to an endless fount of information, but have NOT been taught the tools necessary to determine that which is relevant and accurate and how to apply that information to achieve their goals.

So they get distracted by Netflix and Marvel Movies and all other sorts of low-impact information. It's a *Brave New World* sort of argument, I guess. There's too much information out there for any one person to sift through, so they just don't bother. As you say, if they ever need it, they just ask Siri, why bother paying attention? 

OR they do, but they focus on simple, high-emotion stories and ignore the complex underlying mechanisms and laws at work. They don't need to know about that, they just need to get outraged and demand that something be done. In lieu of building a better world (which takes effort and a solid understanding of reality) they complain about the world they got and hope somebody else fixes it.

Take, for instance, this whole hullabaloo around the Fine Brothers, rather than targeting the underlying IP system that enables them to even do what they're doing.

The nice thing is that the internet has the ability to teach you good information AND the tools to make use of such information for your own advancement. I try to make this sub such a place. But you have to have some level of underlying intelligence to bootstrap into rational thinking. 

If you never learned logic, critical thinking, and the biases you are saddled with, you won't even know that you're being distracted and mislead, it just won't occur to you."

Then, you run it into the uplink port on a normal WiFi router to serve your computers, phones, etc. If you're getting 300 m range there's probably a rooftop outdoor antenna serving that part of campus, so you could point a dish at that. The Ubiquiti devices have a built-in strength monitor that you can see on your laptop while you assist them.

However, that model would only work if they have 5 GHz support at your campus, and it might be wishful thinking to get a5 GHz signal from a sector antenna from that far away. There are also 2.4 GHz options, which would be somewhat bigger and probably more expensive.

Storage Pool

A storage pool can consist of heterogeneous physical disks. Notice that a physical drive in the context of Windows Server 2012 Storage Space is simply raw storage from a variety of types of drives including USB, SATA, and SAS drives as well as an attached VHD/VHDX file as shown below. With a storage pool, Windows Server 2012 presents the included physical drives as one logical entity. The allocating the capacity of a storage pool is to first create a virtual disk based on the storage pool followed by creating and mapping a volume Later a drive letter or an empty folder. And with the mapping, the volume based on a virtual disk of a storage pool will appear and work just like a conventional hard drive or folder in Windows Explorer.

seems like with 'simple' you still get raid 0 like performance, which if a single disk dies I'm screwed."

You cannot tell by looking at your ejaculate if it contains sperm or not. Sperm are too small to see with the naked eye.

4997	czgtqcs	czjdqfx	DaystromInstitute	People are not answering the question I posed. I will clarify. When Sisko retook DS9, Dukat was in Federation custody now had the war ended at that point or shortly there after would the other parties convene a trial for Dukat using him as a bargaining chip to force the Dominion to surrender.  Sisko, Martok and Senator Velal could force concessions onto the Dominion by holding a public trial of Cardassia's former leader. My question is not about the outcome of the war rather it is about the methods open to the Alliance in prosecuting the war.      	"I do think so. The Dominion pretended like the Cardassians were ""important partners"", but the Dominion ran the whole show. They demonstrated that they didn't give a sh#t about the Cardassians time and time again.

By the end of the war the Dominion was so annoyed with the Cardassians that they ordered their wholesale extermination. They certainly didn't care about Dukat. In fact, the Cardassians didn't seem to care either, and there was a seamless transition from Dukat to Damar.

The other Allies would almost certainly call for the execution of Dukat, while the Federation would call for some sort of prison / rehabilitation sentence. Since the Federation caught him, I guess it would be their call, but to keep the Romulans and Klingons appeased, they may have been willing to turn him over to some sort of equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials (where capital punishment remained on the table). In normal times I think they'd insist on prison, but they couldn't afford to piss off the Allies."

5005	czjfzqy	czjg8r4	DenverBroncos	"Well that's my point. Nothing is free, but that's how it is percieved. If people would do a little research they would see that the upper end is paying a large portion (43.4% tax basis with Obamacare tax included if I remember correctly, it's late and I'll have to double check now) on top of that only the upper 2 divisions of the tax bracket are paying the Obamacare tax. That's ridiculous. Think about how skewed that is. 

Then you have Sanders saying he wants to give everyone a free college education. No. No no no no NO. It doesn't work that way. By going to college you are making a choice that you want to have an advantage over others your same age in the job force. You think you should get that without paying? Bullshit. Don't tell me you can't go to school and work either. I know plenty that do, maybe you can't go to a major school, but you can start at a community college and work your way up as your resources accumulate if you work at it. That one really pisses me off.

And yes weed is a vice. I don't mind people smoking, and I think it has a ton of medicinal value, but it creates massive issues for employers, especially those with vehicles on the road, or in dangerous situations. The set up for it was poorly executed and years later they still don't know how to handle it. On top of that Colorado is the number 1 exporter of illegal pot to other states now in the nation... that's a great rap to have. The tax is a joke.

Trump... he says some thing that I think are interpreted in a way he doesn't intend ag times due to not being a politician, and going mostly off the top of his head. I still worry he could just be a ploy at this point. Also, if he were elected he would need one hell of a VP, one that could pull him back at times. But if he is speaking the truth, yes, he wants to tear a lot of the bureaucracy out of the system. Also, the United States is simply the largest business in the world, he runs an extremely successful business by surrounding himself with people that know their jobs and he trusts, and listens to them. He doesn't have to know every facet of his business, he just has to get the right people for the job, which is what the president has to do with his cabinet.

So I can make a decent argument for him, but I still don't trust him completely at this time, and I want to see more debates that aren't just staged to attack each other. As an aside, people rip on him about his comment of a ""small million dollar loan"", well the fact of the matter is that ***IS*** small for a business to get any type of start, and to grow at any type of speed. Just think of manufacturing, that's nothing. He also turned a million into a billion... that's the equivalence of you or I turning a hundred dollar bill into 100,000 dollars... 1000x growth. That's one statement that shouldn't be ragged on. But he does say some stupid shit... 

So yea... that was longer than intended, but I felt you deserved a full answer, since you actually seemed interested in thoughtful discussion. "	"Glad to see that opinion.  

I mostly agree.  

Also, obviously, Trump IS a bit over the top in his actions, but what better choice is there?  

Hilary, with her lies and political dicksuckery?  

Jeb, with his turtles and guac?  

Bernie, with his unrealistic pipe dream liberal-land promises?  

Who else is a realistic candicate?  

This is why I say that Trump seems to be the top candidate.  

I like how you said that 'people couldn't handle weed'.  I agree wholeheartedly.  The government has a responsability to sway people to do certain things, as to not harm themselves or everyone else, or cause harm by inaction.  

I feel like a president is someone that knows many people, knows how the world works, and knows what is best for the people, kind of like a good, stern parent.  

Hilary seems to be an absentminded soccer mom sipping on her frappe, Jeb seems like an autistic kid obcessed with turtles and guac, and Bernie seems to be a pothead that thinks 'love is all you need man', thinking that people have the ability to have self-control and provide their justified part in the system as a whole.  

Trump knows what's best for the nation, at least on the economics side of it, which is likely the single largest point of focus for the US, moving through the years when the EU dissolves, China falls, and mass refugee problems are abundant.  

I enjoyed your opinions, and will upvote you due to your honest, and thoughtful POV without namecalling and booing.

I have been fortunate though to play in a very good off-season comp. All teams consist of players in the highest tier of grades so the games are just as hard, if not harder, than winter season.

The other benefit of playing off-season is it helps to maintain game fitness.  May not be the same as your off-season comp but I would recommend giving it a shot!

As for stick skills, I know plenty of players who will focus on tapping the ball at the end of their stick and practice dribbling skills in the backyard. Hard to do much if you don't have much room but these basics will help with hand-eye coordination and to speed up basic skills."

However, they have enough where they can say, passionately pursue desires- like Papyrus wanting to join the Royal Guard. For JUSTICE, BRAVERY, PERSEVERANCE, KINDESS, INTEGRITY, and PATIENCE, I feel like they're more like traits than substances, or else Alphys probably would have managed to get those from the souls as well while she was experimenting. With these traits, probably nothing physical would happen to a monster with excessive amounts. They'd simply become extreme representations of those traits.

5078		dkzslau	BleachBraveSouls		"Have my upvote- I agree - I think you have inspired me to rant... I have been playing 550 days on the same account - so I remember things that in retrospect I feel were actually bad-  and KLab listened. 

As I've said before I think this is the only gacha game many people on this sub play. They do not understand just how crappy most of the others are. KLab does not have an obligation to give us better rates or even free stuff for that matter- but they choose to give us a ton of free stuff. At this point I don't care that is wasn't as good as last year- we got something- and it wasn't even that bad.

I spent an entire year without a single chappy or other good 5 star accessory to my name- i got beat down like no other in 4th seat repeatedly-I like you just got blue Kenny today and I might finally have a viable chance at 3rd seat. But I have never been mad about my ""misfortune"" I just worked with what I had, managed my orbs wisely (since I don't use money outside of the few steals we had for 4.99) , and most importantly had fun with the game. 

I guess I would just say to those that are really unhappy - the game is great and nothing in life is perfect- if you aren't having fun or are extremely unhappy with a game/developer take a break and maybe you will enjoy the game again on your return! 

And now for the inevitable downvotes :("

5082		czj7nw7	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon		"I'm a 'ghost hunter' so I was actively looking for evidence while staying reasonable, and not jumping to assumptions.  

We went to this old plantation that has a church on the grounds.  We go their a couple times a year because it's old and creepy, and people have experiences there.  Personally I don't tend to believe any one else's experience except my own, and my fiancé because I feel we are the most level headed people in the group.  Mine may not be the most exciting experience, but its one of the very few that I have experienced that I 100% believe was paranormal.  

 I was in the church that was supposed to be haunted, and after sitting there quietly we (a group of about 4) began to hear what sounded like footsteps. At first I just rationalized it as the church settling or whatnot but it really did sound like heavy footsteps, even with a sort of heel-to-toe sound. So I sat in the middle of the aisle where I had been hearing them and you could hear the footsteps walk away from me and towards me. I did scream once because the footstep were so loud (almost stomping) and it was RIGHT beside me. I even felt the floor beneath me vibrate a little.

I have an audio recording somewhere, and I have wanted to post the couple of good audios I have to r/paranormal , but I never have, mostly because I wouldn't trust someone I didn't know's audio, so why would they trust mine?"

5102	czj0r6p	czjbbp6	Warframe	"I will just copy my comment from another thread: 

""I think it would be cool if it turned out that there is a real person inside of Stalker's warframe.
He undergone some kind of surgery to build a warframe around his body and when he found out that other warframes are just remotely operated by children he went insane, cause he's stuck with this infested suit forever.
(Maybe he was tricked to do so ? Or maybe it was just some kind prototype method to build warframes and required a host ? He sacrificed his life and body and later it turned out that a bunch of little sissy ass teenagers can operate warframes with ease ?)"""	"Well, it still hasn't been revealed what's in our Warframes, no? We know that they're remotely controlled, but they also seem to be able to act independently, as evidenced by the end of the second dream quest.

According to the [wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Warframe) warframes were, at one point, referred to as ""exo-armor"" (although that seems to have been removed now), meaning that there is indeed something inside the suit, that needs protecting. Could very well be that all warframes are a combination of Orokin soldier stuck inside the frame and Tenno operator controlling it. Which could potentially make the Stalker a 'frame that gained independence from its operator. 

If it's indeed an Orokin Soldier/Tenno Operator combination that would also explain why the Stalker, who'd be one of such soldiers, is hell-bent on avenging the fallen Orokin empire. He watched the Tenno destroy the Empire, unable to do anything against it, because his own Operator kept him under control - and now he wants revenge.

Drug policy-as well as all other policy-in Iran is dictated by their Supreme Leader.  Parliament can pass any laws they want, but whether their laws are actually laws is up to the Ayatollah.  What are the chances that the supremely conservative Muslim theocracy is going to adopt liberal drug laws?"

That being said, being a graphic designer in college (and already having landed a temp job with it) I may want to pick your brain about how it goes and what should be done (if that's cool with you)

That being said avoid anything mckinley if you can, I just got out of a lease with glencoe hills and this recent manager is yes fixing things up, but still it's got a long way to go, and for what you'd be paying there you'd be getting robbed.

5123	dgyyp2q	dgyyw2y	AskReddit	"Homeless shelters (in my experience) are terrible. It sounds like you care, which makes a difference. Believe me, as a formerly homeless addict, we can tell who gives a shit and who is punching the clock. That was the biggest eye opener during my recovery, that strangers actually gave a shit. My family and friends were gone by the time I made it to shelters and eventually rehab, but these people I just met actually cared, and wanted to help me. I doubt I would have any clean time right now if it wasn't for the 2 or 3 people at rehab who genuinely cared. 

I have done electrical work for 17 years, but after my first experience with social programs, and the frustration that comes with, I went back to school for human services. Sure, I made more money doing electrical, but I was miserable. More money just means bigger bills and a more complicated budget.

5145		czjasp2	NUFC		"Stoke 

what the fuck"
5146		dkzs3f9	BigBrother		"Paul saved the word ""friendship"" last season from the taint of s6 and this season he has brought it back down into that cesspool"
5147	czje4a8	czjet6u	SandersForPresident	"As an HRC supporter... a lot of people don't realize that she's got VERY similar views to Sanders, they share a LOT in common. Their major differences are that Sanders takes a revolutionary approach and thus goes miles further. Hillary is an incrementalist, for better for for worse. I'm a fan of the ""chip away slowly"" strategy, but I give Sanders credit where it's due :)"	The problem is people don't know which policies they're actually supporting with Hillary. 
5148	dkxxyfr	dkzyfgw	Frat	"Armani acqua di Gio.

Or just pour a couple of beers over your hair. Girls go wild for that beer scent."	I've been between that and mont blanc. My other colognes never get used 
5149		dgz07a0	buddythunderstruck		I have official run out of ideas to write about, and have thus began meme production. What am I doing with my life? I mean, this isn't even dank!
5150	dgyxyur	dgyy3tc	EdmontonOilers	Lol you're telling me [this](https://www.nhl.com/video/silfverbergs-second-of-the-game/t-289075706/c-51773903) goal was Talbot's fault? Aside from the 4th goal none of them were his fault. And if you're going to tell me Talbot is the reason we went 4 down you weren't watching the game. The type of chances Anaheim were getting they would have scored vs LB eventually.	"That 5th goal, if Talbot was playing like he normally does, he would of had. He saw the puck, but didnt hustle enough to get over. He 9/10 times stops that puck.

The idea behind pulling the goalie isnt only because the goalie is having a bad game. He allowed 3 goals on the first 5 shots no matter how you slice it. You pull the goalie to send a message to the team. It was clearly not his night, as depicted by the game winner and the 2 that followed. Talbots one of my favorite players, but he was bad tonight."
5151	czjb1l0	czjbmlt	AdviceAnimals	Do you not think that overpopulation is a problem, at both the national and world levels?	Oh yes, definitely. But we won't hit that issue for hundreds if not thousands of years. I mean Macau has the highest population density in the world and is gorgeous. The world will just turn into one big giant city and then just build up. Currently the USA has a VERY low population density so it really is not an issue.
5152	dgyv99r	dgyvd5j	Persona5	You need to hang out with them. Also having a matching Arcana Persona improves how quickly you can progress the confidant level. You don't need matching Arcana's for Sun and Moon.	but my question was that if hanging with them even having that text was worth it to get the next rank in Arcana.
5153		dkzomjr	INJUSTICE		Not really necessary, sort of defeats the purpose of the multiverse 
5154	dgysuup	dgysxn3	SquaredCircle	Odds had Jericho winning, my dude. 	Oops I'm sorry I made a mistake 
5155		dkzudlp	healthnet		[removed]
5156	dkzo7p3	dkzojum	CanadaPolitics	Is Watts further right? She is pretty good on the environment and transit at least.	She is a federal Conservative and I believe the other two are Liberals. That said there are a few further right than Watts I hope don't end up running. I heard a James Moore rumour as well.
5157	dkzrbuf	dkzs5ib	Cubers	Oh, I did it slightly differently. I paired all the edges then inserted them like they are meant to be. In other words the First 3 Layers were solved completely. Like F2L with a 3x3. Was I not supposed to do that?	You can't have paired all of the edges, since several of the yellow edges are paired incorrectly.

5159	czjackv	czjbawc	AdviceAnimals	It isn't an urban myth, it just takes more than a few chocolate bars to actually cause damage.	"The whole ""die in a fire"" response though?  Someone's got issues"

5161	dgyw7up	dgywi2t	Catholicism	I don't actually believe that you were confused about this.	Ok
5162		dgyrzjn	BattleRite		Hell yeah! Thanks for the feature!
5163	dkzmo4c	dkzo5la	Browns	Line up in 2-2-1, then have Duke go wide out	"A CB on duke is not a match up in our favor. 

You really think crow and duke is much of a running formation?  Maybe in the pre 1970s.  Now they will play a big nickel on you. You will have a SS flying into duke on runs. How long will he last taking those hits? 


The patriots noticed the best coverage people on the defense were corners. They took advantage of that by playing 2 TEs or a strong slot wr as the 3rd wr.  The best 2 defenders were on the wide outs.  

By going 2-2, you are basically freeing up one of the better coverage defenders to take away you second best receiver which could be duke or Njoku. Crow basically is a blocker or dump off on pass plays. On runs, you at a disadvantage.  The defense will be playing pass and not afraid of the run because they know a LB or Safety can beat the block by the other RB. Crow doesn't block blitzes very well as it is. Thinking he will lead duke on runs is optimistic. 

Look, I'm not saying we can't go 2-2 a few plays a game. But that is not something you should be a major part of the offense. 

"
5164		czj7qaw	OrlandoMagic		One thing I've learnt from this match is that winning is better than losing.

5166	czj9w57	czjab89	Silverbugs	Awesome! :) BPM gave a lot of us a hell of a deal!	"And I am very grateful to be one of the lucky ones, but what happened to all the great BPM deals? I haven't seen anything earth shattering since the 1oz monkeys. 

Edit: I don't think this premium is anything new. I bought 1 for a buddy of mine for $27.09 on DEC 9 from JMB."

"	"We have a Scandinavian shoppe near where I live that I'm convinced is a ""front"" for something. Mostly because I'm convinced the police would be too freaked out by all the trolls just...staring at them from **everywhere** to investigate the place.

5171	cziluqf	czj6svb	SquaredCircle	eh. You can never tell. I'm sure Billy knows who to call about it - I just don't think him being a musician holds any sway over that. It's definitely a part of how Grado got over though. The smart money would be to find something *really* dated and cheesy that licences for much less - something like Tubthumping by Chumbawumba for example - and make that his thing.	"""Two of Hearts"" by Stacey Q, too.

(Just realized this'll be the second notification you'll get from me next time you log on. I promise I'm not stalking you, good sport.)"
5172	dkzsbdo	dkzsgca	amiiboSwap	"NIB Luigi and Ryu?

Edit: both NIB 1p

Edit: Sorry I was looking at my list"	No thank you, I can still get 1st Print Ryu around my area. Also, I post a picture of the CP Isabelle Card to show prove I have it.
5173		dgz06ax	UniversityOfHouston		She can park in the welcome center garage or the stadium garage. Both have adequate visitor parking. There's also meter parking around campus but I noticed that gets busy after 9AM. 
5174		dkzokap	TaliyahMains		Taliyah is much stronger than ahri and lux, but not because of her damage. She is strong because of how strong her ultimate is if used correctly, how deadly your full combo is if you can hit it, and how good she is at kiting. 
5175	dkzkl75	dkzwaai	NatureIsFuckingLit	[verwijderd]	They also grow to be 400+ years old
5176		dgz1dj7	Pareidolia		Who took a bite of of one and put it back? The bastard. 
5177	dgyyeg0	dgyyi50	SiliconValleyHBO	Just realized Gavin acquired Piper Chat explicitly so that he could get Barker's chat logs. 	Didn't catch that, that's great
5178		czjcsxu	Biochemistry		Depends on the assay. By them selves, hoagie assays aren't necessarily more sensitive. It's the grinder assays magnification of response that yields increases in sensitivity. Like the western blot. One antibody bind an epitope, another antibody bind s that which is conjugated to an enzyme which produces 1000s of activated light emitting molecules. So approx. 1000 x amplification in signal. PBJ assays can, but don't have to, similarly amplify signals.
5179	czj5fg3	czj8rm9	PercyJacksonRP	"""And...?"" "	"""And he doesn't know how to talk to her, so we've been working on it."""
5180	czj9xor	czjabis	CFB	"check your numbers. per 247:

OSU - 26, 31, 29, 26 = 112

FSU - 20, 29, 22, 19 = 90

that's an entire extra recruiting class that OSU processed "	Those numbers include LOTS of walkons for OSU for some reason. Look for the guys with no stars.
5181		dkznoys	LitecoinMarkets		Any where to watch Charlie on CNBC asia online? should be on in an hour right?
5182	czitpd6	czjcoif	TwoXChromosomes	Seriously, what the actual fuck. Does this really exist?	In the great state of Arizona any dr can withold information they believe could lead you to terminate your pregnancy. Those fancy tests to detect  fetal defects are only as useful as the spirituality of the person reading them.

That's like, as pathetic as it gets. Talking shit behind people's backs on fucking Reddit. 

Lmao adios buddy, hope you graduate from Reddit someday and realize upvotes and PM's don't mean shit.

I got 3 upvotes on my comment to yours earlier btw, does that mean I'm better than you at Reddit? Ahahahahah."	how do I think im sick tf lmao.

To be fair though that cut buy Jose looks like a no doubter.	"Eh, I was on the 3B line and it seemed a bit low to make it out, I was on my feet willing it up with my screams but  not a no-doubter, but it was definitely the best drive that day.

5197	dgxzhxw	dgywekt	GolfGTI	Congrats! It isn't often you hear about a deal on an R. I thought they were pretty much MSRP. 	my father almost got a R over his 15 GTI. it had some weird options and had been on the lot for quite some time. i think they offered it to him and GTI sticker price.

Even if there's a purpose what's the purpose for that purpose? And so on? If there is an ultimate truth is it possible to be understood? 	"Of course I wonder many of those things. Unfortunately, I believe it is out of our scope to answer anything on a truly fundamental level, since you can always ask how or why ad infinitum. 

However, being a believer of the afterlife, I like to think that all ultimate truths will b fully understood in the afterlife. "

5202	cyvuvnn	czja3zy	AskReddit	AdBlock plus is an absolute must for browsing Youtube in my opinion. I also whitelist the chanels I support, because im not an asshole.	uBlock Origin is more lightweight and actually does more for your security of your PC than Adblock.  It's also opensource so no hidden crap in it.  Make sure you get the uBlock ORIGIN though and not just regular uBlock.

5204	dkznx5i	dkzolsa	AO3	">You can send yourself PMs over reddit, but to my knowledge it has the same shortcomings as sending yourself an email.

I *think* the concept can work, though. I'll elaborate with what I'm thinking how it could work (I seriously need to finish doing my python tutorial, lol). So, I think it has something to do with linking the bot to its own reddit username (or email?), and then making it do the 'if this then that' structure: ""if results of programmed daily scan of <search results URL> feature workIDs that don't match yesterday's, PM /u/username with that workID's <title>,<tags> & <summary>.""

The subreddit mentions bot - it scans *all* reddit pages (idk how often) & PMs me whenever my subreddits have been mentioned anywhere elsewhere on Reddit. To set it up, I needed to send it a PM that configured it/subscribed me to it ([here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Sub_Mentions&subject=Action%3A%20Subscribe&message=%7B%0A%0A%22subreddit%22%3A%20%22subreddit_name%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%0A%22karma%22%3A%201%2C%0A%0A%22filter-users%22%3A%20%5B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%22automoderator%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22totesmessenger%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22autotldr%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22user_history_bot%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22imagesofnetwork%22%2C%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%22sneakpeekbot%22%20%20%20%20%0A%0A%5D%2C%0A%0A%22filter-subreddits%22%3A%20%5B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%22spam%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22redditrequest%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22pariscomments%22%0A%0A%5D%0A%0A%7D)). 

I feel like a similar thing could happen here where I'd PM the bot the AO3 search results URL, which basically orders it to scrape that URL once a day for any new workIDs in the CSS (would need extra coding to 'remember/record' the old workIDs, whereas the sub mentions bot doesn't have to remember anything... but if it can be done by a userscript to remember old workIDs, I think a python bot can... or actually I wonder if the bot could *use* the userscript and it just pulls the title-highlighted fics' workIDs-?). 

Once the bot scrapes & gets the new workIDs from that URL, it can basically do something like what FanfictionBot does: uses http://ficsave.xyz/ to pull all the relevant details of the fic with *just* its workID number, and sends them to you in a PM. 

...I wonder if you could have this hypothetical bot actually just interact *with* fanfictionbot. Like, it scrapes for new WorkIDs, then PMs fanfictionbot with formatting that *that* bot needs in order to pull up all the relevant details of the fic -- you just have to PM that bot with this message in the bodytext, and it can handle more than one fic listing per PM: 

    linkao3(WorkIDNumber) 

Fanfictionbot replies back with those details, hypothetical-bot receives them, copies their source, and then sends them to the user that had configured this hypothetical-bot to receive these fics to begin with. 

That ORRRRR I wonder if /u/tusing would be interested in adding a thing to FanfictionBot where, if you send a PM to their bot (fanfictionbot) with a certain formatted title like ""Send To: /u/stophaunting"" then it won't reply back to the *sender* but rather it'll PM /u/stophauntingme the fics' details-?

That way, the hypothetical-bot would grab all the new workerIDs in the search results URL, PM FanfictionBot with the designated subject line ""Send To: /u/StopHauntingMe"" + all the listings (in the form of ""linkao3(workID#)"" and then from *there*, FanfictionBot would create a new message to the user specified in the subject line & send along the fic details to the right user..."	I don't disagree that what you're describing is possible, I just don't understand why you would do it like that. If it's just for you, then email or writing to a file would suffice. If you want to (and can) provide it as a service to potentially hundreds of people, you could write a web server that accepts an arbitrary ao3 query string, sends a request to ao3, parses the HTML, and serialises it as RSS/Atom for the public.

She will see this. If not her actually putting eyes on it, it will be summarized for her and she'll at least have some due diligence performed. 
5210	czipj94	czje5t5	GlobalOffensive	Oh my god, yes. I have no idea why the game needs to reconnect to the same map I just played instead of just resetting the values. There must be a reason.	The game can do this but it requires some other svar, dont remember exactly which. But this is mainly for servers that just run the same map over and over. And Valve hasn't implemented a check to detect whether the voted map is the same as the current one so it juat does a changelevel instead.
5211	dgyyyer	dgyzy9s	AskReddit	We usually call those people csgo youtubers	I'll be honest, I'm not sure what that term means, but the guys I'm talking about existed long before YouTube. I was thinking about taking a craps seminar from a guy 21 or 22 years ago to learn how to play until I found out how much it cost and I found out it wasn't a class to teach you how to play the game but it was a dice control class.

5216	dkz7vez	dkzneew	ADHD	You should try exercise or other physical exertion before starting off the day. 	"Really, this is the answer.  Two issues:  I was starting work at 7 am - which I'm going to change to 8 or 830 start - and a half hour commute.  

Not sure if this is an ADD thing, but I do find the commute wearing.  I was trying to get exercise after I arrive, but I thought up too many reasons to skip exercise on the drive in.  Perhaps I should try before leaving to drive."

5222	czirwoh	czj8mxc	AskReddit	"I build others up. I'm secure enough that I don't see others as rivals and confident enough that I can generously give reassurance to the people around me, who I value not for what I can gain by taking, but for their own sake. Humility is a sign of true confidence.

Games are for the desperate and fearful. You don't need to focus on others and their relative status. Lead by being someone worth following."	You say that until you meet a singlet wearing bulge monster that proceeds to powerslam you through the conference table.

One was the Note Edge launch and the other was something about 4G. I wrote both and sent them. After they liked it, they sent me a training manual, and oh my god, it was awesome. The pay was bi-weekly and they pay on per article basis (which I think what most International blogs do). The amount would increase if you write more articles in two weeks. For example 0 to 20 articles in two weeks would get you $3/article but 21 - 40 would get you $4/article. This is just an example, I don't remember the exact numbers.

Also, the manual stated that the minimum word count for a news article would be 300-350 and maximum time limit was one hour."	Daamn $3 per article?  That's far far faaar lower than I ever expected. That's not even remotely worth the time. No wonder most of the content is so low quality. Why do the writers even bother at that pay?

I like it cause I get good support in the middle, so it's harder to lose the ball. Also, having a CDM really helps me with defending. And occasionally the wider CM's actually play like wingers lol. Not to mention that front trio, they're usually close together so you can do some quick passing to get through the defense, or use them as diversion. They're also deadly in counter attacks.

BATTLE MODE, a real battle mode. the one single complaint anyone had with MK8 was addressed, and done justice no less. Anyone who put HOURS into any previous battle mode knows that's worth a lot in itself.

Ideologically pure capitalism would privatize *everything*, and that has the potential to go to hell in a handbasket rather quickly.  Would you rather have a ""socialist"" fire department maintained by the state, or a purely capitalist one that is motivated purely by profit and would be tempted to cut corners to benefit the stakeholders?  Would you rather have Nestle managing the water supply in your area, or a bunch of socialists?

The suggestions are sexism to both genders, vast rejections of reality, and frankly I worry about how that kid is going to function in school. 	"Insult me if you want, but please deal with my argument substantively. 

We're also coming at this from different perspectives. You're assuming sexist advice is always bad advice. When colleges and courts and the news don't assume by default that men are rapists waiting to pounce, then advice telling men to avoid being caught with their pants metaphorically or literally down in situations that put them in a bad light, even and especially if they are innocent will be meaningless. Until then, I think it's pretty solid advice.

Besides, if we're talking about rejecting reality, your proposed solution seems to be ""hope things will work out for the best and that no one will screw you over because they maybe won't."" And maybe they really won't. But it won't cost much to prep as if they will and it'll save you if they do. "

5286	dgyru1y	dgys18l	GlobalOffensive	There has been randomness in map vetoes in some tournaments. Never heard any positive feedback about it. I personally don't see why randomness would be any good. If teams want to play Nuke/Train/Inferno most of the time, just let them. I'd rather watch the teams play their best maps, instead of playing maps they're not as good on.	Randomness is good or bad depending on how you look at it I guess.  Bad for the players, but good for the spectators if they're looking for a little more variety in maps watched.  Over the course of a long tournament, watching the same maps played way more than the others can get a bit stale, but maybe that's just me.

Also, change Hades his ult to work like Pos his whirlpool and with the current setup of Season 3, Hades can be a top tier Support."	You know, i keep bringing this up to my buddies. The problem with tanks was never them being tanky. They're supposed to be. The problem with them is they share base damage values and %scaling with mages, instead of you know, doing less damage because they're tanks. The justification for this is that supports tend to be behind due to xp and leveling. So what's the obvious answer to these problems? nerf base damage values and change how proximity xp/gold is given, thus putting not only supports, but junglers in a better place to teamfight? No, nerf cooldown, nerf armor and health values, and nerf select CC gods while leaving other problematic ones untouched. It just really really confuses me that they'd absolutely destroy their set meta that was so close to being balance outside of a few problem gods, and instead completely destroy the balance of the game to try something that seems to not be working for the most part. Jungle now seems like a lane partner instead of a ganker, supports end up roaming far more often in order to get more xp to stay relevant, and most god options for jungle have been severely reduced to a key few that offer the instant burst of damage needed to kill someone, then quickly return to your lane partner mid. The entire meta so far just seems like incredible backtrack to s1 early s2 which is what we spent all of s2 trying to get away from.

5292	dkzoft0	dkzpduh	FreeCompliments	"There's a great quote from Captain Picard that gets turned into a motivational meme a lot around Reddit, but it's definitely applicable here: *""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.""*  

It's rare to have the feeling and knowledge that you didn't make any missteps, that you did everything you could have, when at the end of a relationship. Rarer still is having the person you're splitting from acknowledge that to you; it takes a mature person to accept that something isn't working out, without dumping all of their problems onto the other person in a mad bid to convince themselves that they're not the one at fault. If you feel the same way about her, then it's entirely possible that no one is at fault here. Sometimes personalities just don't click, or for whatever reason people aren't feeling it. It happens, and it really sucks because you're tempted to spend hours, days, and weeks wondering what you did wrong, what could have been done differently. I'm telling you now, having been there myself, don't do that to yourself.  

The best thing you can do is to accept that each of you have your own paths through life to tread, and while yours may not include her as you thought it would, that doesn't make it any less important or meaningful. Take a little time to be single and re-connect with who you are and what you want. What are your most deepest-held beliefs and values? What do you want more than anything out of life? If you take some time and answer these questions with yourself, it will help immensely when you get back out there and look for love again.  

Humans have been meeting compatible partners for millions of years, I have full faith that you can right the ship with a little time to converse with yourself. Just remember to hold who you are very tightly, and while it's important to be flexible on the small stuff in a relationship, don't ever compromise who you are for someone else. Stay strong, keep your chin up, and stay positive. We're all rooting for you here. :)"	Hey man idk if I can give you points for this but this made my night to read. Thanks for posting.

What's going on here is an induced vomiting. Basically we take a drug called apomorphine to make your dog puke. Works great for recent ingestions of some foreign objects and poisons. You can do this at home by making them drink a small amount of hydrogen peroxide too. 

However, one thing this video illustrates really well is ""abdominal effort."" those dry heaves you see before he vomits are what help us differentiate ""vomiting"" from ""regurgitation."" regurgitation can occur hours after eating, but many people just call it ""vomiting/puking"" incorrectly. If you can show your vet that you know the difference, it will really help us pinpoint certain diseases/pathologies and make us love you forever. 

Edit: 

Home vomit recipe (3% hydrogen peroxide): 1 teaspoon per 5 lbs., not to exceed 3 tablespoons. 

This dog is vomiting. Vomiting is an active process, while regurgitation is not. Vomiting is often after signs of nausea (licking lips, drooling, inappetance) and abdominal effort (heaving). Regurgitation occurs very suddenly and even midstride. "	So which is in the video

The problem is that we don't have any evidence that human beings innately possess some type of similar moral code, or that the universe has a moral code.

So in the State of Nature there's no such thing as ""murder"" there is just intentional killing. Murder is a dangerous word for you to throw around by the way, because it has a component of being illegal, and it assumes or implies a wrongful or morally wrong killing. So using the word is sort of like begging the question.

If Sam has a banana farm and George wants the banana farm, in the State of Nature where there is no prior agreement or understanding between the two, of course George can take the banana farm. He should probably kill or enslave Sam while doing so because leaving Sam free after taking the banana farm will likely lead Sam to try to kill George while he sleeps and take back the banana farm.

Murder is wrong in our society and to me, but in your hypothetical situation where there is just Sam and George and a banana farm there is no such thing as murder, and George killing Sam for it is neither right nor wrong. We can have a debate about whether it is the optimal decision, but we'd need a more complex scenario."

I'll not soon forget a night in the early '80's, not longer after I graduated from high school, when a friend of mine was visiting after having spent some time in England. We were out in a bar, and he asked me for a cigarette using British vernacular, ""Would you spot me fag old chap?"" I swear, ice cubes stopped falling in mid air.

There's not a lot of diversity in the area. That lack of diversity, as a matter of course, leads to some attitudes and prejudices that are difficult to overcome. Those attitudes and prejudices are obvious to anyone who has spent a significant part of their lives living elsewhere. I do have nuanced discussions with some of my classmates, but all of those friends did spend a good part of their lives living outside the Green Bay area. This isn't a lack of education. It's a lack of experience.

How can there be a presumption of innocence in a society where people are quick to judge and given to many prejudices that are, more often than not, fueled by rumor and gossip?

You get to choose what kind of hunter you are.  The points you allocate directly impact what abilities and equipment you have access to.  A player who puts all his points into Strength and Vitality plays significantly different than one who puts his points into Bloodtinge and Arcane.  The former is built to get up in someone's face and trade hits with something like the Kirkhammer, while the latter has traded durability and melee power for much stronger guns and access to magic items.

And while you could theoretically max out all your stats in Bloodborne, it'd take far beyond the normal playtime to do it.  In a normal playthrough, you don't come close to a fully maxed out character.

>You don't choose a role in Final Fantasy (except 1, 3 and 5), you don't choose a role in Tales.

This actually brings up a really interesting topic.  Most JRPGs *aren't* RPGs.  It's the reason the term ""JRPG"" is so divisive; they really contain very little role-playing.  The first ones, like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, were aping D&D on limited technology and have more in common with traditional RPGs.  They quickly veered off into their own style, though.  One that concentrated more on stories with defined characters instead of the player freedom that gives rise to role-playing.

If I had to rename them, I'd actually call the genre ""narrative adventure.""  Obviously that's not going to happen, but I feel like this is why JRPGs have become one of those things where it's hard to define, but ""I'll know it when I see it.""  They retain a few superfluous elements of D&D but abandoned the underlying purpose of tabletop games where ""RPG"" was coined.

I mean, I like JRPGs.  I just accept that their genre name is something of a misnomer."	"&gt; You get to choose what kind of hunter you are.

5402	dgyooih	dgyzvj5	Honda	100% random shots in the dark - Electrical problem? Battery? Wiring from the ignition? If you have a radio put into it, maybe a wire shorting? I have no idea what it could be, but maybe any of those random things could help find the problem?	"To add to this, are you sure there's not a loose connection somewhere? If something is loose or a wire has come un-done and is shorting itself it could definitely be a culprit. Unfortunately this requires going in and checking *everything*. Best to use a multimeter or dummy light. 

A bad alternator or battery would explain the symptoms. Testing an alternator in a car is tricky, it's not always going to give you a correct answer. If you have the money, you can swap a new cheapo battery into it and see if the problem persists. I had a guy tell me an alternator was bad when it was really just the battery.

Lastly (and this is a shot in the dark tbh) if your timing belt tensioner isn't pulling the belt tight enough it won't turn the A/C compressor or the alternator. I doubt that's the problem but I've seen it happen before (and you'd be seeing other symptoms)  

As for the buzzing sound, some cars do that when there's not enough juice to start. I had an old Saab where all of the needles would freak out and start bouncing around if the battery was too flat to start the car. "

5475	czj3xtz	czjeehq	Gender_Critical	[verwijderd]	"I agree with Astraloid that the industry is driven by misogyny. I believe very strongly that the reason so many people are into BDSM and their particular kinks within it is because we are socialized in this society to view and glorify sex as an act of violence and degradation perpetrated on a passive partner, usually a woman. Particularly within the BDSM world you can see a massive overlap between male sexual submission and sissification, crossdressing, forced feminization etc. where dominatrices, for instance, rarely dress as men. I engage in BDSM and believe that experience at times to be cathartic (get all that messed up gender socialization out of the way in fantasy land and then revert to having to consciously push against it all day long in the real world, which is exhausting).

For a woman with a true fetish i.e. she cannot orgasm without at least fantasizing about submission/BDSM, because she internalized a lot of sexually violent and damaging gender messages in early childhood, possibly was a victim of sexual abuse - do we expect her to never have an orgasm for the sake of political correctness? Certainly we need to be helping women understand these effects. As women, our sexuality is attacked and stilted by our upbringing. Culture and my environment may have shaped my sexual psyche in an unhealthy, undesirable way, but after coming to terms with that and trying for a long time to change it I find I can't, and I find myself unwilling to deny myself one of the few pleasures life provides.

This is not the level of self-awareness with which most people in ""the scene"" and certainly not at mainstream production companies/professional dungeons are operating. I personally would LOVE to see a whole lot more time dedicated to the discussion of the psychologically safe practice of BDSM."

Ok we just got this place and in the basement there is a bathroom with a toilet , sink and shower. Also there is a laundry sink nearby. 
In the basement there is a waste pump, or sump pump. 
The issue is whenever the pump runs, it causes the bathroom sink (and a few moments later the laundry sink) to gargle or bubble. Occasionally it releases a bit of a smell as well. 
The previous owner installed the air access valve you see in the picture under the bathroom sink. it seems to work (as in, it allows air in but not out) when I test it, but it doesn't fix the issue.
I have read that an air valve like that needs to be 6"" above the trap, so do you think that's the issue?
Or could it be something else entirely?
Any help figure this out is appreciated.

g(2) should be -2, since f(x) lies below the x-axis on that interval.

We use f(t) dt because we already have x in the bounds, and it makes no sense for x to be the variable of integration *and* the upper bound for the integral. t is called the dummy variable, and we could've used any letter in its place. For example, we could have written int 1 to x f(u) du or int 1 to x f(p) dp."	"&gt; since x2 is positive close to x = 0. The answer should be 3 instead of 4.

My mistake, the answer is 3. But I still don't understand how it's even approaching 1 from the left. f(0) is 2 but it doesn't go near 1 by looking at the graph from what I'm seeing. Furthermore, how does this fact prove the answer to be 3?

5548	dkzozut	dkzp3gw	Torontobluejays	Estrada only threw five pitches in the first? Damn. 	Read your comment before checking the score. Expected 5 runs scored by CWS.
5549	dkzo4o4	dkzvaog	Calgary	[verwijderd]	Their Detour is a pretty good session ale
5550	dkzk6zr	dkztfwa	Cloud9	My biggest question would simply be what the structure of Dota 2 esports is. I always see the International roll around each year, but outside of that what sort of league or tournaments are there for Dota?	"Riot has a theory of acquiring funding (like coke sponsoring their events) and doing all the legwork themselves and hiring everyone where valve works the opposite, they prefer(ed) to fund themselves and then delegate all the work themselves.

Keep in mind valve is a billion dollar company with like 250 employees. They don't hire esports people whatsoever.

For the last two years valve funded 5 majors (3 million dollar prize) and two TI's (20 and 23 million dollars), with the intention of letting the rest of the year play out organically.  

Any online league that exists (I know of two legitimate ones, Dreamleague ran by dreamhack, which is a small 8 team league with a 4 team lan final) and Prodota (kinda like a self-organized Challenger Series with tier 2/tier3 teams). 

It's a lot like CSGO this next year where there will be tournament organizers hosting their own things, and valve has a new idea to just give money to organizers who host 500k prizepool events (doubing the prize pool) and calling them majors, and rewarding players for attending by giving them points. Minors also will occur allowing players to earn points at lesser events, valve will again double the prizepool if it's over 150,000$ (300k)

So next year the system is different and the SOLE FACTOR for determining the invitations to TI8 (Next year's ti) is these new major/minor points. The only other way to reach majors/ti is the same way to reach any event, qualify online.

But again, there still will be relatively zero league-play for top teams, league play like NALCS or ESL Pro League doesn't really happen in dota at all. "

I get: Jared Goff, 1.09, Allen Hurns

I don't have a 3rd QB behind my two starters, which is the only reason i'm even considering this. I would probably take LF/Caff with that 1.02, i'm pretty sure the 1.01 is going to go Davis. MY RB's are Ajayi/Dixon/Lacy/Gio Do people like Goff enough to drop this far for him?"

5560	dkzqaxo	dkzuvl3	TheSilphRoad	I raided at the local deaf University today. The raid was half-hearing and half-deaf. None of the hearing folks could sign, so we had to figure out how to communicate that everyone was ready to go. My kids threw a fit, I spilled milk all inside my diaper bag, and my youngest slapped my hand and made me lose a ball. I caught Arti anyway. The stories augment the catches for me. A guy tried to high-5 my kid after the catch and the kid kicked him instead. 2 is a fun age. 	I'm a SAHM with a 2 year old too, and my goal is also just one of each legendary.

5565	cziqmft	czjb0fz	OutOfTheLoop	"Kim's sex tape isn't new at all. In fact, it is the thing that helped make her famous. 

Kim's biological father, Robert Kardashian, was a famous lawyer who defended OJ Simpson in the ""trial of the century"". Kim was good friends with Paris Hilton, and also her assistant. Kim was also Lindsay Lohan's personal stylist at one point. This all brought her a fair bit of fame. She was *maybe* on the ""D-List"" at this point. 

Around 2007 is when she started hanging out with Ray J. The sex tape was with Ray J, famous mostly for being Brandy's brother. The sex tape was released with her consent by Vivid Entertainment. 

The tape got her a fair amount of attention and notoriety. This meant that Kim was considered interesting enough for a reality show. Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered soon after and is still going strong. Kim is more famous than ever, considered one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and is one of the most followed people on Twitter and Instagram.

I believe the sex tape is circulating again to poke fun at Kanye after his fight with Amber Rose. He basically married a woman who's rise on the social ladder began by having sex with another man."	"&gt; considered one of the 100 most influential people in the world

Maybe to People magazine..."

5569	dkzwyqz	dkzy5at	Broadway	">orchestrations when they really mean instrumentation


I mean, that's the lion's share there, let's not kid ourselves. Great Comet set itself apart  from the competition in having these rich, clever orchestrations that often include the ensemble as a voice in the orchestra (it's rarer than it should be to have musical theatre where the vocals and instruments complement one another in a symbiotic way, vs. forcing the pit to play bland accompaniments - one of the benefits of having the composer also orchestrate). Those percussive elements and gorgeous chords are unrivaled in anything else this season. And that's not even taking into account Dave Malloy's brilliant use of dissonance and multiple genres, the cello parts that are *completely different from one another*, the use of the clarinet, oboe, and accordians to build the Russian atmosphere... It's a musicans' score, through and through.


Did DEH have a perfectly serviceable rock pop orchestration? Sure. There were moments I actually quite enjoyed (Sincerely Me stands out in having a bit of personality to it in the backing; definitely the highlight).


But was in the top four among all shows this season, much less the *best*? I haven't met a single musican who would argue that.  It does what it's supposed to do, but Great Comet was on a whole other level of complexity and musiciality. Less accessible to people that aren't familiar with classical, probably, but I don't think any of us want to see awards simply go to the most digestible nominees.


I'm highly confident that if the subject matter expert voting rules were in effect this year, DEH absolutely would not have won."	"Fair enough. Im just biased because I'm not a huge fan of GC (but I haven't really given it much of a chance TBH)

5571	dkziguv	dkzrkie	StreetFighter	I think they are just burn, they need to rest maybe take a time out of the fgc eyes, if you remember by the end of ultra they were tired of ultra, I remember gooteck talking about been ready for the new game, and back in 3s he wasn't ready to move to 4.	yeah man but...its only been a little over a year. That is a lot of burnout in a short amount of time when compared to 3 and 4

5575	dkzsqpb	dkztp7b	CODZombies	Out of if the loop,  but what'd she do this time? 	Bought a leaked, unfinished trailer for SHG's Nazi Zombie mode from the leaker who was profiting off of it, then put up a YouTube video with a cipher that had to be solved to gain the password to watch the video, with her watermark taking up the screen, on her website. She then blocked anyone on Twitter calling her out, and tried to spin it as if she was the victim. She finally did a 100 Zombie Timeline poster giveaway as an apology.
5576	dkzu2an	dkzuj0p	LosAngeles	that's a good point. 	I always suspected this was what the sweepers were really meant to clean. No other city I can think of sweeps twice a week, every week. 
5577		dgyso9p	YoutubersCSGO		"This is something I could have watched while chilling for sure! If you're looking for tips on how to improve, I would recommend spending a little more time on the effects, maybe get some cool transitions etc. All in all, great video.

Will have to get me a smurf account, lol moments like that never happen in supreme xd"
5578	dgyr2cc	dgz1gd1	MMORPG	"I like having an overarching story, but I don't think the player character should be the pre-destined hero (actually I hate that in single-player games too). Done right, you can have multiple factions that you can align yourself with, possibly fighting people that aligned themselves with the others.

I think without any story at all, the world seems bland.

Of course I will never play BotW, so I won't know how well they pulled it off."	"The thing about stories is that it forces the player to follow a predetermined path, which makes players feel like they have to take that specific path even though there's a world of directions they could take.

If it were me, I'd write the story so that the order in which you read the chapters doesn't detract from the quality of the story told. It can be done in any order whenever you happened to find it. This would likely be done like solving a mystery. Beats the whole hero cliche as well.

If you know any friends irl who own botw, definitely make an excuse to go play it. It's worth it."

Happens in *First Contact* as well - Picard gives the order to beam the surviving members of the Defiant's crew onboard the Enterprise while the Borg cube is still active. Shields are never mentioned and 30 seconds later Worf shows up on the bridge.

I mean, I guess they *could've* dropped their shields for a split-second...but I highly doubt it. Especially since the Enterprise was under direct attack at the time."

5594	czj36p6	czj45l9	Economics	">Is it true that central banks always allow lending to increase? I thought the whole point of central banks increasing interest rates and reserve requirements is to prevent banks from lending.

Yes and no. Central banks do impose constraints which limit the quantity of bank lending but reserve requirements don't fall into that category.

There are two completely different but essential concepts here. Reserves are balances held by a bank in its account at the central bank and their purpose is daily settlement of deposit transactions. Reserve requirements are about liquidity--making sure that banks manage settlement costs and that interbank ""checks"" don't ever bounce. When banks need additional reserves, they obtain them from other banks or from the central bank.

The second is capital, which is basically balance sheet equity for a bank. The purpose of regulatory capital requirements being to force banks to have a cushion of solvency against loan losses. New loans expand the size of a bank's balance sheet and capital requirements put the brakes on this by enforcing a ratio of net assets (equity) to total assets. When banks need more capital (more balance sheet assets in excess of balance sheet liabilities) they retain profits or sell shares in equity markets.

"	"But if a bank gives out infinite loans, then doesn't their liquidity drop by definition? What if the people taking out loans decide they want cash instead of depositing it at a bank? I don't see how liquidity is compatible with unlimited lending unless the central bank is lending at zero percent interest (they are currently close, but that's another story).

Edit: this is a total diversion anyway, banks simply don't lend to risky ventures at all. The original point was about loans as investments, and banks don't lend to risky ventures unless they're guaranteed or collateralized."

5596		czjdj04	Philippines		Honestly, without structural economic and political reforms, low crude oil price will hurt the country in the long-run because in infrastructure alone, low crude oil price will worsen traffic jam in Metro Manila especially as motorists can now use their cars as much as possible. Another, more Filipinos would have to be retrenched from their jobs in oil dependent Middle East countries and the country is unlikely to reabsorb them soon.

5605		dkznt0p	iRacing		"Welcome! First I recommend checking out the Wiki tab here on reddit to read a brief overview of the most important systems. Its not fully filled out yet sorry, but some info there to help you get started.

Second, watch the getting started videos on iRacings Youtube page. Some of these are out of date a bit, but still helpful nonetheless.

Third, read the sporting code once you become a member. This will cover everything.

&gt; Best deal

There are a few new member deals floating around. A couple are listed over in the sidebar here ---&gt; Not sure if any are still active though.

&gt; how not to anger people as a new driver

Practice a lot before you race and treat people as you would want to be treated. Ill just say that you already have a big leg up on many new drivers in that you understand the simple concept of empathy. Some people just drive like there arent other humans in the other cars.

In terms of practice time, it depends on how skilled you are. Do you have any background at all in sim racing or is iRacing your first venture into this world? Do you have any background in understanding motorsports in general. Do you watch racing? Do you understand racing concepts (drafting, cornering, apex, etc)? If you answered no to any of these questions, you might need to spend more time than others educating yourself. On the other hand If you have plenty of prior experience and knowledge, getting competent wont take too long. Getting fast though takes awhile. For example, I had a long history with sim racing games from the time I was a young kid and it took me close to a year to really get competitive with the fastest guys. iRacing is like nothing else out there.

&gt; how to get set-ups

1. Make your own

2. Some people share theirs on the forum, you can download from there.

3. [SetupSync](http://iracingsetupsync.nickthissen.nl/). A wonderful application made by a fellow member for sharing and downloading setups. There are thousands of setups available on there for most any car/track combo."

°1 seems like a laptop, so no upgradability, and since those are rather medium-end builds, I'd go with the latter.

For future upgrades, go with GTX 970 or 6700K"	tbh 1's CPU is actually only a tiny bit better than the last ones, especially considering that the 6400 is latest gen architecture, and the i7 is 2 gens old AND a mobile chip. hyperthreadings neat for rendering but few games support it afaik (its useful for player studio tho).

Fair enough. He's been pretty open that he's doing that so China will cooperate on North Korea, though. I support him flip-flopping.

&gt;taking calls from the president of Taiwan, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,” and ""These dummies say, 'Oh, that's a trade war.

You offered to give sources, so I'd like to see sources on him ""flip-flopping"" on any of these things. As far as I know, he never promised to not take calls from Taiwan.

Also the scene of her and Toby when Toby said ""you finished the game"" and Spencer(or Alex) says ""oh I don't remember the word I put"" that was sketchy because when they were talking, she seemed to be in a rush. 

I feel like the kidnapping scene where Mona hit Spencer, was suppose to happen before the dinner. Then that would've made more sense on why it was Alex at the dinner, and not Spencer.

It blows my mind how obsessed people are with the numbers on dps charts that they as a player arn't even good enough to obtain. Worse are the people on suicide watch because their preferred spec is parsing five percent lower than the number one spec. Then you get the people screaming about how they're going to get benched by their raid team because of nerfs. No, you're getting benched because you're a shitty player and your raid team doesn't have the balls to tell you its them.

What gets me is that often the difference between the top and the bottom is 10%, but people act like the last place spec is fucking unplayable and the top spec some unbeatable thundergod...."	"Only true on Normal/Heroic. To clear mythic you do have to min/max, be willing to bench certain players for certain fights, etc. Because in Legion you essentially are able to hit the Ilvl that drops in raids without stepping foot in them.

Genetics, environmental exposures, and social factors far outweigh the influence of diet and exercise in most chronic conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, depression, etc). Good choices can help you manage these conditions, but they rarely prevent them - and this scares most people shitless. 	Muh genetics
5649	dkztdwl	dkzvj5y	AskReddit	Can I ask what type of machine you have at home and how much I could expect to pay for the same one? I've always wanted to design and build my own backpacks and there are so many different machines to choose from.	"Yeah! I have had these same two for many years. They are what I use daily, sometimes 6-8 hours in a stretch. They are both Singers. The lightweight is a 20u, which is a zigzag and straight stitch. The heavy duty is a 531b, which is straight stitch only. I believe Consew has a model just like the 531b; i think the singer was actually made by consew. I bought them both used, and just make sure to take them to the machine spa for their tune up regularly. They are FAST, which is why I love them. The lightweight is only light compared to the heavy duty (I call him The Beast) because it can sew through multiple layers of vinyl or canvas. The Beast, I am convinced, would sew through a finger, though I've yet to test that theory. 
It's been a while since I bought them, but if I remember correctly, I paid about $600 for Beast, and maybe $3-600 for The Little One?  I found her on Craigslist, and drove about an hour to pick her up. They are crazy heavy, as the motor is attached to the table, and you just pull the machine head off and take that part to the repair shop. I've had these two for so long, they feel like an extension of my hands :). 

If you have a sewing machine shop anywhere near you, go in and try some out. If you don't, keep an eye on Craigslist and go visit it. Don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't feel like the right machine for you. They are great machines, but I walked away from one because it hadn't been cared for and it wasn't worth the risk to me. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm actually sitting with The Little One right now, working on a quilt at night. Let me know if you have any other questions! "

In a third world country, yes. You can't send these guys to prison and expect them to reform. The prisons are literally pens where people are kept like animals. Drug dealers bribe the guards and police so they can keep liquor, prostitutes, and drugs flowing to their cells before being released at half-term for ""good behavior.""

5685	dgyxrji	dgyzom2	AskReddit	Kafka covers the Animorph series	[removed]
5686		dkzxfe0	The_Donald		[removed]
5687	czj9vlr	czjdaoz	R6STeams	I have a group of about 10 guys I run with regularly. We are always trying to bring new guys into the fold. GT is Gu1LtYr3mN4nT. Add me and shoot me a message an i'll introduce you to the guys. Should be one in about 20-30 min. 	That would be fantastic! Added on xbl
5688		czjeo7x	AskReddit		"After seeing an episode of south park, I ran around my friends house yelling ""red rocket red rocket!""  I didnt stop until both of my friends parents were clearly angry and my friend told me to stop."
5689	dkzx3lr	dkzx9uk	FloridaMan	That interesting! Do you know of any other states that follows this pattern? 	Not really, with Florida its mostly because city dwellers from other states flock to cities like Miami which are pretty and modern and warm year round. But that's only a small, densely populated, part of the state. The rest of it is basically southern Alabama 
5690	czjfvvk	czjgg82	Vaping	"Your coil resistance has nothing to do with battery amp load on a regulated mod.

Amps=watts/volts

Battery cutoff is 3.2 volts. He4 can handle 25amps, 20amps recommended. 3 batteries in series means total voltage at cutoff is 9.6v

20amps*9.6volts=192 watts.

Keep it under 192 watts and your batteries are safe.

Edit* add in chipset efficiency of a generous 90% and you're at a cap of 172 watts on those batteries to for sure be in the safe zone."	Awesome thanks for the info!
5691		czj8oc8	China		"I started dating a Chinese girl soon after I arrived here. She was totally cool, westernised, hot, and not that young/inexperienced. Did not have any weird vibe or 'marry me!' going on *at all*. 

After meeting her twice, one day the next week she turned up (unannounced) outside my door with a suitcase. She was expecting to stay with me for the next week (and stay home while I went to work) and this was *totally* normal. 

Chinese people are fucked in the head."
5692	diiq9vr	dkzncxv	pocketrumble	Never. Waiting for Switch port	Still waitin!
5693		dgyvws5	Monitors		The Zowie XL2411 (not XL2411Z) is fine (aside from usually being significantly overpriced) once switched from the FPS mode to the Standard mode and is significantly better than the rest, especially since it is PWM/Flicker Free unlike the GN246HL/VG248QE/242G5DJEB.  The XL2411Z has horrible image quality regardless of which settings are used, and both the G2406PF+MG248QE have very washed out colors @144hz, but are still somewhat accurate, and are PWM/Flicker Free.

5699		czj8na7	AskReddit		When my kid was being bullied, we talked to the principal.  The school arranged a meeting with bullies parents.  The bully's mother was absolutely horrified by what her child was doing.  The bullying stopped immediately.
